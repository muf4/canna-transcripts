[00:00.320 --> 00:05.320]  And back in our life's future cannabis project,
[00:07.680 --> 00:10.820]  back here with Brian and Marco Show.
[00:10.820 --> 00:12.740]  Special one for you today, guys.
[00:12.740 --> 00:14.360]  Let's have Brian tell you all about it.
[00:14.360 --> 00:17.160]  But first, whoever placed their bets
[00:17.160 --> 00:19.500]  on the color of Brian's hat,
[00:19.500 --> 00:22.160]  I think it was this man right there
[00:22.160 --> 00:24.360]  coming in with the winning guess.
[00:24.360 --> 00:25.200]  We'll start it off with that.
[00:25.200 --> 00:26.360]  That may be a prize.
[00:27.360 --> 00:31.360]  Well, happy Wednesday to you, Living Soil Nerds.
[00:31.360 --> 00:33.880]  As always, we're trying to come at you,
[00:33.880 --> 00:36.480]  come up with other ideas for the show,
[00:36.480 --> 00:37.880]  just fun ways to interact.
[00:37.880 --> 00:39.600]  Obviously, this is the last show of the year.
[00:39.600 --> 00:42.360]  So we kind of wanted to reach out to our audience
[00:42.360 --> 00:45.200]  and viewers and kind of, I guess,
[00:45.200 --> 00:48.000]  extend ourselves in a way where you can ask us anything.
[00:48.000 --> 00:51.320]  One of the biggest reasons I feel like cannabis
[00:51.320 --> 00:53.240]  is really beginning to evolve
[00:53.240 --> 00:56.320]  and move in such a direction, I feel,
[00:57.160 --> 01:00.320]  is because there's so many educational things out there.
[01:00.320 --> 01:01.640]  It's not just forums anymore.
[01:01.640 --> 01:03.080]  It's not just books.
[01:03.080 --> 01:07.240]  You can sit here and maybe watch a video or two,
[01:07.240 --> 01:08.580]  put a couple hours in a week,
[01:08.580 --> 01:10.480]  and probably gain the same knowledge
[01:10.480 --> 01:13.400]  that people did five, 10 years ago.
[01:13.400 --> 01:14.960]  That would probably take a month to years
[01:14.960 --> 01:17.920]  to really start to understand what's tried and true.
[01:17.920 --> 01:20.040]  So today, we're just gonna kind of go back and forth
[01:20.040 --> 01:22.560]  on ask me anything.
[01:22.560 --> 01:24.480]  Ask us a variety of stuff.
[01:24.520 --> 01:26.600]  When we say ask me anything,
[01:26.600 --> 01:28.520]  yeah, ask us personal stuff.
[01:28.520 --> 01:31.720]  I did like how Marco reacted to some of you guys.
[01:31.720 --> 01:33.400]  Just because we're saying ask us anything,
[01:33.400 --> 01:36.160]  that does not mean that we're gonna answer everything.
[01:36.160 --> 01:39.040]  But for the most part, I bet 99% of you
[01:39.040 --> 01:40.280]  aren't going to do that.
[01:41.520 --> 01:42.960]  Oh, first question.
[01:42.960 --> 01:45.760]  Hey, we were talking about you beforehand, Cheddar Bob.
[01:46.720 --> 01:48.120]  We always love your comments, man.
[01:48.120 --> 01:49.520]  We appreciate everything.
[01:49.520 --> 01:51.060]  My middle name is Edward.
[01:52.060 --> 01:53.700]  Well, guess what?
[01:53.700 --> 01:55.220]  I don't have a middle name.
[01:56.940 --> 01:58.420]  My parents didn't give me one.
[01:58.420 --> 02:00.180]  Marco Thomas, that's it.
[02:01.260 --> 02:02.540]  It's easier to remember.
[02:02.540 --> 02:03.380]  Yeah, happy Wednesday, everybody.
[02:03.380 --> 02:04.380]  But Marco, you wanna kind of run,
[02:04.380 --> 02:07.380]  yeah, you wanna run why we chose to do this, Marco?
[02:07.380 --> 02:09.420]  Yeah, man, happy Wednesday, guys.
[02:09.420 --> 02:10.700]  It's been a long year.
[02:11.540 --> 02:12.660]  Oh, man.
[02:12.660 --> 02:14.420]  You know, like Brian said,
[02:14.420 --> 02:16.100]  we're all about education,
[02:16.100 --> 02:18.060]  spreading education, knowledge,
[02:18.060 --> 02:20.180]  and enlightening each other,
[02:20.220 --> 02:21.900]  and growing as a community.
[02:21.900 --> 02:24.900]  And I just kind of look back on this year, man,
[02:24.900 --> 02:27.920]  and Instagram for me is kind of my little place
[02:27.920 --> 02:29.340]  where I share all my stuff,
[02:29.340 --> 02:32.700]  but it's not with people directly in my community.
[02:32.700 --> 02:35.900]  But yeah, man, I mean, just going back,
[02:35.900 --> 02:38.060]  I shared a lot over the year, you know what I mean?
[02:38.060 --> 02:42.620]  And I probably don't even remember some of it off my head,
[02:42.620 --> 02:45.380]  but I think this show would be great for people to,
[02:45.380 --> 02:47.660]  if you wanna scroll back and kind of look at stuff
[02:47.660 --> 02:49.660]  we talked about earlier in the year,
[02:50.100 --> 02:52.380]  just kind of reflect on the year
[02:52.380 --> 02:54.540]  and think about moving forward.
[02:54.540 --> 02:56.900]  You know, now's the time, ask your questions on,
[02:56.900 --> 03:00.220]  you know, setting up for the upcoming year,
[03:00.220 --> 03:01.580]  you know, outdoors coming,
[03:01.580 --> 03:04.300]  you know, everybody should be indoor right now
[03:04.300 --> 03:05.320]  if you're having issues.
[03:05.320 --> 03:07.860]  You know, shows like this are kind of,
[03:07.860 --> 03:10.540]  I'm here, and Brian, as well as Chad,
[03:10.540 --> 03:13.980]  I mean, we're all here to help folks
[03:13.980 --> 03:15.420]  and to give you guys some knowledge
[03:15.420 --> 03:17.840]  and help you not make some of the mistakes,
[03:17.840 --> 03:19.720]  you know, that we made along the way.
[03:19.720 --> 03:21.520]  And part of why I do this show
[03:21.520 --> 03:23.240]  is because I like to learn as well.
[03:23.240 --> 03:26.080]  You know, usually I have a, we have a great guest on
[03:26.080 --> 03:28.440]  that's very knowledgeable.
[03:28.440 --> 03:30.120]  Today, we don't have that luxury.
[03:30.120 --> 03:33.040]  So we're gonna count on you guys out there
[03:33.040 --> 03:35.600]  to just drop some questions on us
[03:35.600 --> 03:37.900]  and just, you know, have a little fun with it.
[03:40.800 --> 03:42.120]  All right, getting right into it.
[03:42.120 --> 03:46.100]  I use Fox Fork Acid as my pH to have, is that bad?
[03:47.100 --> 03:50.020]  I don't like to.
[03:50.020 --> 03:51.980]  What style of grow are you using?
[03:53.580 --> 03:55.260]  I feel like there's so many variables
[03:55.260 --> 03:56.540]  when it comes to cannabis, guys.
[03:56.540 --> 03:57.960]  So when you ask these questions,
[03:57.960 --> 04:00.260]  it's almost like we need to kind of know context
[04:00.260 --> 04:02.220]  so we can give you the best answer.
[04:02.220 --> 04:04.140]  If you just say, how do I increase yield
[04:04.140 --> 04:04.960]  or something like that?
[04:04.960 --> 04:07.860]  I mean, that's, there's way too many variables for that.
[04:07.860 --> 04:09.580]  And remember when you're farming cannabis,
[04:09.580 --> 04:13.900]  this is a chess person's, this is a thinking person's move.
[04:13.900 --> 04:16.100]  Sometimes you might have to sacrifice a few ponds
[04:16.100 --> 04:17.100]  to make sure that, you know,
[04:17.100 --> 04:19.380]  you're going in and making things the right way.
[04:19.380 --> 04:22.820]  So again, just kind of make sure
[04:22.820 --> 04:24.620]  that those questions have enough detail in them
[04:24.620 --> 04:26.500]  so that we can answer them correctly.
[04:27.460 --> 04:29.820]  Nice, that's very nice.
[04:29.820 --> 04:32.300]  But all right, we'll get to the terrarium in a minute.
[04:32.300 --> 04:35.460]  Hold on, the pH questions.
[04:35.460 --> 04:38.020]  If you're in a living soil setup
[04:38.020 --> 04:40.500]  and you're growing with a large volume of soil,
[04:40.500 --> 04:42.500]  you don't need to pH up or down.
[04:42.500 --> 04:44.360]  I don't bother with pH.
[04:44.360 --> 04:47.060]  I don't even check the acidity of my solutions.
[04:47.060 --> 04:50.580]  I kind of, you know, these inputs we use
[04:50.580 --> 04:53.700]  are diluted fairly well.
[04:53.700 --> 04:56.940]  You know, think of one to 1,000, one teaspoon to one gallon.
[04:56.940 --> 05:00.700]  So when I create a water or soil drench,
[05:00.700 --> 05:02.620]  I don't even pH that.
[05:04.900 --> 05:08.380]  So really, and you shouldn't be chasing things like pH,
[05:08.380 --> 05:09.420]  you know what I mean?
[05:10.260 --> 05:12.620]  That's just a slippery road.
[05:12.620 --> 05:15.380]  I would prefer you did a living soil,
[05:15.380 --> 05:18.340]  large volume of soil and not have to worry about pH.
[05:19.500 --> 05:20.540]  Yeah, I second that.
[05:20.540 --> 05:24.940]  I mean, there's just way too many,
[05:24.940 --> 05:27.180]  there's a lot of thoughts out there,
[05:27.180 --> 05:28.940]  especially when, you know, back in the day,
[05:28.940 --> 05:31.500]  you know, you'd get your blue pen, your pH,
[05:31.500 --> 05:34.540]  your PPM meters and spend all that money.
[05:34.540 --> 05:36.660]  The reality is for people that were using those,
[05:36.660 --> 05:38.120]  as time progressed,
[05:38.120 --> 05:41.400]  a lot of those things aren't as accurate as you think.
[05:41.400 --> 05:42.240]  And then you're, you know,
[05:42.240 --> 05:45.320]  you're basically making decisions on an instrument
[05:45.320 --> 05:47.720]  that isn't even functioning correctly.
[05:47.720 --> 05:49.840]  And so you can have dramatic problems
[05:49.840 --> 05:52.680]  just from you thinking, oh man, my pH is off.
[05:52.680 --> 05:54.120]  And I'll be honest with you guys,
[05:54.120 --> 05:55.380]  when I was first getting into this,
[05:55.380 --> 05:57.960]  using aeroponic systems,
[05:57.960 --> 06:00.880]  using the, you know, the more of the shooting powders
[06:00.880 --> 06:03.520]  and stuff from, I think it was called Aqua Flakes.
[06:04.600 --> 06:06.400]  When we were using that kind of stuff,
[06:06.400 --> 06:09.840]  we would pH up or pH down a little bit too much
[06:09.840 --> 06:10.760]  every single time.
[06:10.760 --> 06:13.040]  And so then we would have to pour the opposite,
[06:13.040 --> 06:14.160]  whatever we had done.
[06:14.160 --> 06:16.800]  And then it was just this classic game of up and down,
[06:16.800 --> 06:18.560]  up and down to where you were like, wow,
[06:18.560 --> 06:19.720]  I can't imagine how much stuff
[06:19.720 --> 06:21.380]  we've actually added into this.
[06:21.380 --> 06:22.700]  So even at a commercial level,
[06:22.700 --> 06:26.560]  when we were running more of like a hydroponic system,
[06:26.560 --> 06:30.120]  I felt like a lot of our issues were because at that time,
[06:30.120 --> 06:32.980]  the facility was so focused on pH
[06:32.980 --> 06:35.920]  that it just caused a variety of issues.
[06:36.440 --> 06:38.480]  So I feel like if you are focused on a living soil,
[06:38.480 --> 06:41.560]  like Marco had mentioned, don't worry about pH.
[06:41.560 --> 06:43.280]  As long as that thing is alive and healthy,
[06:43.280 --> 06:44.160]  if you have problems,
[06:44.160 --> 06:46.220]  you have compaction or something like that,
[06:46.220 --> 06:48.300]  then you need to focus on your soil
[06:48.300 --> 06:52.120]  and those issues will fix themselves
[06:52.120 --> 06:54.720]  because you're basically farming with mother nature.
[06:56.680 --> 06:58.000]  Very true, very true.
[06:59.880 --> 07:04.880]  Yeah, I have been caught myself relying on the meter before
[07:05.360 --> 07:07.680]  where it would calibrate at seven,
[07:07.680 --> 07:09.240]  it would calibrate at four,
[07:09.240 --> 07:11.160]  but in the sweet spot right around six,
[07:11.160 --> 07:15.140]  it was slightly off and I was chasing something
[07:15.140 --> 07:17.520]  based on bad information and I paid for it
[07:17.520 --> 07:19.560]  until I double checked my source
[07:19.560 --> 07:20.680]  and used something different
[07:20.680 --> 07:23.080]  and listened to my eyes basically.
[07:23.080 --> 07:24.840]  So yeah.
[07:24.840 --> 07:26.720]  That's a great point with meters, man.
[07:26.720 --> 07:29.280]  Like you always kind of want to do a backup,
[07:29.280 --> 07:32.640]  at least a check, use your buddies to kind of test
[07:32.640 --> 07:35.640]  if yours is in, if y'all's are both in the same range.
[07:35.640 --> 07:38.680]  But yeah, like you said, those meters, they're not 100.
[07:39.520 --> 07:41.080]  Some of my old pH meters now,
[07:41.080 --> 07:45.080]  they're good for using to check my strength of my vinegars.
[07:45.080 --> 07:47.520]  You know, we're making a lot of vinegars with natural farming
[07:47.520 --> 07:50.920]  so you want a nice acidic vinegar, so low pH.
[07:50.920 --> 07:54.520]  So I use my old hydro meters for stuff like that now.
[07:56.160 --> 07:59.640]  Yeah, I threw mine in the trash and I never looked back.
[07:59.640 --> 08:02.480]  So totally up to you and how you want to do things,
[08:03.320 --> 08:06.280]  but I feel like if you're going into 2022,
[08:06.280 --> 08:08.240]  you're farming cannabis as medicine,
[08:08.240 --> 08:10.840]  you want to build a brand name for yourself,
[08:10.840 --> 08:14.720]  then pH is not the main thing that you need to be focused on.
[08:17.000 --> 08:18.440]  What was that question from Smiley?
[08:18.440 --> 08:19.280]  Shout out to Smiley.
[08:19.280 --> 08:22.080]  Yeah, I was gonna say, let's get up to Smiley here.
[08:22.080 --> 08:25.040]  Can you explain or talk about microbial collapse?
[08:25.040 --> 08:27.620]  And I imagine that there's a variety of ways
[08:27.620 --> 08:29.200]  that this would kick off.
[08:29.200 --> 08:30.960]  It's not just one cause,
[08:31.000 --> 08:33.680]  but I'll let you guys kind of handle that there.
[08:35.440 --> 08:36.960]  Okay, go ahead, Brian.
[08:36.960 --> 08:38.880]  Yeah, okay, so I've personally seen that,
[08:38.880 --> 08:42.420]  especially in the earlier days of making teas
[08:42.420 --> 08:44.120]  and that kind of stuff of,
[08:44.120 --> 08:46.200]  you're basically shooting yourself in the foot
[08:46.200 --> 08:49.440]  with a lot of those things where you're brewing stuff.
[08:49.440 --> 08:52.000]  We were adding so much unsulfured blackstrap molasses
[08:52.000 --> 08:54.880]  at that time that we were basically just,
[08:54.880 --> 08:58.000]  I don't even know, like a sugar type soup
[08:58.000 --> 08:58.980]  that we were creating.
[08:58.980 --> 09:01.500]  And then we were probably brewing it for too long.
[09:01.500 --> 09:04.080]  And what we found out later in life
[09:04.080 --> 09:07.940]  is that we were creating basically these alphas to emerge
[09:07.940 --> 09:09.900]  instead of the diversity that we needed,
[09:09.900 --> 09:13.340]  that we were spending all this time and money and knowledge.
[09:13.340 --> 09:15.500]  I use that, you know, knowledge
[09:15.500 --> 09:18.700]  because it was bad advice and that kind of thing.
[09:18.700 --> 09:22.980]  But going over with the heavy sugars
[09:22.980 --> 09:26.540]  is the only time I've ever seen things collapse
[09:26.540 --> 09:28.500]  and it was self-inflicted.
[09:29.020 --> 09:31.820]  I feel like once everything's alive and thriving,
[09:31.820 --> 09:33.500]  you're never going to experience that
[09:33.500 --> 09:36.420]  as long as you stay focused on feeding that soil system.
[09:36.420 --> 09:39.980]  The real beauty of it is that it's almost comically easy
[09:39.980 --> 09:42.760]  once things start to churn for you.
[09:42.760 --> 09:45.580]  Now, yes, that takes some time and some knowledge
[09:45.580 --> 09:46.860]  to be able to get to that level
[09:46.860 --> 09:48.160]  where things are really churning,
[09:48.160 --> 09:50.020]  you're building that soil food web.
[09:50.020 --> 09:54.200]  But the prize at the end of this marathon, if you will,
[09:54.200 --> 09:56.420]  is that you're going to have a lot more free time
[09:56.420 --> 09:57.380]  back into your life
[09:57.380 --> 09:59.780]  once these things start to churn for you.
[09:59.780 --> 10:03.060]  So microbial collapse for me has only occurred
[10:03.940 --> 10:05.420]  when we were using, at that time,
[10:05.420 --> 10:08.420]  we were also still trying to use like fox farm
[10:08.420 --> 10:11.620]  and build a living soil out of that kind of stuff.
[10:11.620 --> 10:15.340]  So again, your ingredients and really the time and stuff,
[10:15.340 --> 10:19.220]  you know, stay focused on the teas that you're making.
[10:19.220 --> 10:21.780]  Simple is best with that kind of stuff.
[10:21.780 --> 10:23.260]  And the diversity is key.
[10:23.260 --> 10:25.180]  I know we said that all year long,
[10:25.340 --> 10:27.460]  but that really is kind of the,
[10:27.460 --> 10:31.020]  sometimes in life, the silly, easy things,
[10:31.020 --> 10:33.580]  people, you know, you get you those aha moments.
[10:33.580 --> 10:36.140]  An aha moment is really to keep things simple
[10:36.140 --> 10:38.040]  when you're making those compost teas.
[10:38.940 --> 10:40.140]  Great points.
[10:40.140 --> 10:41.860]  Yeah, I'll add to that too, Brian.
[10:42.740 --> 10:45.940]  Just for an example, like a microscope
[10:45.940 --> 10:49.700]  is a very valuable tool when you're making teas.
[10:49.700 --> 10:53.680]  And like Brian said, you know, you can over brew a tea.
[10:53.680 --> 10:54.880]  You know, if you take a tea
[10:54.880 --> 10:57.480]  and you start with a very good, rich compost
[10:57.480 --> 11:00.840]  and you add some molasses, if that's your thing,
[11:00.840 --> 11:03.800]  or for me, I like to add like a rice flour
[11:03.800 --> 11:05.880]  or another simple starch.
[11:05.880 --> 11:10.520]  So what will happen is if you brew too long,
[11:10.520 --> 11:14.080]  like Brian said, you can create a brew
[11:14.080 --> 11:15.960]  where one type of bacteria,
[11:15.960 --> 11:18.720]  one type of microbe becomes dominant.
[11:18.720 --> 11:20.960]  For example, if you're brewing a tea
[11:20.960 --> 11:24.500]  and you add lab too early or too much LAB,
[11:25.760 --> 11:27.920]  those are called the police for a reason.
[11:27.920 --> 11:31.000]  They will overcome, out-compete and dominate your brew.
[11:31.000 --> 11:34.280]  So you will end up mostly with a lab tea at the end of that
[11:34.280 --> 11:35.360]  if you don't watch it.
[11:36.360 --> 11:40.120]  Liquid IMO is a good example of microbial collapse.
[11:40.120 --> 11:42.960]  Or even before that, we can say JMS,
[11:42.960 --> 11:44.880]  Jadam Microbe Solution.
[11:44.880 --> 11:48.040]  Just an example that you can see with your eyes is,
[11:48.040 --> 11:49.880]  you know, with Jadam Microbe Solution,
[11:49.880 --> 11:52.880]  you add a simple starch like potato,
[11:52.880 --> 11:55.720]  a little bit of sea salt, some water,
[11:55.720 --> 11:57.880]  and then some microorganisms.
[11:57.880 --> 12:01.800]  Don't bubble, don't stir it, just let it sit.
[12:01.800 --> 12:04.920]  The bubbles are an indication of the microbial activity
[12:04.920 --> 12:08.320]  and you should use it when the bubbles are at their peak.
[12:08.320 --> 12:09.960]  If you wait a day too long
[12:09.960 --> 12:12.340]  and those bubbles start dissolving,
[12:12.340 --> 12:15.120]  what that means is the biology in that bucket
[12:15.120 --> 12:17.040]  is also diminishing.
[12:17.040 --> 12:19.440]  And so really you can have a microbial collapse
[12:20.000 --> 12:22.160]  and you really could end up with just, you know,
[12:22.160 --> 12:24.360]  water at the end of a long enough brew
[12:24.360 --> 12:29.360]  if you don't culture the right microorganisms.
[12:31.160 --> 12:33.480]  Just like with a liquid IMO,
[12:33.480 --> 12:35.680]  I like to use a microscope on that.
[12:37.040 --> 12:39.500]  You can guess, and I've found that the sweet spot
[12:39.500 --> 12:42.280]  for a liquid IMO is about 36 hours.
[12:42.280 --> 12:45.440]  But with that microscope, what you're doing along the way
[12:45.440 --> 12:46.480]  is you're checking it.
[12:46.480 --> 12:49.520]  So you're visually seeing, okay, now I see spores,
[12:49.520 --> 12:51.840]  you know, first check after 12 hours.
[12:51.840 --> 12:54.880]  24 hours, you start to see a little bit of fungi,
[12:54.880 --> 12:58.120]  spores are starting to grow.
[12:58.120 --> 13:00.000]  And then after getting close to 36,
[13:00.000 --> 13:03.120]  you're starting to see long strands of fungi.
[13:03.120 --> 13:04.800]  If you don't harvest that liquid IMO
[13:04.800 --> 13:07.200]  and use it at a certain point,
[13:07.200 --> 13:08.520]  you'll diminish what you have.
[13:08.520 --> 13:11.480]  So microbial collapse, I wouldn't worry about it in my soil
[13:11.480 --> 13:14.580]  unless you did something like put salt fertilizers
[13:14.580 --> 13:16.880]  in a living soil, which none of us would do.
[13:17.860 --> 13:19.020]  But those are just some examples
[13:19.020 --> 13:21.220]  of what I know about microbial collapse.
[13:21.220 --> 13:22.940]  And hopefully that's kind of what you guys
[13:22.940 --> 13:24.780]  were talking about in that question.
[13:26.060 --> 13:28.980]  Yeah, and I think real quick to add a myth
[13:28.980 --> 13:31.580]  when we were around was that the foam or the froth
[13:31.580 --> 13:33.220]  that was coming off those compost teas
[13:33.220 --> 13:35.900]  meant that it was a high quality compost.
[13:35.900 --> 13:37.540]  And that is a myth.
[13:37.540 --> 13:40.380]  You can make high quality compost without any froth.
[13:40.380 --> 13:42.620]  And I can personally tell you if I added a little,
[13:42.620 --> 13:47.620]  maybe a 16th of a teaspoon or maybe a little bit more
[13:48.260 --> 13:51.420]  to a five gallon tea bucket of yucca extract,
[13:51.420 --> 13:53.980]  I would make the frothiest looking compost tea
[13:53.980 --> 13:54.940]  you've ever seen in your life.
[13:54.940 --> 13:56.460]  Did that mean that it was a quality tea?
[13:56.460 --> 13:57.300]  Absolutely not.
[13:58.260 --> 13:59.100]  Yeah, good point.
[13:59.100 --> 14:01.140]  That's why I like the JMS guys
[14:01.140 --> 14:04.160]  because really Jadam doesn't even wanna,
[14:04.160 --> 14:06.940]  they don't even use like mechanical brewers,
[14:06.940 --> 14:08.040]  for the most part.
[14:08.940 --> 14:11.300]  And I would say when you're starting out brewing,
[14:11.300 --> 14:15.780]  use a simple brews, potato, starch, water, microbes,
[14:15.780 --> 14:17.820]  use that first.
[14:17.820 --> 14:19.700]  Brewing can be a challenge.
[14:19.700 --> 14:22.740]  You're not gonna necessarily do anything
[14:22.740 --> 14:24.380]  that's gonna ruin your soil
[14:24.380 --> 14:26.460]  or be too harmful for your plants,
[14:26.460 --> 14:30.300]  but you can, if you're making brews and they're not right
[14:30.300 --> 14:31.660]  and you're doing that repeatedly,
[14:31.660 --> 14:35.060]  you can increase the wrong proportions of microbes
[14:35.060 --> 14:36.980]  in your soil, not even know it.
[14:36.980 --> 14:37.820]  So.
[14:40.340 --> 14:43.440]  And going back to something that you can do in the soil,
[14:45.260 --> 14:47.100]  if you're coming into the living soil,
[14:47.100 --> 14:49.860]  you're used to a little bit of dry, wet, dry, wet.
[14:49.860 --> 14:51.420]  Now, from what I understand,
[14:51.420 --> 14:54.480]  if you let your living soil get too dry,
[14:54.480 --> 14:57.540]  that can also kind of start a chain reaction
[14:57.540 --> 15:00.540]  of microbial collapse in the soil.
[15:00.540 --> 15:02.720]  Is that kind of on point?
[15:03.720 --> 15:07.800]  Yeah, I mean, if, with anything with a living soil system,
[15:07.800 --> 15:10.320]  again, you're the coach, you're the mentor.
[15:10.320 --> 15:13.240]  So if everybody is on the field and not playing their part,
[15:13.240 --> 15:16.280]  then you're gonna have potentially huge issues.
[15:16.280 --> 15:18.640]  So the main focus when you're in a living soil system
[15:18.640 --> 15:21.680]  is to really, especially if you're first getting into this,
[15:21.680 --> 15:23.800]  is focus on that soil.
[15:23.800 --> 15:26.440]  You know, the plants are going to react,
[15:26.440 --> 15:28.080]  especially when you're first getting into this,
[15:28.080 --> 15:30.720]  you know, the plants might not look as healthy as you think
[15:30.720 --> 15:32.120]  because things are churning out.
[15:32.520 --> 15:35.800]  Don't get nervous and run like Marco had mentioned
[15:35.800 --> 15:37.200]  and go get a bunch of salts
[15:37.200 --> 15:38.760]  and dump a bunch of salts in there.
[15:38.760 --> 15:41.080]  The plant probably will perk up, right?
[15:41.080 --> 15:44.320]  I mean, it's chelated nutrients, right?
[15:44.320 --> 15:46.480]  Meaning that the plant can take it up
[15:46.480 --> 15:48.600]  practically right then and there.
[15:48.600 --> 15:51.360]  The issue with that is that it's going to cause
[15:51.360 --> 15:54.700]  the microbial life to die off or hinder itself.
[15:54.700 --> 15:57.320]  So you're kind of in this catch 22,
[15:57.320 --> 15:59.040]  spinning your wheels where you're like,
[15:59.040 --> 16:00.660]  all right, I am growing in a living soil,
[16:00.660 --> 16:02.860]  but I'm always grabbing off the shelf
[16:02.860 --> 16:05.140]  or, you know, choosing to make ferments
[16:05.140 --> 16:08.460]  that I think Marco and I would consider
[16:08.460 --> 16:11.400]  almost kind of silly for a living soil system.
[16:11.400 --> 16:14.300]  This isn't, I think that's why so many people,
[16:14.300 --> 16:15.700]  I'll talk about myself.
[16:15.700 --> 16:18.460]  I know that the reason why I was able to here in Colorado
[16:18.460 --> 16:20.020]  to compete against other people
[16:20.020 --> 16:23.420]  that were way better farmers in general,
[16:23.420 --> 16:25.300]  better cannabis farmers,
[16:25.300 --> 16:27.820]  is because I was using mother nature.
[16:27.820 --> 16:29.760]  So that really is that big difference.
[16:29.800 --> 16:32.480]  So you don't necessarily have to have a PhD in botany
[16:32.480 --> 16:34.720]  to be able to start a living soil system.
[16:34.720 --> 16:36.400]  I'm educated in Georgia, I can tell you,
[16:36.400 --> 16:38.360]  I didn't get the best education.
[16:38.360 --> 16:42.000]  But the fact is I have a tenacity for, you know,
[16:42.000 --> 16:43.360]  educating myself.
[16:43.360 --> 16:45.500]  And I feel like that's where a lot of living soil farmers
[16:45.500 --> 16:47.520]  come in and will succeed
[16:47.520 --> 16:49.440]  because they're going to take that initiative.
[16:49.440 --> 16:52.180]  They're going to see a few things with their own eye
[16:52.180 --> 16:54.000]  that's going to give them the confidence to be like,
[16:54.000 --> 16:56.160]  all right, this is obviously the future for me.
[16:56.160 --> 16:58.520]  And then I encourage you guys to run with that,
[16:58.520 --> 17:01.520]  guys and girls to run with that kind of stuff.
[17:01.520 --> 17:03.600]  You know, Marco, we had mentioned like
[17:03.600 --> 17:06.120]  the younger generations, like King Jay,
[17:06.120 --> 17:08.760]  I think is one of the ones I love to talk about.
[17:08.760 --> 17:11.960]  It's just people that when probably Marco and I
[17:11.960 --> 17:13.380]  were first getting into this,
[17:13.380 --> 17:15.280]  was a really young buck, right?
[17:15.280 --> 17:17.600]  And now the fact that, you know, 10 years go by
[17:17.600 --> 17:19.960]  and now all of a sudden people like King Jay
[17:19.960 --> 17:23.280]  and a variety of other farmers have all of this knowledge,
[17:23.280 --> 17:26.600]  they're going to be able to surpass all of us.
[17:26.600 --> 17:27.800]  And that's the way it should be.
[17:27.800 --> 17:30.040]  And I feel like some of the old guards get a little
[17:30.040 --> 17:32.320]  maybe jealous or upset about that.
[17:32.320 --> 17:33.760]  But with the living soil crowd,
[17:33.760 --> 17:35.440]  it's really hard to get upset about that
[17:35.440 --> 17:39.160]  because this is the way that we're going to combat big ag.
[17:39.160 --> 17:41.680]  And if we all don't kind of get together
[17:41.680 --> 17:43.680]  and join forces, if you will,
[17:43.680 --> 17:45.840]  at least with the knowledge base,
[17:45.840 --> 17:49.580]  it's going to be really hard for medicinal cannabis
[17:49.580 --> 17:52.800]  to survive at any quality level,
[17:52.800 --> 17:55.400]  because I assure you that big companies could care less
[17:55.400 --> 17:57.160]  about the medicinal aspect.
[17:58.800 --> 18:00.160]  What I'll say.
[18:00.160 --> 18:01.080]  Yeah.
[18:01.080 --> 18:02.260]  That's so true.
[18:02.260 --> 18:05.920]  I mean, in me and my life, I relate that to skateboarding.
[18:05.920 --> 18:07.200]  It's the things that we were doing
[18:07.200 --> 18:08.960]  that would have got you sponsored back in the day
[18:08.960 --> 18:10.520]  are now the things that the five-year-olds
[18:10.520 --> 18:11.840]  are doing at the parks.
[18:11.840 --> 18:13.000]  So it's that progression.
[18:13.000 --> 18:14.160]  That's the way it should be, right?
[18:14.160 --> 18:15.480]  You see people do it and you're just like,
[18:15.480 --> 18:16.920]  oh, well, that's what you do.
[18:16.920 --> 18:18.920]  You didn't realize that it was a hard struggle
[18:18.920 --> 18:20.520]  to get to that point.
[18:20.520 --> 18:21.360]  Yeah.
[18:21.360 --> 18:23.400]  That's like the recent,
[18:23.400 --> 18:25.120]  a lot of people have seen at the video,
[18:25.120 --> 18:28.200]  the meme with the baby doing the water skiing.
[18:28.200 --> 18:30.280]  The kid, this is like a one-year-old
[18:30.280 --> 18:31.680]  and he's holding a pole.
[18:31.680 --> 18:34.120]  And like I was talking to my wife,
[18:34.120 --> 18:37.120]  like that kid doesn't know he can't do that.
[18:37.120 --> 18:39.320]  Like you can't limit yourself.
[18:39.320 --> 18:41.520]  One of my things, I don't limit myself.
[18:41.520 --> 18:43.520]  I don't tell myself what I can't do.
[18:43.520 --> 18:44.680]  And you shouldn't do that.
[18:44.680 --> 18:46.680]  You should always seek a way to do it.
[18:46.680 --> 18:47.800]  You know, if you can't do it
[18:47.800 --> 18:50.560]  or you don't know how to do it at this time.
[18:50.560 --> 18:54.200]  Great points on the knowledge and learning.
[18:54.360 --> 18:56.240]  All we can at this time.
[18:56.240 --> 18:58.280]  Here's what I think the key is.
[18:58.280 --> 19:00.280]  Big business is gonna come in.
[19:00.280 --> 19:04.360]  One day it's gonna be legal 100% all over the country.
[19:04.360 --> 19:06.200]  Big business is waiting on that.
[19:07.120 --> 19:09.320]  I don't care what big business is doing.
[19:09.320 --> 19:11.480]  What I'm doing right now is I'm focusing
[19:11.480 --> 19:13.600]  on a group of people that I know
[19:13.600 --> 19:16.800]  and you guys that we're all talking to every week.
[19:16.800 --> 19:21.360]  And we're focused on craft cannabis.
[19:21.360 --> 19:24.760]  Getting our craft as tight as possible.
[19:24.760 --> 19:27.320]  Making our own inputs.
[19:27.320 --> 19:30.200]  Using those inputs in the right ways.
[19:30.200 --> 19:32.040]  Big ag can't do that.
[19:32.040 --> 19:33.640]  They'll never be able to do that.
[19:33.640 --> 19:37.400]  They'll never be able to go across the street,
[19:37.400 --> 19:41.400]  get some persimmons, make them into a vinegar,
[19:41.400 --> 19:43.520]  use them as part of my maintenance solution
[19:43.520 --> 19:45.320]  and natural farming.
[19:45.320 --> 19:47.680]  Big ag is always gonna have a middleman in there
[19:47.680 --> 19:50.080]  and they're gonna take us away from, you know,
[19:50.120 --> 19:53.480]  our roots, which is close to our farms and our gardens.
[19:53.480 --> 19:57.200]  So we gotta, let's just focus on the craft aspect.
[19:57.200 --> 19:59.200]  And to me, living soil, this is where we do it.
[19:59.200 --> 20:01.800]  Like big ag is already doing the salts, guys.
[20:01.800 --> 20:03.720]  Like they do it better than anybody else.
[20:03.720 --> 20:06.400]  So why would you go down that road
[20:06.400 --> 20:09.320]  where they're already doing it as better than anyone else?
[20:09.320 --> 20:11.000]  We're doing craft cannabis.
[20:11.000 --> 20:12.640]  We're doing natural farming.
[20:12.640 --> 20:14.520]  They don't know how to do this.
[20:14.520 --> 20:17.240]  So this is the road we need to steer down,
[20:17.240 --> 20:18.880]  you know, for our future.
[20:18.880 --> 20:20.120]  Why would you take a future
[20:20.120 --> 20:22.560]  where you're doing it exactly like big ag?
[20:22.560 --> 20:24.680]  To me, that doesn't have a future.
[20:24.680 --> 20:27.120]  So natural farming is the way.
[20:27.120 --> 20:30.080]  Just think, man, like, you know, craft beer.
[20:30.080 --> 20:31.320]  Everyone loves craft beer.
[20:31.320 --> 20:35.520]  Some people do like Budweiser, name the brand you want.
[20:35.520 --> 20:39.040]  But for the majority, the craft stuff tastes better.
[20:39.040 --> 20:41.160]  It's better for you, it's better ingredients.
[20:41.160 --> 20:44.880]  And that's all exactly the same for our match, you know?
[20:44.880 --> 20:48.440]  So that's my kind of my input on how do you survive
[20:49.000 --> 20:49.840]  a big ag?
[20:49.840 --> 20:50.680]  A lot of people ask me that.
[20:50.680 --> 20:52.800]  And to be honest, it doesn't scare me
[20:52.800 --> 20:56.400]  because they can't do what I can do, you know?
[20:56.400 --> 20:58.280]  And that should be your attitude too.
[20:59.280 --> 21:02.280]  And I learned something in a marketing course
[21:02.280 --> 21:03.360]  that I was taking as well.
[21:03.360 --> 21:05.640]  Like as things are progressing, right?
[21:05.640 --> 21:07.600]  Everyone started to get on the internet.
[21:07.600 --> 21:09.960]  Then, you know, basically now you go to Google
[21:09.960 --> 21:11.800]  and if it's not on the first or second page,
[21:11.800 --> 21:13.880]  you're gonna redo that search.
[21:13.880 --> 21:17.240]  So what happens five years from now, 10 years from now
[21:17.320 --> 21:18.760]  for cannabis brands?
[21:18.760 --> 21:21.880]  I sadly see a lot of people now saying,
[21:21.880 --> 21:25.280]  Alexa, I need the best cannabis brand in Oklahoma
[21:25.280 --> 21:29.200]  or, you know, whatever the new popping off places, right?
[21:29.200 --> 21:33.920]  And so Alexa is going to pull one source for you.
[21:33.920 --> 21:36.520]  She's going to, you know, the robot's going to tell you
[21:36.520 --> 21:38.760]  one specific place to go to.
[21:38.760 --> 21:41.080]  So now, you know, you as a company,
[21:41.080 --> 21:43.280]  it's gonna be really hard to compete against that
[21:43.280 --> 21:44.800]  unless you have a brand.
[21:44.800 --> 21:47.080]  And in my opinion, the only way that you're going
[21:47.920 --> 21:49.320]  to have a brand in the cannabis space,
[21:49.320 --> 21:51.840]  especially moving forward into 2022,
[21:51.840 --> 21:55.840]  is to have that brand and have that brand be so well known
[21:55.840 --> 21:56.880]  that when someone says,
[21:56.880 --> 21:58.720]  hey, I want the best cannabis in Colorado,
[21:58.720 --> 22:01.600]  that it pulls up, you know, some of the better brands.
[22:01.600 --> 22:05.360]  I think the choice for the consumer here
[22:05.360 --> 22:08.080]  is going to be limited by marketing.
[22:08.080 --> 22:10.400]  I mean, sadly, that's kind of where the future is going.
[22:10.400 --> 22:13.000]  So not only do you need to focus on your farming
[22:13.000 --> 22:13.840]  and that kind of stuff,
[22:14.280 --> 22:17.040]  you definitely need to dial in your branding.
[22:17.040 --> 22:19.320]  And I feel like a lot of the farms,
[22:19.320 --> 22:23.240]  personal friends of mine and stuff that, in my opinion,
[22:23.240 --> 22:24.600]  probably grow some of the best cannabis,
[22:24.600 --> 22:25.880]  but nobody knows about them
[22:25.880 --> 22:28.080]  because they've never spent the time doing the marketing
[22:28.080 --> 22:29.080]  or the branding.
[22:29.080 --> 22:30.960]  And I know a lot of you guys might even been rolling
[22:30.960 --> 22:32.120]  your eyes at that kind of stuff.
[22:32.120 --> 22:33.120]  Like, oh, who gives a shit?
[22:33.120 --> 22:35.320]  If it's good weed, it'll sell itself.
[22:35.320 --> 22:38.440]  Yes, if you can get out there, what are you going to do?
[22:38.440 --> 22:39.960]  Give out samples to everybody?
[22:39.960 --> 22:42.440]  I mean, that's just not feasible.
[22:42.440 --> 22:44.880]  So as you're building your farm,
[22:44.880 --> 22:47.000]  you also need to take that same amount of time,
[22:47.000 --> 22:49.200]  same amount of energy to build your brand.
[22:49.200 --> 22:51.240]  Otherwise you're going to fall to the wayside
[22:51.240 --> 22:52.800]  or you're going to be selling all your pounds
[22:52.800 --> 22:56.040]  between six and 800 bucks in a race to the bottom.
[22:56.040 --> 22:59.600]  Even though it's quality cannabis,
[22:59.600 --> 23:01.920]  from what I've seen in some of these newer states
[23:01.920 --> 23:03.000]  that are emerging,
[23:03.000 --> 23:05.320]  they're paying lower prices for the flower
[23:05.320 --> 23:07.920]  and then they're not passing those savings
[23:07.920 --> 23:09.520]  onto the consumer.
[23:09.560 --> 23:13.120]  So we have to kind of, again, join forces as a community
[23:13.120 --> 23:15.280]  and educate everybody to the fact that like,
[23:15.280 --> 23:18.640]  hey, high-end cannabis, high-end solvent-less stuff
[23:18.640 --> 23:20.360]  takes a lot more time.
[23:20.360 --> 23:23.280]  And once the consumer understands that or the process,
[23:23.280 --> 23:25.680]  like shout out to some of our guests
[23:25.680 --> 23:26.960]  that we've had on the show,
[23:26.960 --> 23:29.280]  I encourage you guys to go back and talk to some,
[23:29.280 --> 23:30.280]  or watch the videos,
[23:30.280 --> 23:32.920]  maybe reach out to some of these concentrate makers,
[23:32.920 --> 23:34.920]  solvent-less concentrate makers,
[23:34.920 --> 23:38.320]  and see in real time how long and how much love
[23:39.200 --> 23:41.640]  the hatch water hands and that kind of stuff,
[23:41.640 --> 23:43.600]  what it really takes to make that product.
[23:43.600 --> 23:47.000]  And then I don't think you're going to feel as jaded
[23:47.000 --> 23:50.400]  paying maybe 40, 50 bucks a gram retail.
[23:53.120 --> 23:54.640]  And I just want to say too,
[23:54.640 --> 23:57.680]  a lot of times artists are brilliant artists,
[23:57.680 --> 23:59.480]  but they're not the best business person.
[23:59.480 --> 24:01.960]  So a lot of times, growers,
[24:01.960 --> 24:03.800]  it might be a good opportunity
[24:03.800 --> 24:06.760]  to look for somebody that specializes in this close to you
[24:06.760 --> 24:09.160]  in your network and kind of work together.
[24:09.160 --> 24:11.040]  You focus on what you do best
[24:11.040 --> 24:12.520]  because that's going to make your product
[24:12.520 --> 24:14.360]  at the end of the day.
[24:14.360 --> 24:16.520]  And let somebody else handle some of the other things
[24:16.520 --> 24:19.000]  because they're really two full-time jobs.
[24:19.000 --> 24:22.120]  So, excellent point there.
[24:22.120 --> 24:23.400]  And you're going to perish
[24:23.400 --> 24:25.200]  if you don't master both of those.
[24:25.200 --> 24:26.600]  You have to, yeah.
[24:26.600 --> 24:28.240]  It's just the way of the world.
[24:28.240 --> 24:30.320]  So you're either going to bend with it a little bit
[24:30.320 --> 24:32.280]  and move forward and adjust,
[24:32.280 --> 24:34.000]  or you're going to get passed up.
[24:34.000 --> 24:36.760]  And I've seen many, many places do that.
[24:36.760 --> 24:38.440]  Many places that were well-funded,
[24:38.440 --> 24:40.600]  I've seen kind of have to sell the farm
[24:40.600 --> 24:42.600]  because nobody knew about them.
[24:42.600 --> 24:44.800]  And that's, I mean, how sad could that be?
[24:44.800 --> 24:46.360]  You're putting out a quality product
[24:46.360 --> 24:48.080]  yet nobody knows about it.
[24:48.080 --> 24:52.000]  Yeah, that's gotta be like, that's the worst right there.
[24:52.000 --> 24:54.880]  Can't even share what you got.
[24:54.880 --> 24:56.600]  Well, here's kind of a fun one
[24:56.600 --> 24:59.240]  because you guys have had an awesome year
[24:59.240 --> 25:00.600]  with a lot of awesome guests.
[25:00.600 --> 25:02.960]  I've enjoyed personally having a front row seat
[25:02.960 --> 25:04.320]  to all of this stuff.
[25:06.120 --> 25:07.720]  Do you guys have any favorite moments
[25:07.720 --> 25:10.520]  or maybe good conversations
[25:10.520 --> 25:13.840]  or portions of conversations from this first year?
[25:13.840 --> 25:15.920]  I know one blooper.
[25:18.040 --> 25:20.680]  Well, I watched the, when Duke was on,
[25:20.680 --> 25:21.840]  I watched that show back
[25:21.840 --> 25:25.040]  and I didn't realize when I was doing the mic test,
[25:25.040 --> 25:28.080]  the lady was singing the song and everybody could hear it.
[25:28.960 --> 25:31.800]  Oh yeah, the little improv music.
[25:32.640 --> 25:33.920]  Yeah, I thought that was funny,
[25:33.920 --> 25:36.240]  but yeah, Duke was a great show, man.
[25:36.240 --> 25:39.120]  I think for us, all our, I loved all our guests at this point
[25:39.120 --> 25:43.280]  let me think of some real hits while Brian goes.
[25:43.280 --> 25:46.480]  And I wanna give a shout out to Ty, Loyalty Cannabis,
[25:46.480 --> 25:49.040]  just one of those dudes that is real.
[25:49.040 --> 25:51.880]  I think Marco and I, especially in Vegas, man,
[25:51.880 --> 25:53.680]  I learned a lot about individuals
[25:53.680 --> 25:58.040]  and the fact of not everybody truly is for the people.
[25:58.040 --> 25:59.760]  As soon as you tell them that they're not gonna get the money
[25:59.800 --> 26:03.360]  or Marco and myself, we've done events,
[26:03.360 --> 26:05.240]  we do this obviously every single week
[26:05.240 --> 26:07.680]  and we don't get paid for that.
[26:07.680 --> 26:10.800]  And I feel like a lot of the individuals
[26:10.800 --> 26:14.560]  that even that we kind of ran with beforehand
[26:14.560 --> 26:16.560]  showed their true colors in this last year.
[26:16.560 --> 26:19.280]  And I'm really thankful for that part.
[26:19.280 --> 26:22.160]  I would like to say that my favorite moment of this
[26:22.160 --> 26:25.360]  has just kind of been the whole overall experience,
[26:25.360 --> 26:29.240]  growing subpar cannabis, learning about living soil
[26:29.760 --> 26:31.520]  and then kind of being able to interview some of the guys
[26:31.520 --> 26:33.680]  that I've looked up to for years now
[26:33.680 --> 26:34.840]  and just picking their brain.
[26:34.840 --> 26:36.640]  And hopefully I was able to ask the questions
[26:36.640 --> 26:39.240]  that you guys were thinking about.
[26:39.240 --> 26:41.800]  But a lot of the people that we've had on the show,
[26:43.040 --> 26:44.600]  I guess I don't have a problem saying this,
[26:44.600 --> 26:46.360]  but I admire a lot of those guys.
[26:46.360 --> 26:47.840]  I mean, these are pioneers.
[26:47.840 --> 26:50.440]  And especially if you were doing this when it was illegal,
[26:50.440 --> 26:54.200]  hats off to you because not only were you farming cannabis,
[26:54.200 --> 26:56.920]  but you're gambling with your life.
[26:56.920 --> 27:00.000]  Some of us were gambling even with our family's lives.
[27:00.000 --> 27:02.080]  If you go away, what's gonna happen?
[27:02.080 --> 27:05.200]  So I'm just happy to see that a lot of the old school
[27:05.200 --> 27:06.360]  farmers are still out there.
[27:06.360 --> 27:09.120]  And if you guys, I'm sure you guys know
[27:09.120 --> 27:11.080]  a lot of the people that we're talking about,
[27:11.080 --> 27:12.360]  go and support them.
[27:12.360 --> 27:14.640]  When you do go to the state that they're at,
[27:14.640 --> 27:19.280]  buy their cannabis, just kind of support the OGs,
[27:19.280 --> 27:20.120]  if you will.
[27:20.120 --> 27:21.960]  And some of the newer ones that are coming up,
[27:21.960 --> 27:23.000]  support them as well.
[27:23.040 --> 27:27.240]  But I just think when we're voting with our money,
[27:27.240 --> 27:31.440]  I hope that you guys choose to maybe do a tiny bit
[27:31.440 --> 27:33.360]  of research and find out who's been doing it
[27:33.360 --> 27:38.360]  the correct way or as best as they can with laws
[27:38.800 --> 27:39.640]  and that kind of stuff,
[27:39.640 --> 27:42.040]  where the overall goal of that farmer
[27:42.040 --> 27:44.080]  was to create high-end medicine.
[27:44.080 --> 27:46.520]  And if that's their overall goal, then please support them
[27:46.520 --> 27:48.040]  because there's so many people out there
[27:48.040 --> 27:50.480]  that are just fugazi individuals
[27:50.520 --> 27:53.160]  that will tell you all kinds of warm, loving stories
[27:53.160 --> 27:54.600]  about what they wanna do.
[27:54.600 --> 27:56.360]  But behind the scenes, they could care less
[27:56.360 --> 27:57.760]  unless they're making money.
[27:58.640 --> 28:00.160]  Yeah, definitely.
[28:00.160 --> 28:02.040]  Look for, you know, one of the things I look for
[28:02.040 --> 28:05.240]  is the people that inspire me are people
[28:05.240 --> 28:06.880]  that actually do things.
[28:06.880 --> 28:09.640]  Like there's a big difference between doing
[28:09.640 --> 28:11.520]  and just talking about doing.
[28:12.600 --> 28:14.200]  I look for those guys that are constantly,
[28:14.200 --> 28:15.720]  like last week, Resin Ranch.
[28:15.720 --> 28:18.400]  I mean, just for example, I mean, he's always in his stories.
[28:18.400 --> 28:19.400]  He doesn't post a lot.
[28:19.400 --> 28:20.760]  So if you go look at his posts,
[28:20.760 --> 28:23.320]  you might think he's not very active,
[28:23.320 --> 28:25.800]  but that man is super active.
[28:25.800 --> 28:29.240]  I mean, so clean, like I was so impressed.
[28:29.240 --> 28:31.360]  Like, and one reason I, you know,
[28:31.360 --> 28:34.360]  kind of got away from, well, not I didn't get away,
[28:34.360 --> 28:38.600]  but I didn't go to the processing and that kind of thing
[28:38.600 --> 28:40.560]  was just that I hadn't really felt like
[28:40.560 --> 28:44.040]  I had a way of doing it or saw a way of doing it
[28:44.040 --> 28:47.360]  that I really respected and could kind of dial in
[28:47.360 --> 28:48.640]  and make my own.
[28:48.640 --> 28:51.760]  And the way the man does a dry sift was just,
[28:51.760 --> 28:52.600]  it's just crazy.
[28:52.600 --> 28:54.920]  So it was definitely inspiring to me.
[28:56.080 --> 28:57.960]  You know, going back to Bee Leaf, man,
[28:57.960 --> 29:00.400]  I mean, the way that man, you guys,
[29:00.400 --> 29:03.120]  future boom, boom, fire.
[29:03.120 --> 29:05.560]  I got the, yeah, there we go.
[29:05.560 --> 29:06.600]  Boom fire.
[29:06.600 --> 29:08.080]  That's right.
[29:08.080 --> 29:10.000]  One cool thing about that man,
[29:10.000 --> 29:12.200]  if y'all don't realize it, I mean,
[29:12.200 --> 29:17.200]  they put in the work, like 6,500 seeds in a hunt.
[29:17.560 --> 29:18.400]  You know what I mean?
[29:19.160 --> 29:20.680]  For an example, I mean, it doesn't do that every time,
[29:20.680 --> 29:22.960]  but he pops thousands regularly.
[29:23.960 --> 29:26.360]  You know, just doing a little home grow,
[29:26.360 --> 29:27.640]  eight or 10 is cool.
[29:27.640 --> 29:29.560]  But when you really want to go out there looking
[29:29.560 --> 29:32.440]  for the best of the best, seek those kinds of guys,
[29:32.440 --> 29:34.880]  use those guys to start your foundation.
[29:34.880 --> 29:35.920]  You know what I mean?
[29:37.200 --> 29:40.600]  Me being in Virginia, man, I've never had the luxury
[29:40.600 --> 29:43.440]  of, you know, just calling a guy or reaching out
[29:43.440 --> 29:46.360]  and saying, can I have a, you send me a clone
[29:46.360 --> 29:48.400]  or a cut or great genetics.
[29:48.400 --> 29:52.880]  It's always been, y'all know them Dutch seed companies
[29:52.880 --> 29:54.360]  from back in the day, you're risking,
[29:54.360 --> 29:57.080]  you're ordering shit, they send you a t-shirt,
[29:57.080 --> 29:59.480]  inside the t-shirt might be a CD case,
[29:59.480 --> 30:02.360]  inside the CD case, you get one fucking seed or something.
[30:02.360 --> 30:03.200]  You know what I mean?
[30:03.200 --> 30:04.920]  Then you got one to kind of work it out.
[30:04.920 --> 30:07.800]  If you could afford more, maybe you got a couple more.
[30:07.800 --> 30:10.240]  But the new folks out there, think about those things, man.
[30:10.240 --> 30:12.520]  These, this stuff is like, it's just easy out here
[30:12.520 --> 30:13.400]  for y'all now.
[30:13.400 --> 30:14.240]  You know what I mean?
[30:14.240 --> 30:16.200]  So definitely take advantage of it, man.
[30:17.040 --> 30:19.320]  And I do, I'm glad the knowledge is there myself.
[30:19.320 --> 30:21.680]  You know, I take advantage of every bit I can
[30:21.680 --> 30:24.840]  and keep learning all I can learn too, man.
[30:24.840 --> 30:27.160]  I think that's key for us.
[30:27.160 --> 30:28.960]  But yeah, thanks to loyalty, man.
[30:28.960 --> 30:29.960]  I love loyalty.
[30:29.960 --> 30:31.400]  He's a guy to stand up.
[30:31.400 --> 30:33.120]  I know I went off in another direction,
[30:33.120 --> 30:35.280]  but appreciate your loyalty.
[30:35.280 --> 30:37.840]  And I can't believe when I was living in Vegas,
[30:37.840 --> 30:39.360]  it never crossed paths, you know?
[30:39.360 --> 30:40.880]  So it's just one of those things, man,
[30:40.880 --> 30:42.160]  the universe is wild.
[30:43.000 --> 30:44.440]  Yeah, he's a good dude.
[30:44.440 --> 30:46.920]  I definitely want to smoke with him one day.
[30:46.920 --> 30:49.680]  And I'm kind of fighting him right now to pay him
[30:49.680 --> 30:51.160]  for some work that he did for me.
[30:51.160 --> 30:52.360]  He just won't take it.
[30:52.360 --> 30:53.880]  So he's like, he's running away.
[30:53.880 --> 30:55.800]  He puts his hands in his pocket and he runs away.
[30:55.800 --> 30:59.080]  So he's a good dude, but I'm gonna get you, brother.
[30:59.960 --> 31:00.880]  We'll figure it out.
[31:00.880 --> 31:02.240]  We'll figure it out.
[31:02.240 --> 31:04.640]  Here's another question that comes up, you know,
[31:04.640 --> 31:06.000]  really frequently.
[31:07.160 --> 31:10.440]  Favorite way to get rid of fungus gnats in organic soil?
[31:12.400 --> 31:13.480]  Rove beetles.
[31:14.520 --> 31:16.720]  Bt, mosquito ducks.
[31:18.320 --> 31:19.520]  That's an easy one.
[31:19.520 --> 31:21.880]  Yeah, those are tried and true with that.
[31:21.880 --> 31:26.080]  It's not a Marco and I's thought process.
[31:26.080 --> 31:29.080]  I mean, you can put rove beetles in there,
[31:29.080 --> 31:31.360]  probably a couple other things and see for yourself
[31:31.360 --> 31:33.920]  how quickly things change.
[31:33.920 --> 31:37.680]  Yeah, the roves get in there and they eat physically,
[31:37.680 --> 31:39.840]  you know, they tear up some larvae and stuff like that.
[31:39.840 --> 31:41.640]  But the Bt's are bacteria.
[31:42.120 --> 31:43.560]  It's the same stuff in mosquito dunks.
[31:43.560 --> 31:46.000]  You wet them, soak them overnight,
[31:46.000 --> 31:49.120]  let the bacteria release.
[31:49.120 --> 31:50.640]  And you can water that into your soil
[31:50.640 --> 31:52.360]  and it'll attack the larvae in the soil
[31:52.360 --> 31:53.520]  and both of those things.
[31:53.520 --> 31:58.520]  Plus a tropical pitcher plant as your passive pest management
[31:59.120 --> 32:01.960]  and you should be straight on fungus gnats.
[32:01.960 --> 32:03.560]  And a caveat with that,
[32:03.560 --> 32:05.840]  when you first started living soil system,
[32:06.720 --> 32:08.960]  probably nine out of 10 times,
[32:08.960 --> 32:10.360]  you're going to have fungus gnats
[32:10.360 --> 32:12.440]  when that first starts to operate.
[32:12.440 --> 32:14.400]  So just, again, be proactive.
[32:14.400 --> 32:15.920]  Again, these are chess moves, right?
[32:15.920 --> 32:16.920]  So if we know that,
[32:16.920 --> 32:20.520]  then we know that we need to get rove beetles in,
[32:20.520 --> 32:22.960]  Bt in as Marco just mentioned,
[32:22.960 --> 32:25.880]  and get those things in a proactive manner.
[32:25.880 --> 32:27.760]  So that once you understand that,
[32:27.760 --> 32:29.840]  you might not ever experience rove beetles,
[32:29.840 --> 32:33.400]  or I'm sorry, fungus gnats by using rove beetles, Bt.
[32:34.880 --> 32:36.880]  I even heard, I don't know,
[32:36.880 --> 32:38.240]  I don't want to speak if this is wrong,
[32:38.240 --> 32:40.800]  but I think the the scutum is also helps
[32:40.800 --> 32:42.640]  with the rove beetles as well.
[32:42.640 --> 32:44.880]  That might be a Matthew Gates question.
[32:45.720 --> 32:48.480]  Yeah, I think that may be right, right?
[32:48.480 --> 32:49.720]  Yeah, I've heard that
[32:49.720 --> 32:51.600]  and I think it was leaving that man's mouth.
[32:51.600 --> 32:52.440]  So yes.
[32:53.920 --> 32:54.760]  And that looks cool.
[32:54.760 --> 32:56.320]  You guys are going to do like an IPM thing.
[32:56.320 --> 32:58.760]  So I just know where all of this is going, man.
[32:58.760 --> 33:02.360]  I mean, these are things that I feel like we were wishing
[33:02.360 --> 33:03.640]  for a long, long time ago
[33:03.640 --> 33:05.840]  and now it's just coming to fruition.
[33:05.840 --> 33:06.680]  It is man.
[33:06.680 --> 33:08.120]  It's a weekly classroom.
[33:09.000 --> 33:09.840]  It's almost like you can enroll.
[33:09.840 --> 33:12.760]  If you discipline yourself and take it seriously,
[33:12.760 --> 33:14.360]  the amount of information you could pull
[33:14.360 --> 33:16.000]  from these episodes.
[33:16.000 --> 33:16.880]  And I imagine, you know,
[33:16.880 --> 33:19.600]  from Matthew Gates episodes as well.
[33:19.600 --> 33:21.040]  Well, he's next level.
[33:21.040 --> 33:22.160]  It's an education.
[33:22.160 --> 33:23.000]  Yes.
[33:23.000 --> 33:26.520]  You know, it's not a bunch of stoners sitting around, man.
[33:26.520 --> 33:27.680]  It's different now, baby.
[33:27.680 --> 33:29.280]  We got professional people.
[33:29.280 --> 33:33.080]  We got people who their regular life is professional
[33:33.080 --> 33:35.120]  and then they do this professionally
[33:35.120 --> 33:37.440]  or they only do this, but we're all professionals.
[33:38.200 --> 33:39.280]  And let me just jump in
[33:39.280 --> 33:41.880]  because I thought about something, industry standards.
[33:41.880 --> 33:43.680]  You know, one of my buddies posted something
[33:43.680 --> 33:47.080]  and this is, I think by now everyone's cutting
[33:47.080 --> 33:49.160]  and hanging dry, trimming dry.
[33:49.160 --> 33:51.440]  I think that's very established.
[33:52.480 --> 33:53.720]  And I think that should be something
[33:53.720 --> 33:55.640]  like an industry standard, you know?
[33:55.640 --> 33:58.320]  Like, you know, I haven't put a lot of thought into it.
[33:58.320 --> 33:59.680]  It just kind of came to my mind,
[33:59.680 --> 34:01.240]  but like what other kinds of things
[34:01.240 --> 34:04.040]  like do we think should be like fully agreed
[34:04.040 --> 34:05.200]  upon in the community?
[34:05.240 --> 34:07.760]  Are there many things or is it kind of,
[34:07.760 --> 34:10.000]  I haven't really thought about it, you know what I mean?
[34:10.000 --> 34:13.400]  Man, I'm gonna say testing standards
[34:13.400 --> 34:16.720]  because labs all across the country, all across the state,
[34:16.720 --> 34:20.200]  there is no one particular standard
[34:20.200 --> 34:21.600]  that they're using to test.
[34:21.600 --> 34:24.480]  Like if you were testing any other element,
[34:24.480 --> 34:27.760]  like say testing copper, every testing lab
[34:27.760 --> 34:31.360]  can order the same standard to put into their machine
[34:31.360 --> 34:33.480]  that calibrates it.
[34:33.840 --> 34:36.520]  You get, you know, similar unanimous results.
[34:36.520 --> 34:39.720]  That to me is a big issue.
[34:39.720 --> 34:41.840]  I've even seen people in this state
[34:41.840 --> 34:43.960]  keef their buds before they sent it in
[34:43.960 --> 34:45.880]  because unfortunately retail market,
[34:45.880 --> 34:47.600]  a lot of times it's about numbers.
[34:49.840 --> 34:51.600]  I can believe that.
[34:51.600 --> 34:55.240]  Yeah, I don't know how you get around it,
[34:55.240 --> 35:00.240]  but to transparency, we need some sort of testing standard.
[35:01.320 --> 35:02.240]  I agree, Chad.
[35:02.240 --> 35:04.560]  And that's one thing that's annoying.
[35:04.560 --> 35:06.280]  Well, you know what, it's not annoying.
[35:06.280 --> 35:09.120]  That's why I don't really look at the THC numbers.
[35:09.120 --> 35:10.880]  I look at them with a grain of salt.
[35:10.880 --> 35:14.200]  Like if I go shopping, you know, I'm out of town,
[35:14.200 --> 35:15.720]  I look at that with a grain of salt.
[35:15.720 --> 35:19.000]  I try to find out more about who that grower was
[35:19.000 --> 35:21.440]  and the methods, you know, the kind that was grown under,
[35:21.440 --> 35:24.240]  because like you said, man, if I got a test lab
[35:24.240 --> 35:29.160]  and always my stuff is 2% higher than the other guy's lab,
[35:29.160 --> 35:31.280]  you know, I'm gonna become a popular lab.
[35:31.280 --> 35:33.160]  You know what I mean?
[35:33.160 --> 35:35.080]  So like, those are the kinds of things I think,
[35:35.080 --> 35:37.800]  you're right, man, that we need to cut some of the bullshit
[35:37.800 --> 35:40.200]  out of the game somehow, some way.
[35:41.560 --> 35:42.480]  Do I have the answer?
[35:42.480 --> 35:45.880]  No, but maybe, you know, you get a, you know,
[35:45.880 --> 35:47.800]  if you show me one test, well, show me two,
[35:47.800 --> 35:49.600]  show me one from a different place, you know,
[35:49.600 --> 35:50.800]  let's kind of do it like that.
[35:50.800 --> 35:53.080]  So yeah, I agree that testing
[35:53.080 --> 35:54.960]  should definitely be standardized.
[35:55.960 --> 35:57.160]  Yeah, I second that.
[35:57.160 --> 36:00.000]  I mean, there's just way too many,
[36:00.000 --> 36:02.880]  especially just even a few years ago,
[36:02.880 --> 36:04.160]  there were people that were saying like,
[36:04.160 --> 36:05.680]  oh, you know, if you use this one lab,
[36:05.680 --> 36:07.720]  I guess they don't clean the equipment
[36:07.720 --> 36:08.960]  the way that they should.
[36:08.960 --> 36:11.280]  And so if you sent them the sample at like,
[36:11.280 --> 36:13.160]  say like one o'clock or two o'clock,
[36:13.160 --> 36:15.760]  I guess it had THC residue on it.
[36:15.760 --> 36:19.160]  So if you were testing later in the afternoon,
[36:19.160 --> 36:21.560]  you would get a higher test just based on that.
[36:21.560 --> 36:22.680]  And just like you had mentioned,
[36:22.680 --> 36:24.400]  two, three percentage points and boom,
[36:24.400 --> 36:26.400]  your stuff looks way better on the show.
[36:27.880 --> 36:28.880]  Yeah, definitely.
[36:28.880 --> 36:32.600]  Shout out to the labs that were saying 40, 45% in Oklahoma.
[36:33.800 --> 36:35.320]  Oh, they were doing that?
[36:35.320 --> 36:36.160]  Yeah, they were.
[36:36.160 --> 36:38.600]  It was on the labels, 40%.
[36:38.600 --> 36:39.920]  I'm like, wow, these,
[36:39.920 --> 36:42.880]  you guys must be like the greatest of all time.
[36:42.880 --> 36:46.080]  Yeah, again, that means the bud in your hand,
[36:46.080 --> 36:50.200]  40% of the weight is THC.
[36:50.200 --> 36:52.560]  Which is trichomes, basically.
[36:52.560 --> 36:56.480]  Yeah, just do the reality math in your head there.
[36:56.480 --> 36:57.920]  Exactly.
[36:57.920 --> 37:00.760]  But speaking of trichomes, we got an interesting one.
[37:00.760 --> 37:04.520]  I've seen a couple pictures online,
[37:04.520 --> 37:06.920]  but this gentleman, I'm assuming gentlemen,
[37:06.920 --> 37:09.600]  Mr. Lincoln, okay, safe assumption there, we'll hope.
[37:10.920 --> 37:14.560]  He's talking about a strain that he has been growing,
[37:14.560 --> 37:19.400]  but instead of amber heads, they're turning blue.
[37:19.400 --> 37:24.000]  Is this like maybe a mutation of anthocyanins
[37:24.000 --> 37:26.240]  not fully reaching their potential?
[37:26.240 --> 37:29.240]  Or have you guys ever seen that?
[37:29.240 --> 37:30.520]  And here's kind of the second part.
[37:30.520 --> 37:34.200]  The stigmas would brown up as it matures.
[37:34.200 --> 37:37.920]  They appear blue, the trichomes, fucking blue, man.
[37:37.920 --> 37:39.280]  I don't know if you guys have ever seen that,
[37:39.280 --> 37:41.520]  but that would make some interesting concentrate, right?
[37:41.520 --> 37:44.080]  Yeah, send it all to me, man, it's trash.
[37:44.080 --> 37:44.920]  You don't need it.
[37:44.920 --> 37:47.640]  No, I have seen, they're making some THC diamonds
[37:47.640 --> 37:51.400]  that are blue, and I have no idea how they're doing that.
[37:51.400 --> 37:53.920]  So maybe they have genetics that we don't know about,
[37:53.960 --> 37:57.400]  but I've personally never seen that.
[37:57.400 --> 37:59.520]  I know there's certain things that I've always wanted,
[37:59.520 --> 38:01.520]  like a plant with pink pistils,
[38:01.520 --> 38:04.200]  that's difficult to kind of find.
[38:04.200 --> 38:07.040]  I mean, that'd be pretty dope if this is something,
[38:07.040 --> 38:08.240]  I'd like to see a picture of it
[38:08.240 --> 38:11.600]  and know a little bit more about the strain or something.
[38:11.600 --> 38:12.800]  Do you wanna see pink pistils?
[38:12.800 --> 38:14.440]  Check out Green Source Gardens.
[38:14.440 --> 38:16.920]  They are on another level matching eggs.
[38:16.920 --> 38:18.680]  Are they outdoors or indoors?
[38:18.680 --> 38:19.520]  Outdoors.
[38:19.520 --> 38:21.960]  Okay, I've only really seen the pink pistil
[38:21.960 --> 38:23.440]  show up outdoors.
[38:23.800 --> 38:24.640]  Sunlight.
[38:24.640 --> 38:26.840]  I mean, how the hell are you gonna compete with sunlight?
[38:26.840 --> 38:29.040]  And anybody that's talking about indoor,
[38:29.040 --> 38:31.520]  their LEDs are almost to the sun.
[38:31.520 --> 38:33.280]  That's when my ears flap over.
[38:33.280 --> 38:35.880]  Now you're just trying to sell me on some bullshit.
[38:35.880 --> 38:38.160]  Nothing's going to compete against the sun.
[38:38.160 --> 38:40.360]  With the LED, you're just trying to get the best
[38:40.360 --> 38:42.680]  you can get, the best technology,
[38:42.680 --> 38:44.320]  the best that's gonna bring out the best
[38:44.320 --> 38:45.640]  of what you can do indoors.
[38:45.640 --> 38:47.000]  That's all you can really do.
[38:47.000 --> 38:48.880]  But yeah, man, the sun,
[38:48.880 --> 38:50.400]  you could never say better than the sun,
[38:50.400 --> 38:51.640]  but people argue that shit.
[38:51.640 --> 38:52.920]  Like, they'll really,
[38:53.040 --> 38:54.840]  some people feel that wholeheartedly.
[38:55.760 --> 38:56.960]  I feel differently.
[38:58.240 --> 39:00.200]  And that makes me wonder too, Mr. Lincoln,
[39:00.200 --> 39:01.880]  if you are indoors or outdoors.
[39:01.880 --> 39:05.160]  I wonder if it is that special UV
[39:05.160 --> 39:06.680]  that we're getting from outside.
[39:06.680 --> 39:10.880]  So I'll keep my eye open in chat for your response there.
[39:12.320 --> 39:14.640]  I know bog seeds, the blue moon rocks,
[39:14.640 --> 39:16.040]  I used to love to rock that stuff.
[39:16.040 --> 39:17.920]  Supposedly people had found genetics
[39:17.920 --> 39:18.960]  that were kind of like that,
[39:18.960 --> 39:20.480]  but I personally never saw it.
[39:20.600 --> 39:21.440]  Mm-hmm.
[39:23.720 --> 39:25.040]  And here's kind of a follow-up
[39:25.040 --> 39:27.080]  to the microbe question earlier.
[39:27.080 --> 39:29.880]  It says, does collapse mean just the shifts
[39:29.880 --> 39:31.640]  of microbes away from being balanced?
[39:31.640 --> 39:33.760]  Again, Marco, you kind of mentioned like dominant
[39:33.760 --> 39:35.920]  versus happy balance,
[39:35.920 --> 39:39.800]  or is this just like total collapse of life going on?
[39:39.800 --> 39:41.480]  No, you're never gonna collapse,
[39:41.480 --> 39:42.640]  total collapse of life.
[39:42.640 --> 39:43.480]  It's never gonna,
[39:43.480 --> 39:45.400]  the only thing that can do that is like,
[39:45.400 --> 39:49.480]  I say, salt or chemical or something to kill.
[39:49.480 --> 39:51.280]  It takes a lot to just collapse a life.
[39:51.280 --> 39:55.520]  Now you might end up with just a few types of microbes.
[39:55.520 --> 39:59.600]  Just, I had an example, I think it was last year.
[39:59.600 --> 40:00.920]  I was checking, I was doing,
[40:00.920 --> 40:04.320]  I was testing JLFs, which are the dominant for fertilizer,
[40:04.320 --> 40:08.440]  plant material, water, and microbes in a bucket or barrel.
[40:09.400 --> 40:11.120]  So I had one that was really old.
[40:11.120 --> 40:14.140]  I hadn't added any new plant material to it.
[40:14.140 --> 40:16.000]  And when I looked at that,
[40:16.000 --> 40:20.160]  there was only literally like one type of microbe in there.
[40:20.160 --> 40:21.600]  And it was a type of flagellate.
[40:21.600 --> 40:23.720]  It was a larger microbe.
[40:23.720 --> 40:28.720]  And my assumption was that all of the food
[40:28.760 --> 40:30.960]  in the JLF barrel had been consumed.
[40:30.960 --> 40:33.640]  And now this larger microbe had then in turn
[40:33.640 --> 40:35.560]  consumed all the other microbes.
[40:35.560 --> 40:37.080]  Because when you looked at this slide,
[40:37.080 --> 40:38.960]  it was literally just this one big guy
[40:38.960 --> 40:40.520]  just randomly swimming around.
[40:40.520 --> 40:45.220]  So you can definitely collapse microbes to a very low,
[40:45.220 --> 40:46.800]  but think about it, wait a minute.
[40:46.800 --> 40:48.460]  Even though there's that one,
[40:48.460 --> 40:50.660]  I saw about 50 of them in a drop.
[40:50.660 --> 40:52.100]  So think about it.
[40:52.100 --> 40:54.020]  You may call that a collapse,
[40:54.020 --> 40:56.420]  but there's still so much life in that,
[40:56.420 --> 40:58.260]  but it's just not diverse anymore.
[40:58.260 --> 41:00.360]  So what happens is you lose the diversity.
[41:02.140 --> 41:03.980]  Well said, that's exactly what happens.
[41:03.980 --> 41:05.180]  You lose the diversity
[41:05.180 --> 41:06.620]  and then you're gonna have a lot of issues.
[41:06.620 --> 41:08.020]  So that's kind of where we're getting.
[41:08.020 --> 41:09.820]  And I feel like the only time you're shooting yourself
[41:09.820 --> 41:10.900]  in the foot, like we had mentioned,
[41:10.900 --> 41:13.340]  is when you're making those compost teas
[41:13.340 --> 41:14.840]  and doing it incorrectly.
[41:15.460 --> 41:17.720]  Otherwise, it'd be pretty hard to screw that up.
[41:17.720 --> 41:20.440]  It's almost like you'd have to kind of go out of your way,
[41:20.440 --> 41:23.280]  add a bunch of pH up, pH down, or salt,
[41:23.280 --> 41:25.400]  or something like that that's kind of unconventional
[41:25.400 --> 41:28.680]  that you're kind of just maybe grasping straws at.
[41:28.680 --> 41:31.120]  But again, this is a long-term play.
[41:31.120 --> 41:34.900]  These are thinking person's viewpoints.
[41:34.900 --> 41:37.540]  And so diversity, diversity, diversity.
[41:37.540 --> 41:39.840]  If you focus on that and focus on feeding the soil,
[41:39.840 --> 41:43.220]  not the plant, you're not gonna have any of those issues.
[41:43.220 --> 41:46.580]  And let me, before you jump, Chad, one more, please.
[41:46.580 --> 41:50.060]  Another thing, I've had some people reach out to me
[41:50.060 --> 41:52.780]  and they've screwed up their biology
[41:52.780 --> 41:56.780]  in their soil pretty badly by over sugaring.
[41:56.780 --> 41:59.780]  The over application of sugary inputs
[41:59.780 --> 42:01.820]  can throw the balance off in your soil.
[42:01.820 --> 42:04.740]  If you think about it, sugar has lots of energy.
[42:04.740 --> 42:06.900]  A microbe is very small.
[42:06.900 --> 42:10.180]  It takes a lot for that microbe to be able to eat,
[42:10.180 --> 42:12.920]  think of a piece of sugar compared to a microbe.
[42:13.620 --> 42:14.920]  And so the amounts of sugar you put in your soil
[42:14.920 --> 42:15.880]  can be detrimental.
[42:15.880 --> 42:17.780]  There are some people out there which,
[42:18.640 --> 42:19.840]  I'm not gonna get into that right now,
[42:19.840 --> 42:21.520]  but just watch the amount of things
[42:21.520 --> 42:24.320]  you are putting into your living soils.
[42:25.440 --> 42:27.360]  You know, you can cause issues like that.
[42:27.360 --> 42:31.080]  And I've personally seen a thriving living soil system
[42:31.080 --> 42:32.660]  when you add a bunch of different sugars,
[42:32.660 --> 42:36.160]  now all of a sudden you do have fungus gnats again.
[42:36.160 --> 42:40.040]  You have thrips, sometimes even spider mites, russet mites,
[42:40.040 --> 42:41.400]  just a variety of different things
[42:41.400 --> 42:45.320]  that seem to come in somehow or start to show themselves
[42:45.320 --> 42:47.200]  when you do go heavy on the sugars.
[42:48.160 --> 42:50.000]  Yeah, I think it's just the balance, Brian.
[42:50.000 --> 42:52.640]  I think you get out of balance, you know what I mean?
[42:52.640 --> 42:54.000]  And then when you're out of balance,
[42:54.000 --> 42:57.080]  now those predators, those guys we don't like,
[42:57.080 --> 42:59.000]  come on in, the door's open.
[42:59.000 --> 43:01.480]  When it's balanced, it's big, healthy, robust,
[43:01.480 --> 43:04.320]  it's like a thriving, strong city.
[43:04.320 --> 43:07.360]  Like it's hard to just jump in a city and make your way.
[43:07.360 --> 43:08.200]  You know what I mean?
[43:08.200 --> 43:09.760]  Like if you think of the microbial community,
[43:09.800 --> 43:13.360]  the diversity is really what makes it so strong.
[43:14.640 --> 43:16.480]  And remember the good microbes wanna work
[43:16.480 --> 43:18.560]  in a symbiotic relationship with each other.
[43:18.560 --> 43:20.240]  So if they're alive and healthy,
[43:20.240 --> 43:22.280]  it's gonna be really hard for the quote unquote,
[43:22.280 --> 43:24.200]  bad microbes to even develop
[43:24.200 --> 43:27.280]  because they're spread out somewhere around the rhizosphere.
[43:27.280 --> 43:28.720]  It's gonna be really hard for them.
[43:28.720 --> 43:31.640]  They wanna work together where the alpha microbes,
[43:31.640 --> 43:34.160]  the bad microbes that wanna come in and take over,
[43:34.160 --> 43:36.200]  that's how, at least it was explained to me,
[43:36.200 --> 43:39.200]  that's how the good microbes supersede the bad microbes
[43:39.640 --> 43:43.840]  is because they're working in a symbiotic harmonious way.
[43:43.840 --> 43:46.920]  And again, just don't disturb that,
[43:46.920 --> 43:48.920]  continue to feed that diversity
[43:48.920 --> 43:50.960]  and they will take care of it themselves.
[43:52.640 --> 43:56.000]  Would you say solutions like molasses
[43:56.000 --> 43:58.280]  is one of those culprits that may add a little bit
[43:58.280 --> 44:00.520]  too much sugar into your system?
[44:00.520 --> 44:03.040]  Yeah, and we always added way too much.
[44:03.040 --> 44:05.200]  So if you're still on the,
[44:05.200 --> 44:06.840]  I think like Marco had mentioned,
[44:07.280 --> 44:10.560]  on the forums, it was really only unsulfured
[44:10.560 --> 44:11.600]  blackstrap molasses.
[44:11.600 --> 44:13.160]  That was like the be all end all
[44:13.160 --> 44:15.520]  for probably a few years there.
[44:15.520 --> 44:18.560]  And now that a lot more brighter minds are coming out
[44:18.560 --> 44:21.240]  and saying like, all right, use all these different sugars.
[44:21.240 --> 44:23.400]  There's a variety of different inputs
[44:23.400 --> 44:25.000]  and stuff like that that you can use.
[44:25.000 --> 44:26.960]  Again, it's the diversity that you wanna use.
[44:26.960 --> 44:30.800]  So just use a little bit of those different sugars
[44:30.800 --> 44:32.760]  and you're gonna see health.
[44:32.760 --> 44:35.600]  If you go overboard, if you're constantly thinking like,
[44:35.600 --> 44:38.440]  I need to add things to improve my living soil system.
[44:38.440 --> 44:41.040]  That's again, where you're gonna shoot yourself in the foot.
[44:42.040 --> 44:42.880]  Yeah.
[44:44.240 --> 44:46.960]  Less is more a lot of times.
[44:46.960 --> 44:49.600]  And then the less is more, it's funny you say that
[44:49.600 --> 44:52.320]  from the man that brought more on to my attention,
[44:52.320 --> 44:56.080]  the man who loves his sand, silt and clay, Layton Morrison.
[44:56.080 --> 44:57.840]  It's a question for you though, Brian.
[44:57.840 --> 45:00.760]  Do you use sand, silt and clay?
[45:01.640 --> 45:03.560]  So I haven't been farming since Layton
[45:03.560 --> 45:05.960]  and I started doing the show.
[45:05.960 --> 45:07.560]  So I personally haven't done that,
[45:07.560 --> 45:09.720]  but to the right of me right here,
[45:09.720 --> 45:12.160]  I have my bearded dragon cage.
[45:12.160 --> 45:14.640]  Just got in my new house and everything.
[45:14.640 --> 45:17.320]  And so I plan to use that and maybe I'll even make
[45:17.320 --> 45:19.560]  like a little video or something when I make that.
[45:19.560 --> 45:22.560]  But I do plan to do that for my bearded dragon
[45:22.560 --> 45:25.360]  in the aquarium, terrarium.
[45:25.360 --> 45:28.280]  And then, you know, in time,
[45:28.280 --> 45:32.640]  I hope to have enough money to buy a ranch here in Colorado.
[45:32.640 --> 45:34.480]  And once that time comes,
[45:34.480 --> 45:37.720]  best believe that I'm going to farm in that manner.
[45:37.720 --> 45:40.560]  And hopefully I'll be able to farm outdoors.
[45:42.160 --> 45:45.440]  And I guess that easily could apply to you as well, Marco.
[45:45.440 --> 45:49.120]  I know you have a lot of systems going on your property.
[45:49.120 --> 45:51.640]  Is sand, silt and clay one of those?
[45:51.640 --> 45:53.520]  Yeah, yes, definitely one.
[45:53.520 --> 45:54.760]  Part of the horizontal.
[45:54.760 --> 45:57.680]  I like to go to the river, get the sand and silt.
[45:57.680 --> 46:00.440]  And I got, we get red clay here
[46:00.440 --> 46:02.880]  brought by fancy red clays.
[46:02.880 --> 46:03.720]  But yeah, I do.
[46:03.720 --> 46:06.680]  It's, you know, it's like a hybrid approach, man.
[46:06.680 --> 46:07.720]  It's like anything else.
[46:07.720 --> 46:10.720]  Like, you know, you start out, you just call it soilless
[46:10.720 --> 46:12.200]  and it is so soilless in a way,
[46:12.200 --> 46:14.840]  but then I kind of started adding clays back to that.
[46:14.840 --> 46:15.680]  You know what I mean?
[46:15.680 --> 46:16.520]  But then I started to say,
[46:16.520 --> 46:18.040]  well, let me just throw a little sand in there
[46:18.040 --> 46:20.200]  to give me a little bit of, you know,
[46:20.200 --> 46:22.480]  more coarse texture to my soil.
[46:22.480 --> 46:25.800]  So, you know, a lot of this stuff we do
[46:25.800 --> 46:27.920]  is not like a hundred percent concrete.
[46:27.920 --> 46:30.400]  It's kind of more like me as the farmer,
[46:30.400 --> 46:32.840]  Brian as the farmer, Chad as the farmer,
[46:32.840 --> 46:35.480]  you have to kind of work the way
[46:35.480 --> 46:37.920]  it works best within your system.
[46:37.920 --> 46:39.000]  You know what I mean?
[46:39.000 --> 46:41.000]  If that makes a lot of sense.
[46:41.000 --> 46:44.880]  Find good people to follow, to start out as their guidance.
[46:44.880 --> 46:49.000]  But as you go, as long as you keep the principles,
[46:49.000 --> 46:51.600]  you know, the principles of natural farming,
[46:51.600 --> 46:53.640]  such as like all things are good
[46:53.640 --> 46:55.200]  when things are in balance, you know,
[46:55.200 --> 46:56.800]  good and bad are the same.
[46:56.800 --> 46:58.600]  You know, those kinds of principles,
[47:00.040 --> 47:02.040]  then I think there's a lot of flexibility
[47:02.040 --> 47:04.360]  for you just to be the master of your garden and say,
[47:04.360 --> 47:06.600]  okay, well, yes, I do use sand, silt and clay,
[47:06.600 --> 47:09.160]  but I use a small percentage and this is how I use it.
[47:09.160 --> 47:10.600]  And, or no, I don't.
[47:10.600 --> 47:14.800]  And either method can grow a fine product,
[47:14.800 --> 47:18.520]  but you have to provide inputs accordingly.
[47:18.520 --> 47:19.520]  You know what I mean?
[47:19.520 --> 47:22.640]  Like for me, my soil is fairly lightly amended.
[47:23.520 --> 47:26.480]  So, and I do that because I make all these inputs.
[47:27.160 --> 47:29.440]  I make, you know, dozens of inputs and I want to use them.
[47:29.440 --> 47:32.240]  Like I want to use all these things.
[47:32.240 --> 47:34.800]  So when I water, I might use eight different inputs.
[47:34.800 --> 47:36.840]  And the reason I do that,
[47:36.840 --> 47:39.960]  I take the strength out of my soil
[47:39.960 --> 47:43.760]  and I kind of build it in as my plants are growing.
[47:43.760 --> 47:45.680]  I feel like when I add the inputs,
[47:45.680 --> 47:49.360]  it's not making the plant take from the soil.
[47:49.360 --> 47:52.760]  It's kind of letting what's in the soil keep being cycled.
[47:52.760 --> 47:55.920]  And then the plant can kind of take what I'm giving it.
[47:56.360 --> 47:58.560]  And it's, like I said, it's hard to kind of explain.
[47:58.560 --> 47:59.960]  Everybody has their own methods,
[47:59.960 --> 48:01.600]  but that's kind of a little bit of how,
[48:01.600 --> 48:03.720]  you know, my thought process.
[48:03.720 --> 48:05.480]  Well, that's kind of what this show is about too,
[48:05.480 --> 48:09.000]  is we want you, or we're trying to teach you to think,
[48:09.000 --> 48:10.960]  and then you take your skill sets
[48:10.960 --> 48:14.040]  wherever you're at at that time and apply that.
[48:14.040 --> 48:17.240]  And I think if we were just saying like,
[48:17.240 --> 48:18.800]  all right, A, B, C, you do this,
[48:18.800 --> 48:20.800]  there would be so many people that were failing
[48:20.800 --> 48:22.240]  that I would, you know,
[48:22.240 --> 48:24.160]  I would feel bad about that kind of stuff.
[48:24.200 --> 48:25.840]  So I think that's why we go out of our way
[48:25.840 --> 48:27.080]  to kind of allow you guys,
[48:27.080 --> 48:29.320]  and we interview so many different people,
[48:29.320 --> 48:30.960]  so many thought processes.
[48:30.960 --> 48:32.520]  I'll tell you guys right now,
[48:32.520 --> 48:34.920]  sometimes some of the guests, some of the things they say,
[48:34.920 --> 48:36.920]  I personally don't even agree with that.
[48:36.920 --> 48:38.760]  But that doesn't mean that I don't want you guys
[48:38.760 --> 48:39.680]  to hear that.
[48:39.680 --> 48:42.840]  I want you guys to be able to hear a variety of information
[48:42.840 --> 48:45.560]  and then you pick and choose what you wanna run with,
[48:45.560 --> 48:48.440]  because I feel like that's the best way as an educator.
[48:48.440 --> 48:51.120]  If I'm pigeonholing, if Marco's pigeonholing,
[48:51.120 --> 48:53.680]  Chad's pigeonholing the viewership,
[48:54.200 --> 48:55.280]  then I feel like we're almost,
[48:55.280 --> 48:57.200]  again, we're getting more to like a cultish thing
[48:57.200 --> 48:59.000]  where if you don't believe what we're saying,
[48:59.000 --> 49:00.560]  then the hell with you.
[49:00.560 --> 49:03.920]  And that's the last thing I would wanna see as an educator.
[49:03.920 --> 49:05.480]  Yeah.
[49:05.480 --> 49:07.320]  Critical thinking is so important
[49:07.320 --> 49:11.800]  because it also relates into your growing in the garden.
[49:11.800 --> 49:14.480]  You see something that looks like a deficiency,
[49:14.480 --> 49:17.120]  and if you just narrow minded, simple, it's a deficiency,
[49:17.120 --> 49:18.480]  that's how you approach it.
[49:18.480 --> 49:19.840]  But if you critically look at it,
[49:19.840 --> 49:21.240]  you look at the other conditions
[49:21.240 --> 49:23.240]  that could cause something like a lockout
[49:23.800 --> 49:25.440]  or any of the other variables.
[49:25.440 --> 49:28.040]  So yeah, critical thinking.
[49:28.040 --> 49:29.320]  Don't just take the A and B.
[49:29.320 --> 49:31.040]  Critical thinking is huge.
[49:31.040 --> 49:32.720]  And the first time I got Russet mites,
[49:32.720 --> 49:34.160]  I thought it was deficiency.
[49:34.160 --> 49:35.360]  We're trying to figure things out,
[49:35.360 --> 49:37.200]  adding a bunch of inputs.
[49:37.200 --> 49:39.240]  You know, a week, probably a week and a half goes by
[49:39.240 --> 49:41.320]  and we lose the entire flip.
[49:41.320 --> 49:44.560]  So again, you need to, maybe if it is a deficiency,
[49:44.560 --> 49:46.800]  you also need to kind of double check a few other things
[49:46.800 --> 49:48.600]  before you make your decision on,
[49:48.600 --> 49:50.040]  yes, this is a deficiency,
[49:50.080 --> 49:53.320]  because if you're having some kind of pest issue
[49:53.320 --> 49:56.240]  for some of the pests, it can also look like a deficiency.
[49:57.240 --> 49:59.040]  Man, well said.
[49:59.040 --> 50:01.000]  One more note on that one, please.
[50:01.000 --> 50:02.560]  This just happened this week.
[50:03.560 --> 50:07.240]  I had some soil shredders that were chewing on my stalk.
[50:07.240 --> 50:10.160]  If y'all follow my Instagram, some of y'all saw that.
[50:10.160 --> 50:12.160]  The stalk of my plant.
[50:12.160 --> 50:15.800]  That actually made that plant look deficient
[50:15.800 --> 50:17.840]  because it was struggling at that stalk.
[50:17.840 --> 50:19.480]  It almost girdled it where it was like,
[50:20.120 --> 50:23.080]  took half the outer bark off.
[50:23.080 --> 50:25.560]  And it was making that plant look deficient.
[50:25.560 --> 50:28.520]  It was giving me those wilty leaves even after watering
[50:28.520 --> 50:30.440]  and I couldn't figure it out.
[50:30.440 --> 50:33.880]  And then, so I finally, I saw the stalk.
[50:33.880 --> 50:35.240]  I was actually showing my dad.
[50:35.240 --> 50:36.920]  I was like, dad, look how thick that stalk is.
[50:36.920 --> 50:41.120]  He's like, what's that, a roly poly down there on it?
[50:41.120 --> 50:44.160]  So I said, I dug down in there and look.
[50:44.160 --> 50:46.360]  Well, goddammit, yes it is, dad.
[50:46.360 --> 50:48.880]  There's three roly polies eating my stem.
[50:49.280 --> 50:50.120]  Thank you.
[50:50.120 --> 50:52.080]  So I immediately jumped into action.
[50:52.080 --> 50:56.200]  So being observant, man, just sitting there
[50:56.200 --> 50:57.800]  and watching your plants.
[50:57.800 --> 51:01.240]  And I always ask myself, is that supposed to be there?
[51:03.120 --> 51:05.680]  Is that black spot supposed to be on a leaf?
[51:05.680 --> 51:06.520]  What is that?
[51:06.520 --> 51:09.480]  And look up the chain, look up.
[51:09.480 --> 51:12.440]  Is it a caterpillar pooping on your leaves or what is it?
[51:12.440 --> 51:14.640]  Kind of be observant.
[51:14.640 --> 51:17.480]  A plant leaf should pretty much be green.
[51:17.480 --> 51:20.120]  And if it's not, do a little critical thinking,
[51:20.120 --> 51:22.960]  try to maybe figure out what you got going on.
[51:25.640 --> 51:27.600]  I guess from my side of things, I would say,
[51:27.600 --> 51:31.720]  go out of your way to buy higher end roly polies
[51:31.720 --> 51:33.240]  if you wanna farm with roly polies.
[51:33.240 --> 51:34.960]  Cause the gray ones are baloney
[51:34.960 --> 51:36.840]  and fuck up your grow hardcore.
[51:38.560 --> 51:42.240]  Yeah, the indigenous ones can be little assholes for sure.
[51:42.240 --> 51:44.200]  No baloney, no baloney.
[51:44.200 --> 51:47.800]  Now here's something that I've never really crossed
[51:47.800 --> 51:52.800]  my mind to talk about the use of CO2.
[51:52.920 --> 51:57.080]  Is the use of CO2 as common in an indoor living soil
[51:57.080 --> 52:00.440]  as it would be in a synthetic indoor?
[52:00.440 --> 52:04.320]  And would the additional CO2 do anything
[52:04.320 --> 52:06.360]  to the soil or microbial life?
[52:06.360 --> 52:08.320]  And I realized that might be a silly question,
[52:08.320 --> 52:11.560]  but I've never put those words together in my head before.
[52:11.880 --> 52:13.880]  I like that, it makes sense.
[52:13.880 --> 52:14.720]  You know what, man?
[52:14.720 --> 52:19.000]  I remember CO2 was as much more prevalent
[52:19.000 --> 52:20.440]  to the home grower at one point
[52:20.440 --> 52:23.300]  where people seemed like they were trying it more.
[52:24.760 --> 52:27.200]  I've gone years and not done it.
[52:27.200 --> 52:30.200]  I literally just, I had a natural gas burner, man.
[52:30.200 --> 52:32.080]  I bought this thing like five years ago,
[52:32.080 --> 52:33.000]  never hooked it up.
[52:33.000 --> 52:35.240]  And literally just now that I've gotten
[52:35.240 --> 52:37.560]  the new lighting technology is cranked up
[52:37.560 --> 52:40.360]  and I'm able to like hit such high PAR numbers
[52:40.360 --> 52:43.680]  that I'm gonna introduce this natural gas burner
[52:43.680 --> 52:46.240]  into my small grow.
[52:46.240 --> 52:48.880]  I don't have any fear for the microbes.
[52:48.880 --> 52:53.640]  The parts per million, you wanna match your light intensity.
[52:53.640 --> 52:56.760]  I'm probably thinking around maybe 1500
[52:56.760 --> 52:58.760]  and then running my light, I think I can-
[52:58.760 --> 53:00.560]  And that would be max by the way.
[53:00.560 --> 53:01.600]  Yeah, like max.
[53:01.600 --> 53:05.960]  Like 1250, you gain a nice jump in CO2.
[53:05.960 --> 53:10.200]  I think normal's anywhere from 700 to a thousand
[53:10.200 --> 53:13.720]  in a living space at their house.
[53:13.720 --> 53:16.120]  So like even jumping to 1250 or something,
[53:16.120 --> 53:18.160]  I think it's a huge gain, Chad.
[53:18.160 --> 53:20.600]  I don't think it'd be a detriment to the soil microbes.
[53:20.600 --> 53:21.840]  I'm gonna find out.
[53:21.840 --> 53:22.680]  Okay.
[53:22.680 --> 53:24.280]  And the commercial facilities,
[53:24.280 --> 53:27.440]  I think CO2 is the last thing that you,
[53:27.440 --> 53:29.400]  that's the cherry on the top, right?
[53:29.400 --> 53:31.200]  So if you have everything dialed in,
[53:31.200 --> 53:32.240]  your environment's dialed in,
[53:32.240 --> 53:34.080]  your IPM protocols are on point,
[53:34.080 --> 53:39.080]  your entire team is scoping and finding small issues.
[53:39.120 --> 53:41.200]  That's when I would add CO2.
[53:41.200 --> 53:43.240]  I feel like until then,
[53:43.240 --> 53:45.200]  you're kind of just spending a lot of money.
[53:45.200 --> 53:47.040]  I know in the larger commercial facilities
[53:47.040 --> 53:48.920]  that I worked at here in Colorado,
[53:48.920 --> 53:51.600]  they were spending thousands of dollars a month
[53:51.600 --> 53:52.720]  in all these different rooms
[53:52.720 --> 53:56.000]  when we had pest problems and all these other things
[53:56.000 --> 53:58.280]  that it just didn't seem like it was worth it.
[53:58.280 --> 54:02.280]  So my advice to you is to focus on CO2.
[54:03.280 --> 54:06.000]  If I was a home grower, 1,500 would,
[54:06.960 --> 54:10.480]  there might be, especially if it's like a smaller tent,
[54:10.480 --> 54:13.640]  that might be a little dangerous for some people.
[54:13.640 --> 54:15.920]  But in a larger facility,
[54:15.920 --> 54:17.680]  you could probably run it up to 15.
[54:17.680 --> 54:19.560]  That would be seriously the max.
[54:19.560 --> 54:21.600]  I would probably start out at like a thousand
[54:21.600 --> 54:23.640]  and then kind of see how the plants respond.
[54:23.640 --> 54:26.720]  How do you feel when you walk into the room?
[54:26.720 --> 54:27.680]  Does your head hurt?
[54:27.680 --> 54:29.000]  Do you feel lightheaded?
[54:29.000 --> 54:31.280]  Then you got too much CO2 in your room.
[54:31.320 --> 54:33.480]  Yeah, and I'm gonna run it only,
[54:33.480 --> 54:34.760]  definitely don't go in the room
[54:34.760 --> 54:36.720]  when you're running high CO2.
[54:36.720 --> 54:38.360]  It's, yeah, definitely not.
[54:38.360 --> 54:40.440]  And I'm gonna play around with some timing of it
[54:40.440 --> 54:43.360]  and how many hours a day and that kind of stuff.
[54:43.360 --> 54:46.840]  But, I mean, trust me, like I said, man,
[54:46.840 --> 54:49.040]  I've had this burner for five years
[54:49.040 --> 54:50.200]  and haven't even used it.
[54:50.200 --> 54:52.960]  And the real limitation for me was the light.
[54:52.960 --> 54:53.920]  It didn't make sense.
[54:53.920 --> 54:56.520]  Like HPS and a small tent,
[54:56.520 --> 54:58.680]  I wasn't gonna be able to hit the lighting number.
[54:58.680 --> 55:01.040]  So it didn't make sense to have CO2.
[55:01.800 --> 55:03.280]  You gotta remember like when you're growing,
[55:03.280 --> 55:05.880]  especially living soil, it's kind of like a race car.
[55:05.880 --> 55:07.960]  You know, a lot of guys use that analogy,
[55:07.960 --> 55:10.680]  you know, where your soil, your light,
[55:10.680 --> 55:13.080]  and then what you're feeding your plants and environment,
[55:13.080 --> 55:15.080]  all those things have to go up together.
[55:15.080 --> 55:16.000]  You know, I can't just say,
[55:16.000 --> 55:18.080]  all right, I'm gonna throw CO2 at this.
[55:18.080 --> 55:20.080]  Well, whatever you threw, you know,
[55:20.080 --> 55:21.720]  you could show a deficiency.
[55:21.720 --> 55:23.400]  It could be detrimental.
[55:23.400 --> 55:27.920]  So like Brian said, man, CO2, it's not necessary.
[55:27.920 --> 55:28.880]  Trust me.
[55:28.880 --> 55:31.000]  It's something that I'm always pushing.
[55:31.000 --> 55:31.880]  Y'all know me.
[55:31.880 --> 55:34.400]  I'm at the point in my game now where I can just go out
[55:34.400 --> 55:37.240]  and just, you know, spend a few dollars
[55:37.240 --> 55:40.040]  and try to get this shit and test it and try it.
[55:40.040 --> 55:41.400]  So I'm doing that for myself,
[55:41.400 --> 55:43.320]  but I'm also doing it to share for the community
[55:43.320 --> 55:45.560]  and kind of give the home grower, you know,
[55:45.560 --> 55:48.800]  let's dial in some CO2 with natural farming,
[55:48.800 --> 55:50.400]  you know, step this thing on up.
[55:52.760 --> 55:54.840]  Yeah, I think that's well said, brother.
[55:54.840 --> 55:57.960]  I mean, the CO2, you know,
[55:58.920 --> 56:01.000]  when we were poor and we just had a tent, you know,
[56:01.000 --> 56:02.160]  we'd smoke blunts in there.
[56:02.160 --> 56:05.600]  I mean, I don't necessarily think that's the way to go,
[56:05.600 --> 56:07.560]  but you can do certain things like that.
[56:07.560 --> 56:10.720]  I think it's probably, you know, in hindsight,
[56:10.720 --> 56:12.360]  that's probably detrimental to blowing a bunch
[56:12.360 --> 56:14.960]  of tobacco smoke around your plants.
[56:14.960 --> 56:18.640]  But I did see a small benefit when we were doing that.
[56:18.640 --> 56:21.360]  Over the long haul, probably stunting growth
[56:21.360 --> 56:23.280]  if I was being honest with it.
[56:23.960 --> 56:28.120]  But yeah, CO2 is just the,
[56:28.120 --> 56:30.040]  like if you're using the race car analogy,
[56:30.040 --> 56:32.960]  hey, that's, you know, you put in a chip or something
[56:32.960 --> 56:35.920]  and now your car's just a little bit better.
[56:35.920 --> 56:36.880]  There you go.
[56:36.880 --> 56:37.720]  A little bit faster.
[56:37.720 --> 56:40.560]  And I know a lot of the home growers, you know,
[56:40.560 --> 56:43.160]  it's kind of a question here asking about the tent
[56:43.160 --> 56:45.920]  and the fan size and, you know, if it's not really sealed,
[56:45.920 --> 56:47.240]  it's hard to keep it in.
[56:47.240 --> 56:49.400]  And so that's where a lot of the debate goes,
[56:49.400 --> 56:52.000]  but he mentions the exhale bag.
[56:52.000 --> 56:53.200]  And that kind of made me think,
[56:54.040 --> 56:55.280]  because again, that's what the home growers will do.
[56:55.280 --> 56:57.240]  I think ambient is like around 400.
[56:57.240 --> 56:58.080]  But again, if you set-
[56:58.080 --> 56:59.040]  That seems like a damn gimmick to me.
[56:59.040 --> 56:59.880]  If you set-
[56:59.880 --> 57:01.720]  Because we used to put them on top of the HPS lights
[57:01.720 --> 57:03.440]  and it would puff up, but.
[57:03.440 --> 57:04.280]  Right.
[57:04.280 --> 57:05.120]  Yeah.
[57:05.120 --> 57:05.960]  I, we-
[57:05.960 --> 57:08.720]  You'd need a lot of those exhale bags, I think.
[57:08.720 --> 57:12.080]  I think that was debunked back when that came out.
[57:12.080 --> 57:13.640]  I didn't care for it back then.
[57:13.640 --> 57:15.320]  I remember there was a crew that was,
[57:15.320 --> 57:19.200]  people liked it, people, I think it's gone, but whatever.
[57:19.200 --> 57:20.040]  Yeah, well, it-
[57:20.040 --> 57:22.440]  I wanted to, one little caveat with the CO2
[57:22.480 --> 57:23.800]  before we move on.
[57:23.800 --> 57:26.120]  I interviewed a gentleman that was talking about
[57:26.120 --> 57:28.800]  how his secret, he called himself a master grower.
[57:28.800 --> 57:31.280]  So take that for what it is right there.
[57:31.280 --> 57:33.520]  But he was telling me in the interview process
[57:33.520 --> 57:36.520]  that his secret was to pump CO2 at night.
[57:36.520 --> 57:39.080]  Now for you newer farmers, them, okay,
[57:39.080 --> 57:41.880]  that might, but for a lot of the advanced farmers,
[57:41.880 --> 57:44.080]  plants aren't taking up that at night, right?
[57:44.080 --> 57:46.680]  They need, they need sunlight to be able
[57:46.680 --> 57:48.000]  to start to take things in.
[57:48.000 --> 57:51.080]  So I don't know why that was out there for a while,
[57:51.080 --> 57:53.960]  but some people, I guess we're reading forums
[57:53.960 --> 57:56.760]  were pumping CO2 at night.
[57:56.760 --> 57:59.120]  And to me, that's just pissing away money.
[57:59.120 --> 58:00.400]  Wasting money, wow.
[58:00.400 --> 58:01.240]  See, that's why we-
[58:01.240 --> 58:03.160]  Shout out to the master growers, right?
[58:03.160 --> 58:04.000]  Yeah, man.
[58:04.000 --> 58:06.760]  Don't ever, I mean, I'll never call myself a master
[58:06.760 --> 58:08.200]  and don't ever call me that
[58:08.200 --> 58:11.120]  because I am just learning my craft.
[58:11.120 --> 58:12.520]  I'm still getting better.
[58:12.520 --> 58:14.360]  I'm trying to get better every day.
[58:15.320 --> 58:18.280]  If you think you got this shit mastered, you wrong, bro.
[58:18.280 --> 58:20.880]  Like it's hard to master anything.
[58:21.720 --> 58:25.080]  In life, it's all, to me, it's just a process,
[58:26.000 --> 58:29.360]  getting better, get better, get better.
[58:29.360 --> 58:31.280]  Yeah, it's always the wannabes that call themselves
[58:31.280 --> 58:32.400]  the master grower.
[58:32.400 --> 58:33.840]  And the ones that you would probably
[58:33.840 --> 58:35.080]  would call a master grower
[58:35.080 --> 58:37.120]  always kind of qualify themselves as like,
[58:37.120 --> 58:39.720]  well, I just want to say like, I'm not a hundred percent.
[58:39.720 --> 58:43.080]  They're always qualifying that they're not fully expert
[58:43.080 --> 58:44.120]  on this kind of thing.
[58:44.120 --> 58:46.800]  Those are the people that you want to listen to and follow.
[58:46.800 --> 58:47.960]  Cause that's the smart person.
[58:47.960 --> 58:50.840]  The smart person knows that, I mean, really,
[58:51.680 --> 58:53.200]  do we think we can explain nature?
[58:53.200 --> 58:55.640]  Because that's really what we're trying to do here.
[58:55.640 --> 58:58.080]  So yeah, if you-
[58:58.080 --> 59:01.080]  Yeah, you're a bad ass if you can explain that,
[59:01.080 --> 59:02.360]  you're a master.
[59:02.360 --> 59:03.400]  Yeah, yeah.
[59:03.400 --> 59:04.880]  Well, let's get to something
[59:04.880 --> 59:07.760]  that does have an explanation though.
[59:07.760 --> 59:09.680]  And just, can you speak about using wood chips
[59:09.680 --> 59:11.080]  in a thermo compost?
[59:11.080 --> 59:13.760]  And if you had the local tree cutting crew
[59:13.760 --> 59:16.280]  during the power outage, they're chipping them up.
[59:16.280 --> 59:17.960]  Can you grab those from the side of the road
[59:17.960 --> 59:19.680]  and toss them in?
[59:19.680 --> 59:22.120]  Maybe depending upon what type of tree it is.
[59:22.120 --> 59:23.120]  Yeah, you want to be-
[59:23.120 --> 59:25.720]  I wouldn't take anything from the side of the road though.
[59:26.760 --> 59:28.960]  Well, yeah, I mean, yeah, you don't want to just,
[59:28.960 --> 59:32.200]  okay, yeah, there's a pile by the road or highway.
[59:32.200 --> 59:33.040]  Yeah, I get that.
[59:33.040 --> 59:35.200]  But now if they're cutting trees and you,
[59:35.200 --> 59:37.280]  hey guy, can you dump them on our property?
[59:37.280 --> 59:38.480]  Yeah, that's good stuff.
[59:40.240 --> 59:43.320]  Try to look for, you don't want loads of pine,
[59:43.320 --> 59:45.600]  try not to try to limit your amounts of pine.
[59:45.600 --> 59:47.040]  The reason we want hardwoods,
[59:47.040 --> 59:49.560]  cause hardwoods are gonna increase the fungi
[59:50.440 --> 59:51.280]  on your property.
[59:51.280 --> 59:52.800]  We want like a hardwood forest.
[59:52.800 --> 59:55.560]  Pine creates good IMO as well,
[59:55.560 --> 59:59.900]  but I don't want a pine dominated, you know, wood chips.
[59:59.900 --> 01:00:04.900]  Now I do use wood chips to create soil or compost them.
[01:00:05.080 --> 01:00:08.340]  And I like to use wood chips, shredded leaves.
[01:00:08.340 --> 01:00:11.480]  And I like to use Bokashi food scraps as my grain.
[01:00:11.480 --> 01:00:14.000]  Like Bokashi food scraps are very,
[01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.120]  like they really kick up your pile.
[01:00:17.040 --> 01:00:18.120]  It's something you can just,
[01:00:18.120 --> 01:00:20.440]  every day you guys eat dinner at the house,
[01:00:20.440 --> 01:00:23.340]  store your old food scraps in a bucket.
[01:00:23.340 --> 01:00:26.040]  If you got a little LAB, toss it in there
[01:00:26.040 --> 01:00:28.640]  and kind of get in a Bokashi bucket going.
[01:00:28.640 --> 01:00:32.620]  Use that as your grain to crank up those wood chips
[01:00:32.620 --> 01:00:34.760]  because wood chips are very hard to break down.
[01:00:34.760 --> 01:00:36.680]  They take a lot of energy.
[01:00:36.680 --> 01:00:39.800]  So when I, and I was able to successfully break them down
[01:00:39.800 --> 01:00:42.880]  in about 10 months with just heavy Bokashi,
[01:00:42.880 --> 01:00:46.800]  turning them in and the shredded leaves.
[01:00:49.040 --> 01:00:51.600]  Yeah, wood chips seem to be key.
[01:00:51.600 --> 01:00:53.400]  Like we had mentioned the salt, silt and clay.
[01:00:53.400 --> 01:00:57.080]  I was able to go and visit Steve Cantwell's farm.
[01:00:57.080 --> 01:00:59.400]  And he was talking about one of the main things
[01:00:59.400 --> 01:01:02.760]  that he's changed where he's seen serious success
[01:01:02.760 --> 01:01:04.800]  was adding green sand and wood chips.
[01:01:06.480 --> 01:01:07.320]  So.
[01:01:07.320 --> 01:01:14.320]  On that road a little bit.
[01:01:15.320 --> 01:01:16.280]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:01:16.280 --> 01:01:17.640]  Yeah, wood chips, man.
[01:01:18.520 --> 01:01:19.600]  Oh, Chad's on mute.
[01:01:20.720 --> 01:01:22.240]  I was just saying, I think your microphone
[01:01:22.240 --> 01:01:23.920]  was going in and out there, Brian.
[01:01:24.920 --> 01:01:26.680]  Yeah, we got you at the end though.
[01:01:26.680 --> 01:01:28.160]  Oh, okay.
[01:01:28.160 --> 01:01:30.120]  I just wanted to let everybody know on the fourth,
[01:01:30.120 --> 01:01:32.160]  I'm gonna have all new shit, boy.
[01:01:32.160 --> 01:01:33.640]  I knew everything.
[01:01:33.640 --> 01:01:34.480]  So.
[01:01:34.480 --> 01:01:35.400]  All shit.
[01:01:35.400 --> 01:01:37.720]  Yeah, hopefully that doesn't happen anymore.
[01:01:37.720 --> 01:01:38.760]  Exactly.
[01:01:38.760 --> 01:01:40.280]  Hey, we're growing every day, baby.
[01:01:40.280 --> 01:01:41.240]  We're growing everywhere.
[01:01:41.240 --> 01:01:44.080]  I got me a new cam, you know, got my headphones now.
[01:01:44.840 --> 01:01:46.200]  We're getting our shit together here.
[01:01:46.200 --> 01:01:47.640]  So y'all just bear with us.
[01:01:48.560 --> 01:01:52.000]  Yeah, I got these like $20 headphones that I've been using.
[01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:55.080]  And now I got this, you know,
[01:01:55.080 --> 01:01:57.080]  I can't really use it until I get all my other stuff.
[01:01:57.080 --> 01:02:00.640]  But just wanting to let you guys know that for 2022,
[01:02:00.640 --> 01:02:02.520]  we're coming with the heat.
[01:02:02.520 --> 01:02:05.160]  We wanna do some more all site locations too, y'all.
[01:02:05.160 --> 01:02:07.480]  Like I think that'll be dope.
[01:02:07.480 --> 01:02:10.360]  Yeah, and I hope I'm not speaking out of turn here, Marco,
[01:02:10.360 --> 01:02:13.960]  but we have a lot of free time coming in 2022.
[01:02:14.840 --> 01:02:16.440]  The way that I kind of set things up.
[01:02:16.440 --> 01:02:18.400]  So we hope to be traveling,
[01:02:18.400 --> 01:02:21.240]  going to a lot more of the actual events
[01:02:21.240 --> 01:02:25.080]  and maybe in time we can kind of do more interviews,
[01:02:25.080 --> 01:02:26.680]  live interviews and that kind of stuff.
[01:02:26.680 --> 01:02:30.240]  So looking forward to that and looking forward to hopefully
[01:02:30.240 --> 01:02:32.080]  going around the country with Chad and Marco
[01:02:32.080 --> 01:02:36.520]  and exploring what Living Soil is really all about,
[01:02:36.520 --> 01:02:38.920]  especially at the commercial level.
[01:02:38.920 --> 01:02:40.520]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:02:40.520 --> 01:02:42.200]  Green fingers, Thomas.
[01:02:42.200 --> 01:02:43.520]  You're a funny dude.
[01:02:44.800 --> 01:02:46.720]  So I got a question for you guys.
[01:02:46.720 --> 01:02:48.080]  Sometimes the elephant in the room
[01:02:48.080 --> 01:02:50.840]  with a lot of the salt growers or, you know,
[01:02:50.840 --> 01:02:53.760]  Synganix is kind of another one people are going.
[01:02:55.760 --> 01:02:57.320]  At the end of the day,
[01:02:57.320 --> 01:03:01.960]  the root tip sees the same chemical composition,
[01:03:01.960 --> 01:03:06.760]  whether it was from organic source or a synthetic source.
[01:03:06.760 --> 01:03:09.320]  Is that true?
[01:03:10.200 --> 01:03:11.880]  Like you put in your organics,
[01:03:11.880 --> 01:03:16.640]  the microbes break it down into the same composite chemical
[01:03:16.640 --> 01:03:19.960]  that the synthetics would be.
[01:03:19.960 --> 01:03:23.280]  And then the root is blind to basically its source.
[01:03:25.040 --> 01:03:26.920]  You know, that's a great question, Chad,
[01:03:26.920 --> 01:03:29.320]  but I don't think so.
[01:03:29.320 --> 01:03:32.840]  And the reason I don't think so is because
[01:03:32.840 --> 01:03:35.720]  you didn't start with exactly the same,
[01:03:35.720 --> 01:03:38.080]  even though it's gonna break.
[01:03:38.080 --> 01:03:40.720]  So, okay.
[01:03:40.720 --> 01:03:45.200]  You didn't start with the exact same starting material.
[01:03:46.320 --> 01:03:48.960]  So to me, I feel like once that,
[01:03:48.960 --> 01:03:50.960]  so when that starting material breaks down
[01:03:50.960 --> 01:03:52.560]  and then the synthetic breaks down,
[01:03:52.560 --> 01:03:55.680]  sure, ultimately the plant's gonna use it.
[01:03:55.680 --> 01:03:58.240]  I wonder if the plant would have a preference.
[01:03:58.240 --> 01:04:00.640]  I think, you know, I think so,
[01:04:00.640 --> 01:04:05.040]  because I think you're gonna have more of a biological input
[01:04:05.040 --> 01:04:08.920]  than you would coming from the synthetic side.
[01:04:08.920 --> 01:04:10.480]  Just talking it out.
[01:04:10.480 --> 01:04:12.800]  Yeah, no, because I mean, it is kind of a tough one.
[01:04:12.800 --> 01:04:16.040]  Like I understand that point of view.
[01:04:16.040 --> 01:04:18.000]  It's like at the end of the day,
[01:04:19.120 --> 01:04:21.760]  and again, this is speaking of ignorance,
[01:04:21.760 --> 01:04:22.600]  but at the end of the day,
[01:04:22.600 --> 01:04:24.480]  the root tip sees the exact same thing.
[01:04:24.480 --> 01:04:25.880]  It says, yeah, I'll take it.
[01:04:27.440 --> 01:04:31.600]  But there is something to things that are grown
[01:04:31.600 --> 01:04:33.960]  in a living soil.
[01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:37.000]  And then this just relates to food versus a synthetic.
[01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.480]  So I can't necessarily put my fingertip on it.
[01:04:39.480 --> 01:04:43.800]  Maybe it's not the importance of the form
[01:04:43.800 --> 01:04:45.400]  that the plant gets the chemical,
[01:04:45.400 --> 01:04:47.320]  but it's all of it that's around it,
[01:04:47.320 --> 01:04:50.000]  or maybe in a synthetic that's not around it,
[01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:53.040]  that is imparting something that we can't explain yet.
[01:04:53.040 --> 01:04:55.880]  But that's a favorite argument of a lot of soil growers.
[01:04:55.880 --> 01:04:58.000]  It's like root tip doesn't care, man.
[01:04:58.000 --> 01:04:59.480]  End of the day, same stuff.
[01:04:59.480 --> 01:05:02.520]  Well, but I think the root tip does care
[01:05:02.520 --> 01:05:04.080]  because here's why.
[01:05:04.080 --> 01:05:07.120]  I think mycorrhizal fungi,
[01:05:07.120 --> 01:05:11.080]  that relationship between root tip and root,
[01:05:11.080 --> 01:05:13.720]  and I don't think you have the mycorrhizal fungi
[01:05:13.720 --> 01:05:16.520]  relationship on the synthetic side.
[01:05:16.520 --> 01:05:20.200]  I think what that does is it makes the plant,
[01:05:20.200 --> 01:05:22.880]  it gives the plant easier way to take up
[01:05:22.880 --> 01:05:26.200]  that biology side nutrient than it does the synthetic.
[01:05:26.200 --> 01:05:27.040]  I think so,
[01:05:27.040 --> 01:05:28.520]  because I feel like that relationship
[01:05:28.520 --> 01:05:30.960]  with the mycorrhizal fungi.
[01:05:30.960 --> 01:05:33.320]  But like Brian said, I'm no expert.
[01:05:33.320 --> 01:05:36.360]  I'm just throwing stuff out there, logical thinking,
[01:05:36.360 --> 01:05:38.840]  and it's kind of my thought process.
[01:05:38.840 --> 01:05:40.800]  I'm always gonna lead towards naturally.
[01:05:40.800 --> 01:05:42.600]  You know which way I'm going.
[01:05:42.600 --> 01:05:43.640]  Right, right.
[01:05:43.640 --> 01:05:47.080]  I figured what better people to ask this question to though.
[01:05:47.080 --> 01:05:48.160]  Right, right.
[01:05:48.160 --> 01:05:51.200]  I've personally kind of had this discussion a few times
[01:05:51.200 --> 01:05:53.200]  with bright-minded individuals.
[01:05:53.200 --> 01:05:56.360]  And the one way that I felt like kind of made sense to me
[01:05:56.360 --> 01:05:59.120]  was nitrate nitrogen.
[01:05:59.120 --> 01:06:01.600]  So when the plant is taking up nitrate nitrogen,
[01:06:01.600 --> 01:06:04.520]  the root, the plant will take that up no matter what,
[01:06:04.520 --> 01:06:06.280]  later into flower, that kind of stuff,
[01:06:06.280 --> 01:06:07.600]  where it's going to hinder your yields
[01:06:07.600 --> 01:06:08.800]  and that kind of stuff.
[01:06:08.800 --> 01:06:10.320]  Where from what I understand,
[01:06:10.320 --> 01:06:13.040]  when you're using more of the microbial approach,
[01:06:13.040 --> 01:06:16.400]  the plants are more of an ammonia nitrogen form
[01:06:16.400 --> 01:06:18.920]  where they know at some certain point
[01:06:18.920 --> 01:06:20.300]  when the plant has flipped,
[01:06:20.300 --> 01:06:22.520]  that they don't necessarily have to keep taking up
[01:06:22.520 --> 01:06:23.960]  that nitrogen anymore.
[01:06:24.820 --> 01:06:27.520]  Again, these are just talking with buddies.
[01:06:27.720 --> 01:06:31.280]  These weren't PhDs or anything like that.
[01:06:31.280 --> 01:06:33.480]  But I do personally feel that
[01:06:33.480 --> 01:06:35.560]  when I was growing with synthetics,
[01:06:35.560 --> 01:06:38.200]  we were extremely heavy on the feeds.
[01:06:38.200 --> 01:06:41.640]  Our plants would be a heavy, heavy dark green
[01:06:41.640 --> 01:06:42.880]  late into flower.
[01:06:42.880 --> 01:06:45.160]  And I feel that's because we were overfeeding
[01:06:45.160 --> 01:06:48.000]  nitrate nitrogen and the plant was taking it up.
[01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:49.800]  The root was excited to see that
[01:06:49.800 --> 01:06:52.560]  where on the flip side of things,
[01:06:52.560 --> 01:06:54.200]  it seems like the microbial life
[01:06:54.200 --> 01:06:57.200]  knows the difference somehow.
[01:06:58.040 --> 01:06:59.760]  You're saying in that synthetic form,
[01:06:59.760 --> 01:07:01.000]  it doesn't have a choice.
[01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.420]  When that root touches and that synthetics touch,
[01:07:03.420 --> 01:07:05.800]  it's basically gonna go, it's gonna-
[01:07:05.800 --> 01:07:08.280]  Hell yeah, but it's like me when I'm stoned late at night
[01:07:08.280 --> 01:07:10.640]  with peanut butter M&Ms,
[01:07:10.640 --> 01:07:12.360]  until I started doing fasting.
[01:07:12.360 --> 01:07:16.320]  But when I had all those horrible microbes in my gut,
[01:07:16.320 --> 01:07:19.240]  those microbes needed to be fed, especially at night.
[01:07:19.240 --> 01:07:21.080]  And so it was almost like, man,
[01:07:21.080 --> 01:07:23.820]  it's really hard not to wanna be able to take that up.
[01:07:23.820 --> 01:07:26.880]  And if, again, this is probably a poor way
[01:07:27.560 --> 01:07:29.720]  of explaining that, but from what I understand,
[01:07:29.720 --> 01:07:31.840]  the plant just loves to take that up.
[01:07:31.840 --> 01:07:33.200]  That's her peanut butter M&Ms.
[01:07:33.200 --> 01:07:34.320]  She's gonna take that shit up,
[01:07:34.320 --> 01:07:37.480]  whether it's in veg or flour.
[01:07:37.480 --> 01:07:38.700]  All right, so there we go.
[01:07:38.700 --> 01:07:41.240]  There's our answer, Chad.
[01:07:41.240 --> 01:07:44.320]  Everyone likes junk food, but it ain't the best for you.
[01:07:44.320 --> 01:07:46.360]  Yes, this is true.
[01:07:46.360 --> 01:07:47.200]  This is so true.
[01:07:47.200 --> 01:07:49.040]  It ain't good for you.
[01:07:49.040 --> 01:07:52.800]  And it was one of the guests on this show.
[01:07:52.800 --> 01:07:54.120]  I'm trying to think of his name,
[01:07:54.120 --> 01:07:58.280]  but he had the red flannel, awesome mustache from Canada.
[01:07:58.280 --> 01:07:59.120]  Terraflora.
[01:07:59.120 --> 01:07:59.960]  Oh, Terraflora.
[01:07:59.960 --> 01:08:01.080]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:08:01.080 --> 01:08:04.080]  Talking about, we know certain food is bad for us.
[01:08:04.080 --> 01:08:05.000]  Why do we have it?
[01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:06.240]  Why is it available?
[01:08:06.240 --> 01:08:07.360]  Like, why?
[01:08:07.360 --> 01:08:08.200]  Why?
[01:08:08.200 --> 01:08:09.040]  We know there's good.
[01:08:09.040 --> 01:08:09.860]  Why do we have this shit?
[01:08:09.860 --> 01:08:12.080]  And if you haven't watched that episode,
[01:08:12.080 --> 01:08:12.960]  go back and watch that,
[01:08:12.960 --> 01:08:15.240]  because he's talking about gut microbes at the beginning.
[01:08:15.240 --> 01:08:16.920]  And I feel like that is the same thing.
[01:08:16.920 --> 01:08:20.360]  When you start to grow with microbes in your plants,
[01:08:20.360 --> 01:08:22.320]  you're gonna start to really second guess
[01:08:22.360 --> 01:08:24.120]  about what you're putting in your body
[01:08:24.120 --> 01:08:25.560]  and the fact that you're continuing
[01:08:25.560 --> 01:08:27.120]  to feed those bad microbes.
[01:08:27.120 --> 01:08:28.680]  And what do they always say?
[01:08:28.680 --> 01:08:30.280]  That's the definition of insanity
[01:08:30.280 --> 01:08:31.520]  when you keep doing the same thing,
[01:08:31.520 --> 01:08:33.240]  expecting different results.
[01:08:33.240 --> 01:08:36.200]  And I know for me for a long time, I just, I don't know.
[01:08:36.200 --> 01:08:38.740]  I just, my gut health wasn't where it needed to be
[01:08:38.740 --> 01:08:41.120]  until I started again with the kefir
[01:08:41.120 --> 01:08:43.600]  and like all these other like good microbes.
[01:08:43.600 --> 01:08:44.680]  So I think at the end of the day,
[01:08:44.680 --> 01:08:46.880]  the answer to this question is,
[01:08:46.880 --> 01:08:50.320]  the microbial life seems to know the difference.
[01:08:50.640 --> 01:08:53.120]  And however the scientifically that is,
[01:08:53.120 --> 01:08:55.760]  maybe we need to have somebody a lot smarter than us
[01:08:55.760 --> 01:08:57.520]  be able to break that down for you.
[01:08:58.600 --> 01:08:59.720]  I definitely agree.
[01:08:59.720 --> 01:09:02.240]  And here's something that I've actually heard you talk about
[01:09:02.240 --> 01:09:03.720]  speaking of from the gut.
[01:09:04.680 --> 01:09:07.440]  Can I use sheep compost indoors?
[01:09:09.440 --> 01:09:11.920]  No, I've never used sheep compost.
[01:09:13.080 --> 01:09:13.920]  I'm really-
[01:09:13.920 --> 01:09:14.760]  Just out of coal.
[01:09:14.760 --> 01:09:16.080]  Yeah.
[01:09:16.080 --> 01:09:19.060]  If you're gonna, if you wanna use that kind of compost,
[01:09:19.060 --> 01:09:21.820]  I really recommend for obviously indoors,
[01:09:21.820 --> 01:09:24.140]  I've always used the Lionhead rabbit manure
[01:09:24.140 --> 01:09:27.740]  and then outdoors, or if you're a larger indoor facility,
[01:09:27.740 --> 01:09:28.940]  then use the alpaca.
[01:09:30.460 --> 01:09:32.020]  Yeah, and definitely, yeah.
[01:09:32.020 --> 01:09:34.620]  If you don't have those two, if you have sheep,
[01:09:34.620 --> 01:09:37.620]  pile it up or static pile it at the very minimum,
[01:09:37.620 --> 01:09:39.900]  let it just sit outdoors and let the microbes
[01:09:39.900 --> 01:09:43.860]  and all that come into it and populate it
[01:09:43.860 --> 01:09:46.460]  or just compost it first.
[01:09:46.460 --> 01:09:48.140]  And because what happens is,
[01:09:48.140 --> 01:09:49.860]  land animals have, like,
[01:09:52.740 --> 01:09:54.580]  the shit, I just lost my train of thought,
[01:09:54.580 --> 01:09:56.420]  but the shit you always get in hamburgers
[01:09:56.420 --> 01:09:58.380]  when everybody gets sick.
[01:09:58.380 --> 01:09:59.220]  The growth hormones and all that.
[01:09:59.220 --> 01:10:00.700]  The hormones and all that pink slime stuff.
[01:10:00.700 --> 01:10:02.860]  No, like the bacteria when everyone gets food poisoning.
[01:10:02.860 --> 01:10:03.700]  Oh, E. coli.
[01:10:03.700 --> 01:10:04.540]  E. coli.
[01:10:04.540 --> 01:10:05.380]  Yeah.
[01:10:05.380 --> 01:10:08.060]  So land animals contain E. coli in their shit
[01:10:08.060 --> 01:10:09.460]  and in their bodies, you know what I mean?
[01:10:09.460 --> 01:10:12.020]  So a lot of times you wanna really make sure
[01:10:12.020 --> 01:10:14.740]  you compost that well before you bring it into your garden.
[01:10:14.740 --> 01:10:16.140]  Can be pathogenic.
[01:10:16.140 --> 01:10:17.940]  The reason the lion's head rabbit
[01:10:17.940 --> 01:10:21.300]  and the alpaca are called coal manures,
[01:10:21.300 --> 01:10:22.340]  as Brian just mentioned,
[01:10:22.340 --> 01:10:27.340]  because their poop is basically free of any pathogens.
[01:10:27.380 --> 01:10:29.600]  It's a well broken down.
[01:10:29.600 --> 01:10:32.460]  Their gut microbes have basically composted it.
[01:10:32.460 --> 01:10:33.580]  You know, so when it comes out,
[01:10:33.580 --> 01:10:35.320]  it's readily available to plants.
[01:10:36.420 --> 01:10:37.980]  Yeah, as soon as it comes out of the animal,
[01:10:37.980 --> 01:10:40.460]  you can put it on your plant if you wanted to.
[01:10:40.460 --> 01:10:43.340]  I personally, if I had like a huge thing of alpaca,
[01:10:43.340 --> 01:10:45.020]  I would just run some composting worms
[01:10:45.020 --> 01:10:46.700]  just to make sure.
[01:10:46.700 --> 01:10:49.140]  But again, maybe that was a little overkill.
[01:10:49.140 --> 01:10:51.900]  But if you, especially if you're newer to this,
[01:10:51.900 --> 01:10:53.260]  throw some composting worms in there,
[01:10:53.260 --> 01:10:54.620]  let them run through that a little bit,
[01:10:54.620 --> 01:10:56.780]  maybe a week or two and you should be fine.
[01:10:59.300 --> 01:11:04.140]  Here's one that isn't necessarily related to gardening.
[01:11:04.140 --> 01:11:05.840]  It's more of the end result.
[01:11:07.420 --> 01:11:09.660]  Do you guys have a favorite for,
[01:11:09.660 --> 01:11:12.540]  I worked too hard in the garden today.
[01:11:12.540 --> 01:11:14.580]  I need to roll up this.
[01:11:15.980 --> 01:11:20.980]  I wouldn't say I necessarily have like a specific go to
[01:11:22.740 --> 01:11:24.180]  strain for pain.
[01:11:24.180 --> 01:11:25.620]  And pain is subjective, man.
[01:11:25.620 --> 01:11:29.020]  There's muscle pain, there's skeletal pain, there's yeah.
[01:11:29.020 --> 01:11:31.940]  But when you guys, when you in particular.
[01:11:31.940 --> 01:11:34.460]  Yeah, I don't know if I have a strain per se,
[01:11:34.460 --> 01:11:36.860]  but I like, you know, in the evenings, you know,
[01:11:36.860 --> 01:11:39.460]  to be pretty much knocked down in the evenings
[01:11:39.460 --> 01:11:41.300]  and I'm kind of high strung in the day.
[01:11:41.300 --> 01:11:43.380]  So I like to keep it uplifting during the day.
[01:11:43.420 --> 01:11:44.260]  You know what I mean?
[01:11:44.260 --> 01:11:45.100]  While I'm working.
[01:11:46.060 --> 01:11:48.900]  I don't have a specific strain.
[01:11:48.900 --> 01:11:51.100]  Usually whatever is in my jar.
[01:11:51.980 --> 01:11:52.820]  I will say,
[01:11:54.220 --> 01:11:56.980]  back especially when you're farming like 16 hour days
[01:11:56.980 --> 01:11:57.820]  and just constantly,
[01:11:57.820 --> 01:12:01.460]  I would go to like a yoga class high as hell on a Saturday
[01:12:01.460 --> 01:12:03.380]  and that seemed to alleviate a lot of the pain.
[01:12:03.380 --> 01:12:04.980]  So you're stretching and you're high
[01:12:04.980 --> 01:12:06.900]  and kind of just feeling good.
[01:12:06.900 --> 01:12:08.940]  I would say that's more how I dealt with pain
[01:12:08.940 --> 01:12:11.460]  is using cannabis, but at the same time,
[01:12:11.500 --> 01:12:14.860]  it's either working out or going to like a yoga class.
[01:12:14.860 --> 01:12:16.020]  That's a good point.
[01:12:16.020 --> 01:12:17.460]  Yeah, excellent advice there.
[01:12:17.460 --> 01:12:19.580]  Tune the body, you know, keep the body tuned.
[01:12:19.580 --> 01:12:22.500]  You can't eat McDonald's all day
[01:12:22.500 --> 01:12:24.580]  and then wonder why you're not running the marathon.
[01:12:24.580 --> 01:12:25.540]  That's right.
[01:12:25.540 --> 01:12:28.580]  And there's something that my wife and I have been getting
[01:12:28.580 --> 01:12:30.700]  into is kind of gaining a little steam.
[01:12:30.700 --> 01:12:32.420]  It's called Araveda.
[01:12:32.420 --> 01:12:36.340]  R-A-Y-R-U-V-E-D-A, I believe it's spelled.
[01:12:36.340 --> 01:12:39.480]  It's an Indian from over there in India.
[01:12:39.480 --> 01:12:44.080]  And what it is, is it's identifying your body type,
[01:12:44.080 --> 01:12:48.240]  it's your dosha, and then matching the foods
[01:12:48.240 --> 01:12:51.320]  and the way you eat to that body type.
[01:12:51.320 --> 01:12:53.480]  I think that's been, that's been helping us a lot, man.
[01:12:53.480 --> 01:12:57.760]  It's Deepak Chopra talks a lot about it.
[01:12:57.760 --> 01:13:02.760]  And like, man, those things, he kind of ties internal,
[01:13:03.240 --> 01:13:06.000]  like we were talking gut health with physical,
[01:13:06.440 --> 01:13:10.280]  and environmental as far as overall body health.
[01:13:10.280 --> 01:13:12.920]  So, I mean, just like we're pushing the limits.
[01:13:12.920 --> 01:13:15.560]  And it's funny because when my wife is teaching me this,
[01:13:15.560 --> 01:13:19.000]  it's just the same shit that I'm saying for my soil.
[01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:20.800]  You know, it's the exact same principle.
[01:13:20.800 --> 01:13:23.400]  It's like feeding the gut of your,
[01:13:23.400 --> 01:13:24.880]  feeding your gut the right way,
[01:13:24.880 --> 01:13:26.480]  while feeding my soil the right way.
[01:13:26.480 --> 01:13:29.440]  It's like all these things kind of intertwine, you know.
[01:13:30.740 --> 01:13:32.680]  You know, I can't just be a natural farmer
[01:13:32.680 --> 01:13:35.680]  and give my garden and my soil all those good inputs
[01:13:36.360 --> 01:13:37.440]  and then I eat like shit, you know what I mean?
[01:13:37.440 --> 01:13:39.680]  You guys, it's got, it kind of goes together,
[01:13:39.680 --> 01:13:40.840]  you know what I mean?
[01:13:40.840 --> 01:13:42.800]  And no one's perfect, I get it.
[01:13:42.800 --> 01:13:45.840]  But as you're working through natural farming,
[01:13:45.840 --> 01:13:48.920]  use it to also build up yourself, man, you know.
[01:13:48.920 --> 01:13:51.760]  Use it to make yourself stronger, you know what I mean?
[01:13:52.760 --> 01:13:54.560]  It's amazing what you can get done in a week
[01:13:54.560 --> 01:13:56.360]  when you feel fantastic compared to when
[01:13:56.360 --> 01:13:58.680]  you're always run down, tired, drained.
[01:13:58.680 --> 01:14:01.160]  And a lot of that comes down to gut health.
[01:14:01.160 --> 01:14:04.280]  For you newer viewers, that's kind of what we were,
[01:14:04.280 --> 01:14:06.120]  that's why we were always kind of talking about that.
[01:14:06.120 --> 01:14:09.560]  The soil is the gut, that's the stomach of that system.
[01:14:09.560 --> 01:14:10.960]  And so that's why we always recommend
[01:14:10.960 --> 01:14:13.320]  about having a larger gut, if you will.
[01:14:13.320 --> 01:14:17.680]  So 20, 20 gallon, 25 gallon is what we usually recommend
[01:14:17.680 --> 01:14:19.840]  just to start because the bigger the gut,
[01:14:19.840 --> 01:14:23.000]  the easier it is, it's gonna be to dial that in.
[01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.080]  And then like we've mentioned many, many times,
[01:14:25.080 --> 01:14:27.560]  once you start to see your plants' overall health,
[01:14:27.560 --> 01:14:31.040]  the praying leaves and just everything about that,
[01:14:31.040 --> 01:14:32.920]  if you're not second guessing what you're doing,
[01:14:32.920 --> 01:14:34.400]  then I feel like you're missing a lot
[01:14:34.400 --> 01:14:36.700]  of what mother nature is trying to show you.
[01:14:39.950 --> 01:14:43.510]  I've got a twofer from Ty's Trees here.
[01:14:43.510 --> 01:14:45.990]  First one specifically for you, Marco,
[01:14:45.990 --> 01:14:48.390]  it says, Marco, do you manually weed
[01:14:48.390 --> 01:14:51.670]  or what is your strategy without spraying herbicides?
[01:14:53.230 --> 01:14:55.150]  That's a tough one, man.
[01:14:55.150 --> 01:14:58.630]  I actually, I paid someone to manually weed.
[01:14:59.830 --> 01:15:03.430]  Weeding, it's best when you can stay on top of it, man.
[01:15:03.430 --> 01:15:06.030]  Like I got my outdoor beds, I grow beds
[01:15:06.030 --> 01:15:09.750]  and I basically picture mounds on top of the soil,
[01:15:09.750 --> 01:15:11.790]  lower versions of hugel mounds.
[01:15:11.790 --> 01:15:13.950]  And the weeding's always rough.
[01:15:13.950 --> 01:15:17.870]  What I like to do is I like to, when I build those beds,
[01:15:17.870 --> 01:15:22.870]  I like to put my soil down, cardboard and wood chips.
[01:15:23.230 --> 01:15:26.230]  And that makes weeding a lot easier.
[01:15:26.230 --> 01:15:28.270]  And there's no way to say it, man.
[01:15:28.270 --> 01:15:30.430]  I have a bed right now, let it get out of hand
[01:15:30.430 --> 01:15:31.990]  and it just went nuts.
[01:15:31.990 --> 01:15:35.510]  So now I'm gonna have to rebuild that bed.
[01:15:35.510 --> 01:15:38.310]  So what I'm gonna do is all the grass has died.
[01:15:38.310 --> 01:15:41.270]  I'm gonna burn the grass just to get
[01:15:41.270 --> 01:15:43.150]  all the loose pieces down.
[01:15:43.150 --> 01:15:44.950]  Then I'm gonna go again with cardboard
[01:15:44.950 --> 01:15:45.910]  and I'm gonna go wood chips.
[01:15:45.910 --> 01:15:48.230]  And I'm gonna do that pretty soon before springtime
[01:15:48.230 --> 01:15:51.490]  because my hope is that I get a heavy enough layer
[01:15:51.490 --> 01:15:54.350]  on top of this stuff so those weeds that are down there now
[01:15:54.350 --> 01:15:56.630]  can hopefully die and don't come back.
[01:15:56.630 --> 01:15:59.670]  And any ones that fall in the top on the wood chip side
[01:15:59.670 --> 01:16:01.970]  should come out pretty easily.
[01:16:02.810 --> 01:16:05.730]  But yeah, weeding's just, it's just rough, man.
[01:16:05.730 --> 01:16:07.610]  A flame weeder works really nice too.
[01:16:07.610 --> 01:16:09.370]  Something you gotta stay on top of.
[01:16:10.610 --> 01:16:12.290]  Yeah, it'll get you a lot.
[01:16:12.290 --> 01:16:14.770]  There's a reason nobody likes weeding.
[01:16:14.770 --> 01:16:15.610]  I know, man.
[01:16:15.610 --> 01:16:17.850]  But no, I don't spray.
[01:16:17.850 --> 01:16:19.690]  I do everything I can not to spray.
[01:16:19.690 --> 01:16:23.490]  I've even tried like full strength vinegars.
[01:16:23.490 --> 01:16:24.970]  This shit doesn't really work
[01:16:24.970 --> 01:16:26.490]  on some of the Bermuda grasses.
[01:16:26.490 --> 01:16:29.650]  It'll work on some of the leafy grasses.
[01:16:29.650 --> 01:16:33.210]  I tried Bokashi Leachate, which was even more acidic
[01:16:33.210 --> 01:16:36.170]  than like your strongest vinegar.
[01:16:36.170 --> 01:16:39.850]  And still, man, weeds just kinda knocked them down
[01:16:39.850 --> 01:16:40.690]  and they came back.
[01:16:40.690 --> 01:16:43.210]  So I feel the only real way, man, is to smother them
[01:16:43.210 --> 01:16:45.290]  and then just try to keep smothering down
[01:16:45.290 --> 01:16:47.190]  and don't ever let them come back.
[01:16:48.850 --> 01:16:52.850]  All right, and here's part two of his questions.
[01:16:52.850 --> 01:16:54.170]  And this may be an easy question,
[01:16:54.170 --> 01:16:55.810]  but I'm not a person who's made this,
[01:16:55.810 --> 01:16:58.130]  so I'm curious myself.
[01:16:58.130 --> 01:17:00.530]  What's the easiest source of carbs or carbon
[01:17:00.530 --> 01:17:03.650]  to buy at the store for IMO 3?
[01:17:03.650 --> 01:17:05.530]  The easiest way, man, your friend,
[01:17:05.530 --> 01:17:09.050]  will be like a horse feed store, like tractor supply.
[01:17:09.050 --> 01:17:13.370]  The easiest way to do it, buy a 50 pound bag of cracked oats,
[01:17:13.370 --> 01:17:18.370]  a 50 pound bag of, there's like a mixed grains,
[01:17:18.610 --> 01:17:21.930]  cracked grains, and then get you some wood chips
[01:17:21.930 --> 01:17:25.350]  and then that water in with your natural farming inputs.
[01:17:25.350 --> 01:17:27.570]  But for me, that's an easy IMO.
[01:17:28.010 --> 01:17:29.130]  It's like 150 pounds.
[01:17:29.130 --> 01:17:33.290]  You got three, 50, 50, 50, and it works, it works.
[01:17:33.290 --> 01:17:34.490]  It makes a nice pile.
[01:17:35.850 --> 01:17:38.870]  If you wanna get cheaper using what you have,
[01:17:38.870 --> 01:17:40.250]  go collect some acorns,
[01:17:40.250 --> 01:17:42.810]  substitute one of your grains with the acorns
[01:17:43.970 --> 01:17:45.810]  and just kind of be creative.
[01:17:45.810 --> 01:17:47.410]  You know, IMO pile is really,
[01:17:47.410 --> 01:17:49.850]  you're just inoculating grains.
[01:17:49.850 --> 01:17:51.270]  You wanna have cracked grains
[01:17:51.270 --> 01:17:53.170]  because then that'll allow the inputs
[01:17:53.170 --> 01:17:56.930]  to kind of soak in really good and give you a good pile.
[01:17:58.570 --> 01:18:04.310]  I don't know if you had anything for that, Brian.
[01:18:04.310 --> 01:18:06.670]  Is that similar to what you're using as well
[01:18:06.670 --> 01:18:09.230]  or is that pretty common practice?
[01:18:09.230 --> 01:18:13.390]  Well, I'm usually buying IMO from guys like Marco.
[01:18:14.230 --> 01:18:18.630]  I'm definitely not at that same level as Marco.
[01:18:18.630 --> 01:18:21.950]  So usually if I'm, especially if like a lot of money
[01:18:21.950 --> 01:18:25.430]  is on the line, I just go out of my way to purchase stuff.
[01:18:26.270 --> 01:18:28.710]  And when it comes down to time,
[01:18:28.710 --> 01:18:30.830]  you know, it's really hard when you are a farmer
[01:18:30.830 --> 01:18:32.710]  to be able to create all these different things.
[01:18:32.710 --> 01:18:35.390]  So hats off to the ones that wanna make it.
[01:18:35.390 --> 01:18:36.950]  Yeah, yeah, it's not easy guys.
[01:18:36.950 --> 01:18:38.870]  And one thing that got me ahead of the game
[01:18:38.870 --> 01:18:42.950]  just as far as inputs is like, you know, I started my farm.
[01:18:42.950 --> 01:18:45.170]  Well, the first year I didn't do a lot.
[01:18:45.170 --> 01:18:48.390]  I was mostly just building kind of infrastructure
[01:18:48.390 --> 01:18:51.270]  and, you know, letting my roads develop
[01:18:51.270 --> 01:18:54.790]  and where the walking paths would be and making inputs.
[01:18:55.110 --> 01:18:58.590]  I spent a whole year making inputs for now.
[01:18:58.590 --> 01:19:00.550]  For now is the time I got my inputs.
[01:19:00.550 --> 01:19:01.670]  So now I can use them.
[01:19:02.610 --> 01:19:05.270]  Yeah, definitely start making your inputs, man.
[01:19:05.270 --> 01:19:07.110]  Because like Brian says, that's your time.
[01:19:07.110 --> 01:19:08.550]  That saves you your time.
[01:19:08.550 --> 01:19:11.390]  And if you can't make them, reach out to other folks.
[01:19:11.390 --> 01:19:13.910]  Shout out to Red Dirt in Oklahoma.
[01:19:13.910 --> 01:19:18.670]  I sent them some IMO3 to inoculate their beds.
[01:19:18.670 --> 01:19:20.710]  I'm wishing them the best
[01:19:20.710 --> 01:19:22.710]  with what they're doing out there.
[01:19:22.710 --> 01:19:24.810]  Hit me up if you got any problems, James.
[01:19:27.830 --> 01:19:29.950]  And then big ups to chat too, man.
[01:19:29.950 --> 01:19:32.390]  I'm kind of scrolling through it
[01:19:32.390 --> 01:19:34.370]  and I'm pausing as I get to a question.
[01:19:34.370 --> 01:19:37.350]  So I'm not current with the comments.
[01:19:37.350 --> 01:19:38.630]  I'm getting down to them
[01:19:38.630 --> 01:19:40.670]  because I don't wanna go by some of these good comments.
[01:19:40.670 --> 01:19:42.510]  But I'm seeing nematodes, nematodes.
[01:19:42.510 --> 01:19:44.530]  And I'm like, I must be at the fungus nat section
[01:19:44.530 --> 01:19:45.370]  of the show.
[01:19:45.370 --> 01:19:47.590]  So I totally am.
[01:19:47.590 --> 01:19:49.390]  So I'm doing that.
[01:19:49.390 --> 01:19:52.070]  But so a lot of good questions in here.
[01:19:52.750 --> 01:19:55.510]  And actually here's one that I am wondering
[01:19:55.510 --> 01:19:57.090]  and battling with myself.
[01:19:57.090 --> 01:19:59.370]  So thank you, Dalton Cook for asking this.
[01:20:01.510 --> 01:20:03.290]  I have a perpetual grow.
[01:20:03.290 --> 01:20:06.550]  I have a flower and I have a veg.
[01:20:06.550 --> 01:20:09.670]  They don't, you know, it's not full run in either or.
[01:20:09.670 --> 01:20:11.470]  It's I'm moving into.
[01:20:11.470 --> 01:20:15.110]  How do you handle that with a living soil bed?
[01:20:15.110 --> 01:20:16.110]  How do you do that?
[01:20:16.110 --> 01:20:18.570]  Are you doing little pots
[01:20:18.570 --> 01:20:20.790]  and then putting them into the soil?
[01:20:20.830 --> 01:20:23.510]  You can't really dig up a root ball.
[01:20:23.510 --> 01:20:26.090]  Okay, so he's doing perpetual in the sense
[01:20:26.090 --> 01:20:29.350]  that he just wants to keep having a harvest every month,
[01:20:29.350 --> 01:20:31.670]  I guess, back to back.
[01:20:31.670 --> 01:20:32.510]  Okay.
[01:20:33.950 --> 01:20:36.630]  Well, what I used to do,
[01:20:36.630 --> 01:20:38.310]  I'm gonna lead up to what I,
[01:20:38.310 --> 01:20:39.950]  if you wanna try to be perpetual now.
[01:20:39.950 --> 01:20:41.350]  But what I would used to do in my,
[01:20:41.350 --> 01:20:43.590]  in a picture of four by eight,
[01:20:43.590 --> 01:20:47.430]  I would do three, this was an aeroponics days.
[01:20:47.430 --> 01:20:51.110]  And if you picture there was fence posts with the net pots,
[01:20:51.110 --> 01:20:52.310]  I wanted to be perpetual
[01:20:52.310 --> 01:20:54.510]  because I always wanted to have something come
[01:20:54.510 --> 01:20:56.350]  kind of every three to four weeks.
[01:20:56.350 --> 01:21:00.750]  So what I would do is I would start one fence post today
[01:21:00.750 --> 01:21:03.110]  and three weeks I'd start my next fence post
[01:21:03.110 --> 01:21:05.470]  and then three weeks I'll start my next one.
[01:21:05.470 --> 01:21:07.350]  And then that would just give me a rotation.
[01:21:07.350 --> 01:21:08.470]  But once they got going,
[01:21:08.470 --> 01:21:11.710]  I was getting a harvest just out of that small space.
[01:21:11.710 --> 01:21:15.630]  It was perpetual, but it kept me, kept things going.
[01:21:15.630 --> 01:21:18.830]  I thought about doing it in like a living soil too,
[01:21:20.230 --> 01:21:22.590]  but I think that,
[01:21:22.590 --> 01:21:25.250]  I don't think that I would like the way,
[01:21:26.670 --> 01:21:28.910]  I don't think that you staggered a plants like that.
[01:21:28.910 --> 01:21:30.750]  I don't know that I could do a row,
[01:21:30.750 --> 01:21:32.990]  two plants in a four by four,
[01:21:32.990 --> 01:21:34.710]  two plants this week and three weeks
[01:21:34.710 --> 01:21:37.390]  do two more in the middle and I do three more,
[01:21:37.390 --> 01:21:38.630]  do two more in three weeks
[01:21:38.630 --> 01:21:41.110]  because it just wouldn't work that way.
[01:21:41.110 --> 01:21:43.750]  So to me, to do perpetual,
[01:21:43.750 --> 01:21:46.390]  I would do, if you want something every three weeks
[01:21:46.390 --> 01:21:48.390]  or four weeks, you need three beds.
[01:21:48.390 --> 01:21:52.110]  You need to go bed, then bed two, then bed three.
[01:21:52.110 --> 01:21:54.190]  That's probably your best way to do it.
[01:21:55.030 --> 01:21:56.430]  Yeah, that's exactly what I was gonna say.
[01:21:56.430 --> 01:21:57.870]  Like, especially in the commercial setting.
[01:21:57.870 --> 01:22:00.230]  So you have your one room that's gonna finish this week,
[01:22:00.230 --> 01:22:02.350]  then you have your other room that's going to finish
[01:22:02.350 --> 01:22:05.950]  and you have your one bedroom that's supplying all of those.
[01:22:05.950 --> 01:22:08.670]  That's how you do a perpetual harvest
[01:22:08.670 --> 01:22:09.970]  with a living soil system.
[01:22:10.890 --> 01:22:12.170]  Cool.
[01:22:12.170 --> 01:22:13.010]  Okay, cool.
[01:22:13.010 --> 01:22:16.610]  So it's more of like three rooms versus two
[01:22:16.610 --> 01:22:20.450]  because again, the veg, I like to harvest every two months.
[01:22:21.410 --> 01:22:24.130]  So that means I have them ready to go into flower,
[01:22:24.130 --> 01:22:25.210]  always ready to go into flower.
[01:22:25.210 --> 01:22:29.450]  And if I have that one main veg tent,
[01:22:29.450 --> 01:22:32.690]  then every month I could farm one out to each tent.
[01:22:32.690 --> 01:22:33.530]  Exactly.
[01:22:33.530 --> 01:22:34.370]  To keep them going.
[01:22:34.370 --> 01:22:36.130]  Because for me, it is kind of also a balance
[01:22:36.130 --> 01:22:38.770]  of keeping certain strains going.
[01:22:39.490 --> 01:22:43.530]  I have to have that veg area because I am cloning.
[01:22:43.530 --> 01:22:44.890]  So what you're gonna end up doing
[01:22:44.890 --> 01:22:47.250]  is probably having just a mother place
[01:22:47.250 --> 01:22:49.790]  where your sacred genetics rest.
[01:22:51.610 --> 01:22:54.530]  Because some people just keep, clone, cut.
[01:22:54.530 --> 01:22:55.850]  Now this is my next one, cut.
[01:22:55.850 --> 01:22:56.790]  Never keep a mother.
[01:22:56.790 --> 01:22:59.050]  You can do that, but it gets a little risky.
[01:23:00.930 --> 01:23:03.850]  Kind of didn't root like you want it to or something.
[01:23:03.850 --> 01:23:05.370]  But yeah, I like that idea.
[01:23:05.370 --> 01:23:08.650]  If you want every two months, two flower tents,
[01:23:09.530 --> 01:23:12.850]  and then your veg, and then let the veg just burn it,
[01:23:12.850 --> 01:23:14.250]  supply them.
[01:23:14.250 --> 01:23:15.410]  And then the larger facilities,
[01:23:15.410 --> 01:23:17.290]  we didn't even use mother plants anymore.
[01:23:17.290 --> 01:23:20.810]  We would just make sure that we always had clones rocking.
[01:23:20.810 --> 01:23:23.170]  We noticed that once the mothers would get
[01:23:23.170 --> 01:23:26.330]  like a woodier stem, a woodier stalk,
[01:23:26.330 --> 01:23:27.790]  the genetics would degrade.
[01:23:29.130 --> 01:23:32.730]  Dedegregation, I think a lot of people could,
[01:23:32.730 --> 01:23:35.490]  we could talk about that on probably a whole show.
[01:23:35.490 --> 01:23:37.570]  But it does seem like for a plant
[01:23:37.570 --> 01:23:39.250]  that is supposed to die,
[01:23:40.330 --> 01:23:42.370]  if you're keeping it around for years and years,
[01:23:42.370 --> 01:23:44.770]  it just seems like it adds a bunch of pest problems.
[01:23:44.770 --> 01:23:46.490]  And the genetics, for whatever reason,
[01:23:46.490 --> 01:23:48.050]  seem to get weaker over time.
[01:23:49.170 --> 01:23:50.970]  Yeah, there used to be talks about that.
[01:23:50.970 --> 01:23:53.550]  And I gotta dig back in my memory banks.
[01:23:53.550 --> 01:23:56.930]  Like, is it more degrading to clone, clone, clone, clone,
[01:23:56.930 --> 01:23:59.410]  clone, or is it more degrading to let that mother sit?
[01:23:59.410 --> 01:24:01.210]  And I think like you said, Brian,
[01:24:01.210 --> 01:24:04.450]  last thing I read was kind of the mother thing.
[01:24:04.450 --> 01:24:06.650]  They kind of expire, it seems like.
[01:24:06.650 --> 01:24:07.930]  And when you take that new cut,
[01:24:07.930 --> 01:24:10.050]  you're kind of fresh again, fresh.
[01:24:11.210 --> 01:24:14.810]  There was a recent paper that Matthew Gates
[01:24:14.810 --> 01:24:18.650]  had actually published, or not published, he put up.
[01:24:18.650 --> 01:24:21.850]  Christian Adamek was the author.
[01:24:21.850 --> 01:24:24.950]  And it was somatic mutations in cannabis.
[01:24:24.950 --> 01:24:29.950]  And it specifically addressed this issue of genetic drift.
[01:24:30.570 --> 01:24:31.610]  What is genetic drift?
[01:24:31.610 --> 01:24:32.430]  Is that real?
[01:24:32.430 --> 01:24:34.190]  Is it because of a sick mom?
[01:24:34.190 --> 01:24:37.910]  And his study, again, this just came out not too long ago.
[01:24:37.910 --> 01:24:42.910]  There is an episode up on FCP02 of us discussing this.
[01:24:43.990 --> 01:24:47.870]  But yeah, there are little mutations as you take clones.
[01:24:47.870 --> 01:24:50.230]  And you tend to get more from the top of the plant
[01:24:50.230 --> 01:24:51.950]  versus the bottom of the plant.
[01:24:51.950 --> 01:24:56.170]  Whether these mutations are anything of significance,
[01:24:56.170 --> 01:24:58.230]  that's still to be seen.
[01:24:58.230 --> 01:25:02.910]  But to get closer on the answer of genetic drift,
[01:25:02.910 --> 01:25:06.230]  yeah, there has been a little bit of new research on there.
[01:25:06.230 --> 01:25:07.350]  So that's a fascinating one.
[01:25:07.350 --> 01:25:10.070]  Again, Christian Adamek is the author.
[01:25:10.070 --> 01:25:12.390]  Somatic mutations in cannabis is a quick way
[01:25:12.390 --> 01:25:14.790]  to probably Google that and find it,
[01:25:14.790 --> 01:25:17.370]  or just go back and catch the episode here.
[01:25:18.870 --> 01:25:19.710]  Yeah, I gotta check that.
[01:25:19.710 --> 01:25:21.390]  I remember you guys had that episode.
[01:25:21.390 --> 01:25:22.990]  I gotta check that one, man.
[01:25:22.990 --> 01:25:23.830]  And let's be fair.
[01:25:23.830 --> 01:25:27.030]  I mean, there's very few people that are cannabis farmers
[01:25:27.030 --> 01:25:28.150]  that seem like they're able
[01:25:28.150 --> 01:25:30.990]  to keep a mother extremely healthy.
[01:25:30.990 --> 01:25:32.870]  Most of the time when you walk into somebody's room
[01:25:33.710 --> 01:25:34.550]  where there's a bunch of mothers,
[01:25:34.550 --> 01:25:35.630]  the plants look hacked to hell,
[01:25:35.630 --> 01:25:37.510]  and they just look haggard and old.
[01:25:37.510 --> 01:25:40.830]  So, you know, and then a lot of people
[01:25:40.830 --> 01:25:41.870]  still wanna farm that way.
[01:25:41.870 --> 01:25:44.510]  I'm not saying one way is probably better than the other.
[01:25:44.510 --> 01:25:45.350]  It just seems like,
[01:25:45.350 --> 01:25:46.990]  especially when you're on a commercial facility
[01:25:46.990 --> 01:25:49.430]  and you're just constantly taking clones,
[01:25:49.430 --> 01:25:52.430]  it's better to have like a more of a perpetual
[01:25:52.430 --> 01:25:55.710]  cloning process than just hacking mother plants.
[01:25:57.230 --> 01:25:59.930]  And here's a question.
[01:25:59.930 --> 01:26:01.910]  I'm assuming the answer would be yes,
[01:26:01.950 --> 01:26:04.350]  but how would you do that?
[01:26:04.350 --> 01:26:06.590]  Or what would you use?
[01:26:06.590 --> 01:26:08.190]  Any need to treat living soil
[01:26:08.190 --> 01:26:09.830]  after about with russet mites?
[01:26:10.830 --> 01:26:13.050]  Yeah, you're going to, from that day on,
[01:26:13.050 --> 01:26:15.070]  always assume that you have russet mites.
[01:26:15.070 --> 01:26:17.810]  And so your IPM protocols are gonna be on point
[01:26:17.810 --> 01:26:21.030]  that you have a russet mite problem.
[01:26:21.030 --> 01:26:21.990]  Because if you don't,
[01:26:21.990 --> 01:26:24.430]  there's going to be a little pocket that you didn't see
[01:26:24.430 --> 01:26:26.950]  or your team didn't see, and it's going to take off.
[01:26:26.950 --> 01:26:30.870]  Russet mites are the holy grail of,
[01:26:30.870 --> 01:26:34.030]  oh my God, I could be fucked.
[01:26:34.030 --> 01:26:36.750]  I feel like spider mites, when we first were starting out,
[01:26:36.750 --> 01:26:38.470]  that was where it was at.
[01:26:38.470 --> 01:26:39.870]  Then we figured out how to do that.
[01:26:39.870 --> 01:26:42.230]  And then once russet mites came through,
[01:26:42.230 --> 01:26:44.470]  it's until you have that trained eye
[01:26:44.470 --> 01:26:46.430]  and you see that little like bronze coloring
[01:26:46.430 --> 01:26:48.150]  coming off the plant,
[01:26:48.150 --> 01:26:50.630]  you're going to probably think that it's a deficiency,
[01:26:50.630 --> 01:26:52.730]  like we were mentioning before.
[01:26:52.730 --> 01:26:55.350]  So once you have russet mites in a living soil system,
[01:26:55.350 --> 01:26:58.350]  you have to kind of focus and realize that from now on,
[01:26:58.430 --> 01:27:01.030]  I'm going to always assume that I have russet mites
[01:27:01.030 --> 01:27:02.150]  and plant accordingly.
[01:27:03.390 --> 01:27:04.550]  Yeah, I see.
[01:27:04.550 --> 01:27:06.110]  Yeah, there's a few different predators.
[01:27:06.110 --> 01:27:09.390]  They actually tell you to go for a cocktail
[01:27:09.390 --> 01:27:10.990]  when you're fighting russets.
[01:27:10.990 --> 01:27:12.270]  They're so nasty.
[01:27:12.270 --> 01:27:15.550]  Cucumaris, swirsky eye, andersoni.
[01:27:15.550 --> 01:27:16.630]  There's like five of them.
[01:27:16.630 --> 01:27:19.910]  Look for some of those beneficial suppliers online
[01:27:19.910 --> 01:27:21.510]  when you guys have issues.
[01:27:21.510 --> 01:27:22.990]  And like for a lot of things,
[01:27:22.990 --> 01:27:24.870]  you can't just hit them with one thing.
[01:27:24.870 --> 01:27:26.070]  It's like multiples.
[01:27:26.350 --> 01:27:29.190]  You want to just really hit it and knock it out.
[01:27:29.190 --> 01:27:31.490]  Like if a buddy of mine had aphids,
[01:27:31.490 --> 01:27:33.430]  we hit them with two beneficials,
[01:27:33.430 --> 01:27:38.150]  a pirate bug, my new pirate bug, and cucumaris.
[01:27:38.150 --> 01:27:41.350]  And then we also hit them with,
[01:27:41.350 --> 01:27:43.870]  I hit them with a jadam sulfur spray
[01:27:44.850 --> 01:27:46.150]  along with the wetting agent.
[01:27:46.150 --> 01:27:49.110]  So that combination, you want to hit,
[01:27:49.110 --> 01:27:51.670]  if you're in a fight, man, there's no rules.
[01:27:51.670 --> 01:27:54.850]  The fight is, the rule is don't get your ass beat.
[01:27:54.850 --> 01:27:57.690]  So you got to do what you got to do.
[01:27:57.690 --> 01:27:59.450]  You got to hit it IPM.
[01:27:59.450 --> 01:28:00.930]  You got to hit it predators.
[01:28:00.930 --> 01:28:02.250]  You got to hit it with spray.
[01:28:02.250 --> 01:28:04.050]  Do what you got to do to kind of eliminate that.
[01:28:04.050 --> 01:28:05.970]  Because ultimately that predator's
[01:28:05.970 --> 01:28:07.690]  trying to take food off your table.
[01:28:07.690 --> 01:28:08.530]  You know what I mean?
[01:28:08.530 --> 01:28:09.350]  So it's a fight.
[01:28:13.400 --> 01:28:17.880]  I see some people in chat mentioning Dr. Bruce Bugbee.
[01:28:17.880 --> 01:28:22.200]  Bugbee was on Mr. Grow It shows past weekend.
[01:28:22.200 --> 01:28:26.700]  And this is again where I'm getting some of the questions
[01:28:27.540 --> 01:28:28.380]  for today.
[01:28:28.380 --> 01:28:32.980]  There's a lot of talk that obviously synthetics
[01:28:32.980 --> 01:28:35.140]  are going to kill microbes.
[01:28:35.140 --> 01:28:39.340]  He tends to have this belief that no,
[01:28:39.340 --> 01:28:41.420]  you may damage them maybe,
[01:28:41.420 --> 01:28:44.860]  but you can still run with microbes in a synthetic system.
[01:28:44.860 --> 01:28:47.960]  So instead of debating that a yes or no,
[01:28:47.960 --> 01:28:50.380]  because we probably don't have the answer,
[01:28:50.380 --> 01:28:53.580]  how would somebody go about finding that answer?
[01:28:53.580 --> 01:28:58.220]  Is it as simple as looking at the microbes on a slide
[01:28:58.220 --> 01:29:00.900]  in an organic soil versus a synthetically?
[01:29:00.900 --> 01:29:03.940]  And you start with the same inoculation.
[01:29:03.940 --> 01:29:05.940]  You give it the same conditions.
[01:29:05.940 --> 01:29:09.560]  You check the colonies, you apply your nutrients,
[01:29:09.560 --> 01:29:10.740]  and then you check again.
[01:29:10.740 --> 01:29:14.300]  Is that how somebody would get the answer to this question?
[01:29:14.300 --> 01:29:17.420]  I think it could be as simple as literally Chad.
[01:29:17.420 --> 01:29:21.940]  So I'll take a handful or two handfuls on my soil.
[01:29:21.940 --> 01:29:25.500]  Not a handful, but small part amount of soil.
[01:29:25.500 --> 01:29:29.260]  Let's make that solution he runs, run it through there.
[01:29:30.140 --> 01:29:32.820]  Before you check your microbes on a slide
[01:29:32.820 --> 01:29:34.140]  before you run that,
[01:29:34.140 --> 01:29:37.420]  and check it on a slide a few hours after you run that.
[01:29:37.420 --> 01:29:38.260]  You know what I mean?
[01:29:38.260 --> 01:29:40.740]  And I think that will probably give you a lot.
[01:29:40.740 --> 01:29:42.900]  I'm sure that you won't see complete death
[01:29:42.900 --> 01:29:45.220]  and destruction on a slide obviously,
[01:29:46.120 --> 01:29:48.980]  but I'm sure you have your microbes diminished.
[01:29:48.980 --> 01:29:53.700]  And just like when you're growing, you're growing trichomes.
[01:29:53.700 --> 01:29:54.820]  You're growing microbes.
[01:29:54.820 --> 01:29:57.820]  Why would you do anything that could possibly diminish
[01:29:57.820 --> 01:29:59.020]  the thing you're growing?
[01:29:59.020 --> 01:30:02.420]  Like to me, then why is it worth the risk?
[01:30:02.420 --> 01:30:03.820]  You know, I don't know.
[01:30:03.820 --> 01:30:05.700]  Good, excellent point.
[01:30:05.700 --> 01:30:08.980]  And that's another thing that he didn't necessarily quantify
[01:30:08.980 --> 01:30:10.860]  is sometimes you can be like,
[01:30:10.860 --> 01:30:14.580]  if you had a thousand and you still only have two,
[01:30:14.580 --> 01:30:16.020]  well, you still have microbes.
[01:30:16.020 --> 01:30:17.140]  That is plural.
[01:30:17.140 --> 01:30:20.300]  So to, yeah, I guess, you know, again, you do,
[01:30:20.300 --> 01:30:22.220]  that needs to be quantified.
[01:30:23.260 --> 01:30:26.260]  What percentage of microbial activity do you have
[01:30:26.260 --> 01:30:28.140]  compared to the living soil
[01:30:28.140 --> 01:30:31.500]  after an application of synthetics?
[01:30:31.500 --> 01:30:32.340]  Exactly.
[01:30:32.340 --> 01:30:34.220]  And then also Chad, think about it like this.
[01:30:34.220 --> 01:30:36.320]  That is, that's very, yes, very true.
[01:30:36.320 --> 01:30:38.620]  So also think about it like this.
[01:30:39.900 --> 01:30:42.380]  With our soil, we depend on our microbes
[01:30:42.380 --> 01:30:43.620]  to cycle those nutrients.
[01:30:43.620 --> 01:30:46.580]  With his way of growing,
[01:30:46.980 --> 01:30:50.300]  he's going synthetics straight from bottle to plant root.
[01:30:50.300 --> 01:30:52.060]  So he doesn't really,
[01:30:52.060 --> 01:30:54.900]  he's not even really wanting the step of the microbes to me.
[01:30:54.900 --> 01:30:57.360]  I don't know where they're really benefiting him.
[01:30:57.360 --> 01:30:59.420]  I'm not gonna say that, listen,
[01:30:59.420 --> 01:31:01.200]  don't give me the hate mail.
[01:31:02.220 --> 01:31:05.020]  You know, so I just feel like you're diminishing
[01:31:05.020 --> 01:31:06.860]  the thing that you're trying to grow.
[01:31:08.860 --> 01:31:10.060]  And that makes absolute sense,
[01:31:10.060 --> 01:31:12.260]  especially the way you put it with the trichomes.
[01:31:12.260 --> 01:31:15.460]  Again, you know, a lot of us cringe
[01:31:15.460 --> 01:31:17.860]  every time somebody reaches in and grabs a bud
[01:31:17.860 --> 01:31:20.260]  and sniffs it and rubs it around their nose.
[01:31:20.260 --> 01:31:21.940]  We all want to do that.
[01:31:21.940 --> 01:31:25.620]  We've all done that, but we know a little bit better.
[01:31:25.620 --> 01:31:27.300]  That's what we're growing.
[01:31:27.300 --> 01:31:30.180]  And we're just wasting our time by breaking that off.
[01:31:30.180 --> 01:31:31.720]  Exactly, exactly.
[01:31:32.540 --> 01:31:35.220]  Can I, Mike Ragoon, he's one of my buddies.
[01:31:35.220 --> 01:31:38.260]  He wants to touch on the burlap sack IMO.
[01:31:38.260 --> 01:31:39.100]  Yeah.
[01:31:39.100 --> 01:31:40.340]  Yeah, that's a pretty cool,
[01:31:40.340 --> 01:31:42.500]  that's easy way to do it, man.
[01:31:42.500 --> 01:31:44.400]  Like when you make an IMO pile,
[01:31:44.400 --> 01:31:47.640]  part of the process is, you know, building the pile
[01:31:47.640 --> 01:31:50.120]  and then turning it to keep the temperature in a zone
[01:31:50.120 --> 01:31:54.720]  and just nurturing it and seeing it through
[01:31:54.720 --> 01:31:56.840]  until it cools down.
[01:31:56.840 --> 01:32:00.040]  One thing I like to do is I'll do kind of a very similar
[01:32:00.040 --> 01:32:04.000]  to making an IMO pile, but then put it in burlap sacks
[01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:06.920]  and stack those sacks in a box on the ground,
[01:32:06.920 --> 01:32:09.820]  a cardboard box, and you know, not in the rain.
[01:32:10.680 --> 01:32:12.160]  And what you're doing is you're just letting
[01:32:12.160 --> 01:32:16.640]  the microbiology just break down that and make that IMO
[01:32:16.640 --> 01:32:18.720]  without you having to turn it.
[01:32:18.720 --> 01:32:20.680]  It's a little bit longer process.
[01:32:20.680 --> 01:32:22.920]  It makes some really great stuff.
[01:32:22.920 --> 01:32:25.960]  My buddy, OKC Calix, he's running that.
[01:32:25.960 --> 01:32:28.040]  We had him on the show before.
[01:32:28.040 --> 01:32:32.600]  He took my little IMO, acorn IMO, and he ran with it
[01:32:32.600 --> 01:32:35.320]  and he's doing some pretty cool stuff with it.
[01:32:35.320 --> 01:32:37.920]  But yeah, what it is, it's just like a no turn compost.
[01:32:37.920 --> 01:32:39.600]  It's like a static pile.
[01:32:39.920 --> 01:32:42.480]  And what that is, it's just letting the microbiology
[01:32:42.480 --> 01:32:44.640]  work for you and you don't have to do much.
[01:32:45.600 --> 01:32:49.880]  I would add too, like when you're doing synthetic microbes,
[01:32:49.880 --> 01:32:52.760]  you constantly have to be adding them from what I understand
[01:32:52.760 --> 01:32:54.360]  where with a living soil system,
[01:32:54.360 --> 01:32:55.600]  once everything's up and running,
[01:32:55.600 --> 01:32:58.200]  that's what we mean by alive and thriving.
[01:32:58.200 --> 01:32:59.840]  Now we're just managing the system
[01:32:59.840 --> 01:33:01.480]  where on the synthetic side of things,
[01:33:01.480 --> 01:33:06.080]  the plant is so dependent on you that you're,
[01:33:06.080 --> 01:33:07.400]  especially if you're first starting out,
[01:33:07.400 --> 01:33:08.580]  you're going to make mistakes.
[01:33:08.580 --> 01:33:11.260]  And that's why so many living soil farmers
[01:33:11.260 --> 01:33:14.660]  love to show their entire grow with no deficiencies
[01:33:14.660 --> 01:33:16.760]  because those microbes are breaking everything down,
[01:33:16.760 --> 01:33:18.660]  feeding the plant constantly,
[01:33:18.660 --> 01:33:21.180]  where on a synthetic side of things,
[01:33:21.180 --> 01:33:23.620]  usually those plants are feeding when you decide.
[01:33:25.820 --> 01:33:28.300]  Yeah, well said, great point to add, Brian.
[01:33:28.300 --> 01:33:29.180]  Very true.
[01:33:29.180 --> 01:33:33.580]  And I know we touched on the wood chips earlier for a mulch,
[01:33:33.580 --> 01:33:35.820]  but plastic sheet mulch.
[01:33:36.660 --> 01:33:40.380]  I know in the field trials with WSU,
[01:33:42.260 --> 01:33:43.980]  we had a whole bunch of different rows
[01:33:43.980 --> 01:33:47.780]  and a whole bunch of different ideas to keep weeds out.
[01:33:47.780 --> 01:33:50.620]  Nature wins, that's the short story.
[01:33:50.620 --> 01:33:53.940]  But how do you guys feel about the plastic sheet mulching?
[01:33:53.940 --> 01:33:57.780]  Nature wins and plastic sheet mulch always comes up
[01:33:57.780 --> 01:34:01.740]  or always just turns into a mess or even weed block.
[01:34:01.740 --> 01:34:02.860]  I've tried it all, man.
[01:34:02.860 --> 01:34:04.780]  To me, cardboard is your key
[01:34:04.780 --> 01:34:08.060]  because even if all of those shit,
[01:34:08.060 --> 01:34:10.620]  it's just cardboard, it's going back to the earth.
[01:34:10.620 --> 01:34:12.740]  When you put down a hundred feet of weed,
[01:34:12.740 --> 01:34:14.400]  blocker, reed roller,
[01:34:14.400 --> 01:34:16.500]  now you got an impact on the environment
[01:34:16.500 --> 01:34:17.780]  trying to get it back up,
[01:34:17.780 --> 01:34:20.180]  or do you leave it for the next generation,
[01:34:20.180 --> 01:34:21.580]  or does this guy dig it up?
[01:34:21.580 --> 01:34:23.900]  So I like the cardboard, man.
[01:34:23.900 --> 01:34:26.200]  To me, cardboard, wood chips, keep it natural.
[01:34:26.200 --> 01:34:29.580]  Even leaves are great for keeping the weeds down.
[01:34:29.580 --> 01:34:32.060]  It's a tough fight and it's not easy if it was,
[01:34:32.060 --> 01:34:34.540]  you know, everybody be gardening.
[01:34:37.180 --> 01:34:40.060]  Yeah, I don't think plastic's the way to go for that at all.
[01:34:40.060 --> 01:34:43.780]  Especially if you're really trying to be a natural farmer,
[01:34:43.780 --> 01:34:45.820]  conscious of your environment,
[01:34:45.820 --> 01:34:47.540]  wanting to improve things over time,
[01:34:47.540 --> 01:34:49.580]  then that's just not the way to go.
[01:34:49.580 --> 01:34:53.060]  Yeah, the paper is probably published by now,
[01:34:53.060 --> 01:34:54.940]  but one of the things they were working on
[01:34:54.940 --> 01:34:56.660]  at the Mount Vernon extension
[01:34:58.300 --> 01:35:01.740]  was the biodegradable plastic
[01:35:01.740 --> 01:35:04.020]  because like strawberries are big around here.
[01:35:04.020 --> 01:35:05.180]  We've got a lot of crops
[01:35:05.220 --> 01:35:07.340]  where you need to keep that soil warm
[01:35:07.340 --> 01:35:08.860]  in the beginning of the season to plant,
[01:35:08.860 --> 01:35:10.240]  and that is the thing.
[01:35:11.940 --> 01:35:14.460]  You know, again, I'll have to go back and read the paper,
[01:35:14.460 --> 01:35:16.860]  but my overall impression is it's kind of like
[01:35:16.860 --> 01:35:19.300]  when you had the oil spills in the Gulf,
[01:35:19.300 --> 01:35:23.540]  they put something on it to disperse it
[01:35:23.540 --> 01:35:26.460]  to where visually we couldn't see it anymore,
[01:35:26.460 --> 01:35:28.420]  but that didn't mean it was gone.
[01:35:28.420 --> 01:35:30.980]  Correct, that's right, that's right.
[01:35:30.980 --> 01:35:32.540]  I kind of think that's how
[01:35:32.540 --> 01:35:36.500]  that biodegradable plastic mulch is.
[01:35:36.500 --> 01:35:38.300]  I guess if I had one more thing to say,
[01:35:38.300 --> 01:35:40.220]  I would say, man, if you're gonna try
[01:35:40.220 --> 01:35:41.460]  to use something like that,
[01:35:41.460 --> 01:35:44.060]  or if it's a necessity like Chad said,
[01:35:44.060 --> 01:35:49.060]  there are the woven type fabrics, weed blockers.
[01:35:49.460 --> 01:35:51.060]  Well, reuse them, you know?
[01:35:51.060 --> 01:35:53.540]  Don't just use it once at the end of the season.
[01:35:53.540 --> 01:35:55.540]  Roll it, knock the dust off of it,
[01:35:55.540 --> 01:35:58.460]  roll it back up, and then use it again next year, you know?
[01:35:58.460 --> 01:35:59.980]  The wasteful part is when you're just
[01:35:59.980 --> 01:36:02.100]  throwing stuff like that away.
[01:36:02.900 --> 01:36:04.660]  Yeah, yeah, time after time.
[01:36:06.300 --> 01:36:10.100]  And this is kind of a generic question,
[01:36:10.100 --> 01:36:12.380]  not necessarily anything organic about it.
[01:36:12.380 --> 01:36:14.620]  I don't know how you could make it more
[01:36:14.620 --> 01:36:16.940]  of an organic process versus not,
[01:36:16.940 --> 01:36:21.940]  but is there any one tip that you guys have for drying,
[01:36:22.260 --> 01:36:25.020]  and I'm gonna say on scale,
[01:36:25.020 --> 01:36:27.780]  because on scale is gonna be different than your tent.
[01:36:28.140 --> 01:36:31.140]  Any one little gem that you can offer?
[01:36:31.140 --> 01:36:33.580]  Your facility needs a drying and curing room.
[01:36:33.580 --> 01:36:35.180]  So many facilities out there,
[01:36:35.180 --> 01:36:37.100]  even if you're a basement grower,
[01:36:37.100 --> 01:36:39.100]  you need some kind of like closet or something
[01:36:39.100 --> 01:36:40.660]  where that is just all that you do,
[01:36:40.660 --> 01:36:42.180]  and you dial in that environment,
[01:36:42.180 --> 01:36:44.180]  and that's how you're going to really
[01:36:44.180 --> 01:36:46.620]  take your cannabis to the next level.
[01:36:46.620 --> 01:36:47.780]  Because so many people,
[01:36:47.780 --> 01:36:49.460]  especially on the commercial side of things,
[01:36:49.460 --> 01:36:51.380]  they rush through that so much.
[01:36:51.380 --> 01:36:52.860]  You put all this time and effort,
[01:36:52.860 --> 01:36:54.180]  and then just a few more weeks,
[01:36:54.180 --> 01:36:56.100]  if they would just put that time and effort into it,
[01:36:56.140 --> 01:36:59.220]  their cannabis would just be on a whole nother level.
[01:36:59.220 --> 01:37:02.140]  And I really feel like there's an art form to that.
[01:37:02.140 --> 01:37:05.220]  So if you're really trying to get into it,
[01:37:05.220 --> 01:37:07.740]  I also think that you need to be curing in glass,
[01:37:07.740 --> 01:37:10.140]  and I see a lot of people still to this day,
[01:37:10.140 --> 01:37:12.460]  even commercial facilities here in Colorado,
[01:37:12.460 --> 01:37:15.180]  curing in what we used to call turkey bags.
[01:37:16.300 --> 01:37:17.140]  Yep.
[01:37:17.140 --> 01:37:18.940]  Yeah, well said.
[01:37:18.940 --> 01:37:22.900]  Definitely a purpose-built room
[01:37:22.900 --> 01:37:24.340]  that you can control the humidity
[01:37:24.380 --> 01:37:25.220]  and temperature.
[01:37:25.220 --> 01:37:28.300]  I think, I don't know if this is industry standard,
[01:37:28.300 --> 01:37:33.300]  but a roughly 60 degrees, 60% humidity.
[01:37:33.300 --> 01:37:35.940]  That's pretty close to what everybody does.
[01:37:37.260 --> 01:37:39.500]  And then one thing to think about,
[01:37:39.500 --> 01:37:40.620]  especially on commercial,
[01:37:40.620 --> 01:37:42.220]  because I've seen it firsthand,
[01:37:42.220 --> 01:37:46.940]  is that a lot of folks don't build a big enough dry room
[01:37:46.940 --> 01:37:48.540]  and cure room starting out.
[01:37:49.540 --> 01:37:52.100]  Everyone's so focused on the production rooms.
[01:37:52.220 --> 01:37:54.020]  I was dealt with a facility,
[01:37:54.020 --> 01:37:55.580]  they had 10 rooms, right?
[01:37:55.580 --> 01:37:59.820]  Picture, so 10 of their rooms are X size, right?
[01:37:59.820 --> 01:38:03.380]  Their dry room was like one 10th of X.
[01:38:03.380 --> 01:38:07.100]  So it was like the math just doesn't work out, guys.
[01:38:07.100 --> 01:38:09.820]  You gotta think about it, think ahead,
[01:38:09.820 --> 01:38:11.860]  because the time to figure out
[01:38:11.860 --> 01:38:13.180]  how you're gonna dry all this
[01:38:13.180 --> 01:38:15.860]  is not when it's time to dry all this.
[01:38:15.860 --> 01:38:19.180]  So what Brian said was key, purpose-built rooms,
[01:38:19.620 --> 01:38:21.900]  slow and low, obviously.
[01:38:21.900 --> 01:38:25.900]  Don't fondle your finished product.
[01:38:25.900 --> 01:38:28.660]  Don't finger it, keep your hands off of it,
[01:38:28.660 --> 01:38:29.980]  treat it gentle.
[01:38:29.980 --> 01:38:34.180]  You can do a lot of damage between that chop and the dry.
[01:38:34.180 --> 01:38:37.780]  You can take something from primo to mids,
[01:38:37.780 --> 01:38:40.940]  like really from rough handling, rough cure,
[01:38:40.940 --> 01:38:43.260]  not trimming properly.
[01:38:43.260 --> 01:38:45.860]  And then if you get mold, you can go to zero.
[01:38:45.860 --> 01:38:47.180]  So it can go to zero.
[01:38:47.180 --> 01:38:50.500]  Really nice to zero really quick, so it's important.
[01:38:51.740 --> 01:38:53.340]  I think if you're in a commercial facility,
[01:38:53.340 --> 01:38:55.980]  you need someone just like you have a head grower,
[01:38:55.980 --> 01:38:57.380]  an assistant head grower,
[01:38:57.380 --> 01:39:00.900]  you kind of need a head dry cure person.
[01:39:00.900 --> 01:39:03.020]  Sometimes I've seen there's just too many
[01:39:03.020 --> 01:39:04.420]  thought processes going on.
[01:39:04.420 --> 01:39:07.180]  So one person comes in on Tuesday and they're like,
[01:39:07.180 --> 01:39:09.460]  oh, this is too, the humidity's too high,
[01:39:09.460 --> 01:39:10.780]  and so they change some things.
[01:39:10.780 --> 01:39:12.940]  And then the other person comes in on a Thursday,
[01:39:12.940 --> 01:39:14.180]  changes things up,
[01:39:14.220 --> 01:39:16.100]  and that's one of the obviously easiest ways
[01:39:16.100 --> 01:39:19.860]  to take your high quality cannabis to a booth product.
[01:39:19.860 --> 01:39:21.740]  And then again, it's just a race to the bottom
[01:39:21.740 --> 01:39:23.940]  when you're trying to sell that stuff.
[01:39:23.940 --> 01:39:28.300]  Yeah, and then that's just a spiraling downhill project
[01:39:28.300 --> 01:39:29.500]  right there.
[01:39:29.500 --> 01:39:33.900]  Because the beginner cannabis consumer,
[01:39:33.900 --> 01:39:37.300]  that's pretty much how they judge things
[01:39:37.300 --> 01:39:39.220]  is by look and smell.
[01:39:39.220 --> 01:39:41.620]  And so I think that's a really good thing
[01:39:41.660 --> 01:39:44.260]  to judge things is by look and smell.
[01:39:44.260 --> 01:39:47.300]  So if it looks pretty, but it just doesn't have that smell,
[01:39:47.300 --> 01:39:49.460]  again, it's gonna be really hard to sell that.
[01:39:49.460 --> 01:39:52.820]  The average person usually buys things off of
[01:39:52.820 --> 01:39:57.700]  kind of the way that the nose knows all the garbage.
[01:39:57.700 --> 01:39:59.260]  Oh yeah, definitely.
[01:40:00.780 --> 01:40:02.980]  Which was why it was a big disappointment
[01:40:02.980 --> 01:40:05.500]  when they took that option away in Washington.
[01:40:05.500 --> 01:40:07.900]  Medical system, you used to pop the jar,
[01:40:07.900 --> 01:40:11.060]  smell it, recreational system, it's all hermetically sealed,
[01:40:11.500 --> 01:40:12.500]  you'll never get a smell it.
[01:40:12.500 --> 01:40:16.540]  Oregon, they just went that way as well to prepackage.
[01:40:16.540 --> 01:40:19.420]  So yeah, getting to smell before you buy
[01:40:19.420 --> 01:40:24.420]  is no longer an option, which that's how the real buyers buy.
[01:40:26.500 --> 01:40:29.860]  But real quick, I've been popping up Instagrams
[01:40:29.860 --> 01:40:32.340]  and websites for you guys and Marco.
[01:40:32.340 --> 01:40:34.700]  So that's a way to get ahold of these gentlemen,
[01:40:34.700 --> 01:40:36.060]  if you wanna reach out.
[01:40:36.060 --> 01:40:37.940]  This person was just asking,
[01:40:37.940 --> 01:40:40.340]  if you're networking with some farmers in your area,
[01:40:40.340 --> 01:40:43.580]  because again, you have a lot of imports and knowledge
[01:40:43.580 --> 01:40:48.580]  that applies universally to growing, it's not just cannabis.
[01:40:48.580 --> 01:40:49.940]  Yeah, thank you, thank you, Chad.
[01:40:49.940 --> 01:40:52.020]  Yes, sir, I am, man.
[01:40:52.020 --> 01:40:54.740]  Well, I'm here where my feet are on the ground,
[01:40:54.740 --> 01:40:57.260]  I'm in Petersburg, so I'm here, I got my property,
[01:40:57.260 --> 01:40:59.100]  so we're working.
[01:40:59.100 --> 01:41:02.340]  Definitely reach out to me on Instagram.
[01:41:02.340 --> 01:41:05.100]  I'm very focused on, I'm telling you, I mean this,
[01:41:05.100 --> 01:41:07.900]  when the big boys come, we wanna have this shit set up
[01:41:07.900 --> 01:41:09.300]  and established in Virginia,
[01:41:09.300 --> 01:41:12.140]  it's gotta be quality, it's gotta be top notch.
[01:41:12.140 --> 01:41:14.660]  So yeah, I'm definitely looking to link up with folks, man.
[01:41:14.660 --> 01:41:17.780]  We had a little natural farming get together
[01:41:19.060 --> 01:41:21.820]  probably about a month ago now, a small turnout.
[01:41:22.740 --> 01:41:26.540]  And yeah, just slowly just networking and building it up,
[01:41:26.540 --> 01:41:29.540]  man, because what's gonna happen is we gotta get tight
[01:41:29.540 --> 01:41:30.380]  before they come.
[01:41:30.380 --> 01:41:32.980]  When they come in, they're gonna try to divide and conquer,
[01:41:32.980 --> 01:41:35.740]  and then it's just gonna be a free for all.
[01:41:35.740 --> 01:41:37.980]  So yeah, hit me up on Instagram, man,
[01:41:38.100 --> 01:41:40.940]  and we'll kinda keep growing together
[01:41:40.940 --> 01:41:42.300]  as a community down here.
[01:41:44.140 --> 01:41:46.340]  That's the only way you're gonna win, man.
[01:41:46.340 --> 01:41:48.500]  I think I mentioned on the show last week
[01:41:48.500 --> 01:41:50.540]  about some meetings that I've been in,
[01:41:50.540 --> 01:41:54.100]  and the one gentleman, very well off,
[01:41:54.100 --> 01:41:57.340]  obviously a solid business individual,
[01:41:57.340 --> 01:41:59.260]  was kinda making fun of our whole industry
[01:41:59.260 --> 01:42:00.620]  because none of us get along,
[01:42:00.620 --> 01:42:02.380]  so why the hell would they wanna invest in us
[01:42:02.380 --> 01:42:05.700]  if we don't even look out for each other?
[01:42:05.700 --> 01:42:07.660]  So I think that's something that hopefully Marco
[01:42:08.340 --> 01:42:09.780]  can put a flag down,
[01:42:09.780 --> 01:42:12.620]  and hopefully more people start to gravitate towards,
[01:42:12.620 --> 01:42:15.220]  because here in Colorado, when first things started pop off,
[01:42:15.220 --> 01:42:19.060]  everybody was trying to bully each other around
[01:42:19.060 --> 01:42:21.580]  or steal genetics or call certain genetics
[01:42:21.580 --> 01:42:22.420]  these certain things.
[01:42:22.420 --> 01:42:26.260]  So integrity, morals, that kinda stuff goes a long way
[01:42:27.100 --> 01:42:29.460]  for our side of things.
[01:42:29.460 --> 01:42:30.460]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:42:30.460 --> 01:42:32.420]  And like you said, networking, man,
[01:42:32.420 --> 01:42:34.220]  and people have different strains.
[01:42:34.220 --> 01:42:36.340]  Like we're Virginians coming out of the woodwork.
[01:42:36.380 --> 01:42:39.380]  There could be some really nice strains out there, man,
[01:42:39.380 --> 01:42:40.940]  that we could get out to the people.
[01:42:40.940 --> 01:42:43.420]  And that's only gonna happen as we grow
[01:42:43.420 --> 01:42:45.620]  and people start feeling more comfortable
[01:42:45.620 --> 01:42:47.420]  and coming on out the woodwork.
[01:42:48.540 --> 01:42:51.820]  So yeah, I think that's definitely.
[01:42:51.820 --> 01:42:53.620]  Reach out to me, man, if you're interested
[01:42:53.620 --> 01:42:56.980]  in natural farming and teaming up on anything.
[01:42:56.980 --> 01:42:57.820]  I'm here for you.
[01:42:59.900 --> 01:43:04.300]  And here's kind of a fun, nonsensical question
[01:43:04.340 --> 01:43:07.540]  from one of our regular viewers.
[01:43:07.540 --> 01:43:09.460]  And actually he's been a guest on one of my shows,
[01:43:09.460 --> 01:43:11.380]  Mr. Chris Guerrero.
[01:43:11.380 --> 01:43:13.300]  I'll just leave it for you guys there.
[01:43:14.580 --> 01:43:15.820]  Get your little laugh on.
[01:43:17.180 --> 01:43:18.020]  Mm-hmm.
[01:43:18.020 --> 01:43:18.860]  Mm-hmm.
[01:43:18.860 --> 01:43:19.700]  Mm-hmm.
[01:43:19.700 --> 01:43:20.540]  Mm-hmm.
[01:43:20.540 --> 01:43:21.380]  Mm-hmm.
[01:43:21.380 --> 01:43:22.700]  It's a good question.
[01:43:22.700 --> 01:43:25.660]  And this, the scary follow-up though,
[01:43:25.660 --> 01:43:27.420]  the scary follow-up is Cheddar Bob
[01:43:27.420 --> 01:43:28.820]  knows where you can get gerbils.
[01:43:28.820 --> 01:43:29.660]  Right.
[01:43:31.420 --> 01:43:32.980]  Fucking Cheddar Bob, dude.
[01:43:32.980 --> 01:43:34.140]  I figured that.
[01:43:34.980 --> 01:43:35.980]  I would think that the cat would get high
[01:43:35.980 --> 01:43:38.420]  the same way, like, supposedly,
[01:43:38.420 --> 01:43:40.100]  like if a shaman eats something,
[01:43:40.100 --> 01:43:41.740]  then people would drink the piss
[01:43:41.740 --> 01:43:44.460]  and all these kind of crazy things.
[01:43:44.460 --> 01:43:48.860]  But yeah, I think that medicine value would still be there.
[01:43:48.860 --> 01:43:51.180]  Yeah, that's a funny question.
[01:43:51.180 --> 01:43:53.500]  But I got a ticket somewhere else.
[01:43:53.500 --> 01:43:56.540]  So just think in the seventies, bald eagles.
[01:43:57.500 --> 01:44:00.300]  We sprayed DDT all over the fucking world.
[01:44:00.300 --> 01:44:02.300]  Everything ate DDT.
[01:44:02.300 --> 01:44:05.140]  The bald eagles were at the top of the food chain.
[01:44:05.140 --> 01:44:10.140]  Their eggs shells got thin because of the DDT.
[01:44:10.140 --> 01:44:11.980]  Eagle populations went down.
[01:44:11.980 --> 01:44:13.900]  Now they run an endangered species list.
[01:44:13.900 --> 01:44:17.060]  We stopped using DDT, eagles are back.
[01:44:17.060 --> 01:44:19.780]  So everything has a reaction.
[01:44:20.700 --> 01:44:24.100]  Yeah, what was, I don't know if it was DDT or not,
[01:44:24.100 --> 01:44:29.100]  but what was that stuff in the, like, fifties and sixties?
[01:44:29.420 --> 01:44:30.460]  They said it was great.
[01:44:30.460 --> 01:44:32.200]  It was like a pesticide for crops,
[01:44:33.100 --> 01:44:34.680]  but they would be like blasting fools in the face
[01:44:34.680 --> 01:44:37.880]  at the picnic table, proving that, look, this is safe.
[01:44:37.880 --> 01:44:39.480]  Yeah, well, see that, man,
[01:44:39.480 --> 01:44:41.600]  that takes us to a whole different conversation
[01:44:41.600 --> 01:44:45.320]  because it's like, they really don't give a damn about us.
[01:44:45.320 --> 01:44:49.000]  Like if you think, like, and I say they is like big ag,
[01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:50.840]  big money, the big higher ups.
[01:44:50.840 --> 01:44:53.680]  They don't care about me and you and our wellbeing.
[01:44:53.680 --> 01:44:56.160]  And just think way back then, like you said, Chad,
[01:44:56.160 --> 01:44:59.440]  they were like, shower you with DDT.
[01:44:59.760 --> 01:45:02.320]  Hey, this is safe because it didn't kill you today.
[01:45:02.320 --> 01:45:04.560]  See, it can kill you later.
[01:45:04.560 --> 01:45:06.640]  But yeah, man, we've come a long way,
[01:45:06.640 --> 01:45:10.360]  but we got a long way to go still with this chemical shit.
[01:45:10.360 --> 01:45:13.000]  Jeff Lohenfels, if you Google some of his stuff,
[01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:15.840]  he's done some awesome presentations where he has photos
[01:45:15.840 --> 01:45:20.120]  of that, of like cute women in the fifties and sixties
[01:45:20.120 --> 01:45:23.520]  out there just spraying all that stuff without anything.
[01:45:23.520 --> 01:45:26.560]  And his little caveat at the end is 100%
[01:45:26.560 --> 01:45:28.360]  that woman died of cancer.
[01:45:28.520 --> 01:45:29.480]  That's what he said.
[01:45:29.480 --> 01:45:33.440]  So yeah, I think hopefully we're starting
[01:45:33.440 --> 01:45:36.800]  to make a small turn and as our community builds,
[01:45:36.800 --> 01:45:39.360]  I hope more and more people see that there are so many
[01:45:39.360 --> 01:45:43.720]  more alternatives to growing crops than what we were taught.
[01:45:43.720 --> 01:45:45.120]  Yeah, definitely.
[01:45:46.200 --> 01:45:48.760]  And there's a lot more people figuring out how to do it
[01:45:48.760 --> 01:45:52.120]  at scale and I'm not talking warehouse, I'm talking acres.
[01:45:53.040 --> 01:45:53.960]  So that's awesome.
[01:45:53.960 --> 01:45:56.560]  I was, I forget, I think it was like Illinois or Iowa,
[01:45:56.600 --> 01:45:58.960]  but I was watching a keynote the other day of a guy who,
[01:45:58.960 --> 01:46:03.280]  yeah, this was, the farm's been in his family
[01:46:03.280 --> 01:46:05.880]  for generations, but this, it was a slow succession,
[01:46:05.880 --> 01:46:08.200]  but this 2020 was the first year he didn't use
[01:46:08.200 --> 01:46:10.600]  like any nitrogen on the entire farm.
[01:46:10.600 --> 01:46:13.160]  And he didn't have to use like any pesticides at all,
[01:46:13.160 --> 01:46:16.520]  which for traditional farming is a pretty big thing.
[01:46:16.520 --> 01:46:19.560]  Took him years or so to get there, all this property,
[01:46:19.560 --> 01:46:22.640]  but yeah, he's there now.
[01:46:22.640 --> 01:46:25.240]  The crazy thing is it's kind of scary
[01:46:25.240 --> 01:46:27.960]  because like he did all that work to figure that out,
[01:46:27.960 --> 01:46:31.320]  right, and then just say, big ag does finally say,
[01:46:31.320 --> 01:46:33.360]  oh yeah, we better get into natural farming.
[01:46:33.360 --> 01:46:37.880]  They'll find a way again to make it worse,
[01:46:37.880 --> 01:46:40.520]  because they're gonna always go back to the dollar.
[01:46:40.520 --> 01:46:43.880]  So it's like, I don't know, I don't fear big ag
[01:46:43.880 --> 01:46:46.440]  because they're just, they're dumb.
[01:46:46.440 --> 01:46:47.360]  They don't get it.
[01:46:49.640 --> 01:46:52.120]  Anyway, enough about my rambling.
[01:46:59.410 --> 01:47:00.250]  Mute.
[01:47:04.140 --> 01:47:04.980]  I can't hear you.
[01:47:04.980 --> 01:47:06.540]  Sorry, I'm like, yeah, no, sorry.
[01:47:06.540 --> 01:47:07.980]  I'm on like multiple screens.
[01:47:07.980 --> 01:47:08.820]  I'm looking at that.
[01:47:08.820 --> 01:47:09.940]  I did find the guy's name.
[01:47:09.940 --> 01:47:11.420]  His name is Rick Clark.
[01:47:11.420 --> 01:47:14.940]  So that was the person who gave the keynote,
[01:47:14.940 --> 01:47:17.980]  Central Wisconsin Farm Profitability.
[01:47:17.980 --> 01:47:19.420]  He was out there.
[01:47:19.420 --> 01:47:21.740]  Shout out to the American one for sending me that info,
[01:47:21.740 --> 01:47:26.740]  because I love listening to farmers, agriculture people.
[01:47:26.780 --> 01:47:30.220]  Not, you know, cannabis is great,
[01:47:30.260 --> 01:47:32.060]  but I also love hearing the farmers.
[01:47:33.180 --> 01:47:34.220]  I agree.
[01:47:34.220 --> 01:47:36.860]  Now, did he get into, was it, okay,
[01:47:36.860 --> 01:47:40.860]  if before he made the change, was X profitable?
[01:47:40.860 --> 01:47:42.580]  Was this as profitable?
[01:47:42.580 --> 01:47:45.500]  Maybe not as profitable, but it's still,
[01:47:45.500 --> 01:47:47.140]  like, did he break that down at all?
[01:47:47.140 --> 01:47:49.500]  He did break that down, because, you know,
[01:47:49.500 --> 01:47:51.340]  he's up front, you're gonna concede,
[01:47:51.340 --> 01:47:55.340]  you're gonna lose yield.
[01:47:55.340 --> 01:47:58.740]  But then again, his business was biomass as well.
[01:47:58.740 --> 01:48:01.580]  So it's not necessarily like the trichomes and cannabis.
[01:48:01.580 --> 01:48:04.260]  It was more about biomass.
[01:48:04.260 --> 01:48:08.420]  He had to plant more fields to kind of get
[01:48:08.420 --> 01:48:12.060]  the same amount of yield in the beginning,
[01:48:12.060 --> 01:48:16.140]  but it was a continual succession over these 20 years
[01:48:16.140 --> 01:48:19.380]  of changing the practices in each sector.
[01:48:19.380 --> 01:48:20.220]  Because he's like, you know,
[01:48:20.220 --> 01:48:22.340]  you can't just drop of a hat, go at it.
[01:48:23.500 --> 01:48:25.820]  That's just not practical for any farmer.
[01:48:25.820 --> 01:48:29.340]  But in the end, yeah, the return on investment
[01:48:29.340 --> 01:48:31.580]  was something that he did speak about in that.
[01:48:31.580 --> 01:48:36.580]  And again, when you're applying like 2000 pounds
[01:48:36.580 --> 01:48:39.100]  of nitrogen per acre, and then all of a sudden
[01:48:39.100 --> 01:48:40.700]  you're not doing that anymore.
[01:48:41.900 --> 01:48:46.380]  That's direct dollars right there, right in your pocket.
[01:48:46.380 --> 01:48:47.500]  Yeah, that's pretty cool, man.
[01:48:47.500 --> 01:48:51.380]  I think, I bet you, along with that 20 years of growth,
[01:48:51.380 --> 01:48:55.220]  he's dialed in and tuned his process
[01:48:55.620 --> 01:48:59.260]  to the point where maybe he was half the yield at first.
[01:48:59.260 --> 01:49:01.620]  He's probably pushing that up and eventually
[01:49:01.620 --> 01:49:04.740]  he'll make it to equal and hopefully he'll make even more.
[01:49:05.900 --> 01:49:07.540]  Ultimate goal, I'm sure.
[01:49:07.540 --> 01:49:09.860]  It was really cool how he had it broken down
[01:49:09.860 --> 01:49:12.860]  because as you guys know, with like cover crops
[01:49:12.860 --> 01:49:14.540]  and certain other plants, legumes,
[01:49:14.540 --> 01:49:17.700]  there's ways to fixate the nitrogen into your soil.
[01:49:17.700 --> 01:49:19.540]  And just the way that he had the planting
[01:49:19.540 --> 01:49:21.540]  and the way that he had the grasses growing,
[01:49:21.540 --> 01:49:25.300]  he knew at a certain height that it was okay
[01:49:25.300 --> 01:49:26.980]  to go and input this because then
[01:49:26.980 --> 01:49:28.340]  there wouldn't be any competition.
[01:49:28.340 --> 01:49:32.340]  So yeah, it was a long journey for this guy
[01:49:32.340 --> 01:49:35.780]  and it's cool to see this at scale.
[01:49:35.780 --> 01:49:38.020]  Kind of like we were talking about earlier,
[01:49:38.020 --> 01:49:40.460]  there's people who have to do a lot of the long,
[01:49:40.460 --> 01:49:42.740]  hard work to this.
[01:49:42.740 --> 01:49:46.700]  And then we see it in a book or in the video,
[01:49:46.700 --> 01:49:48.500]  oh, well that's just what you do.
[01:49:48.500 --> 01:49:49.340]  Right.
[01:49:49.340 --> 01:49:51.420]  And then he's put in that work.
[01:49:52.260 --> 01:49:54.500]  So it's cool and hopefully that gets replicated
[01:49:55.540 --> 01:49:56.860]  on the bigger scale.
[01:49:56.860 --> 01:49:57.700]  Exactly.
[01:49:57.700 --> 01:49:59.460]  The process, that's kind of where you're,
[01:49:59.460 --> 01:50:01.700]  when something costs something,
[01:50:01.700 --> 01:50:04.500]  it's kind of that 20 years of time I put into it
[01:50:04.500 --> 01:50:06.500]  to figure it out, you know what I mean?
[01:50:06.500 --> 01:50:08.340]  That that's gonna save you.
[01:50:08.340 --> 01:50:11.740]  Most people, I'm sure you feel the same way, man.
[01:50:11.740 --> 01:50:15.060]  To save time by talking to someone with a lot of experience
[01:50:15.060 --> 01:50:17.220]  or doing it a way that they can do it,
[01:50:18.060 --> 01:50:21.020]  I'll pay for that any day to save that time,
[01:50:21.020 --> 01:50:21.860]  you know what I mean?
[01:50:21.860 --> 01:50:23.660]  So pretty cool.
[01:50:24.780 --> 01:50:25.660]  Definitely.
[01:50:25.660 --> 01:50:29.100]  And Brian, oh, he was having some technical issues there,
[01:50:29.100 --> 01:50:31.700]  but looks like he's popping back in here.
[01:50:31.700 --> 01:50:32.540]  Okay.
[01:50:32.540 --> 01:50:34.420]  Hopefully the microphone and everything
[01:50:34.420 --> 01:50:37.340]  is working out for you there now.
[01:50:37.340 --> 01:50:38.420]  No, I'll be honest.
[01:50:38.420 --> 01:50:42.820]  I got COVID and I am puking behind the scenes.
[01:50:42.820 --> 01:50:43.660]  So.
[01:50:44.580 --> 01:50:46.180]  He's a soreness, man.
[01:50:46.180 --> 01:50:47.420]  I'm just gonna say this.
[01:50:47.420 --> 01:50:49.340]  This is the Brett Favre moment
[01:50:49.340 --> 01:50:51.980]  of Future Cannabis Project, people.
[01:50:51.980 --> 01:50:54.860]  This man is starting the game
[01:50:54.860 --> 01:50:56.940]  and he's got a puke bucket next to him.
[01:50:56.940 --> 01:50:58.340]  He's hardcore, man.
[01:50:58.340 --> 01:50:59.180]  He's not playing.
[01:50:59.180 --> 01:51:00.060]  I like it.
[01:51:00.060 --> 01:51:03.860]  If you've ever wondered how dedicated these people are
[01:51:03.860 --> 01:51:06.660]  to bringing you education, puke bucket.
[01:51:07.620 --> 01:51:08.460]  Yeah.
[01:51:08.460 --> 01:51:10.540]  Yeah, COVID is no joke.
[01:51:10.540 --> 01:51:13.540]  So however you feel about it,
[01:51:13.540 --> 01:51:15.780]  just letting you know that that shit is real
[01:51:16.380 --> 01:51:18.500]  and health is wealth.
[01:51:18.500 --> 01:51:19.460]  Yep.
[01:51:19.460 --> 01:51:21.260]  And let's see here.
[01:51:21.260 --> 01:51:22.340]  Question for you, Brian.
[01:51:22.340 --> 01:51:24.180]  Do you clean or process your bunny poo
[01:51:24.180 --> 01:51:26.180]  before the worms get it?
[01:51:26.180 --> 01:51:27.260]  Nope, not at all.
[01:51:27.260 --> 01:51:29.740]  As soon as it comes out, I can put it down.
[01:51:29.740 --> 01:51:33.340]  I also use the bunny poo to feed my isopods.
[01:51:33.340 --> 01:51:36.020]  So there's a variety of ways that you can use that.
[01:51:36.020 --> 01:51:40.780]  And I'm specializing in something called the Cubarus isopod,
[01:51:40.780 --> 01:51:44.100]  which was just discovered in Thailand in 2017.
[01:51:44.100 --> 01:51:47.820]  And for a long time, people were having trouble breeding
[01:51:47.820 --> 01:51:49.380]  what's known as the rubber ducky isopod.
[01:51:49.380 --> 01:51:51.420]  That's why I named my company after that.
[01:51:51.420 --> 01:51:55.460]  It's a extremely rare isopod, extremely hard to breed.
[01:51:55.460 --> 01:51:57.940]  And I've noticed that the bunny poop
[01:51:57.940 --> 01:52:02.500]  and obviously using a living soil compost, vermicompost,
[01:52:02.500 --> 01:52:04.860]  I'm having great success with that.
[01:52:04.860 --> 01:52:08.140]  So not only can you use these skillsets to farm plants,
[01:52:08.140 --> 01:52:11.540]  but I'm finding other ways to use this to create a company
[01:52:11.540 --> 01:52:13.980]  for my wife and I create a company for ourselves.
[01:52:16.100 --> 01:52:18.380]  So the short answer is no, not at all.
[01:52:18.380 --> 01:52:21.340]  Any cold compost you can use right away.
[01:52:21.340 --> 01:52:24.100]  I would use again the worms if I was using like sheep manure
[01:52:24.100 --> 01:52:25.300]  or something like that.
[01:52:26.900 --> 01:52:28.540]  But I personally have never used that.
[01:52:28.540 --> 01:52:30.780]  I just like, I like to use the cold manures
[01:52:30.780 --> 01:52:35.780]  because there's such a less risk of any issues
[01:52:35.900 --> 01:52:37.500]  that you've brought on yourself.
[01:52:40.540 --> 01:52:43.180]  Well, I can tell I'm at the CO2 portion
[01:52:43.180 --> 01:52:45.460]  of the chat section right now.
[01:52:45.460 --> 01:52:46.900]  I'm seeing all the CO2 comments.
[01:52:46.900 --> 01:52:49.540]  So I'm still scrolling down looking for your questions, guys.
[01:52:49.540 --> 01:52:50.380]  And we're trying to get it,
[01:52:50.380 --> 01:52:52.180]  trying to get them all up here for you.
[01:52:52.180 --> 01:52:55.660]  So again, I do appreciate the participation here
[01:52:55.660 --> 01:52:57.220]  and this guy, he loves me.
[01:52:57.220 --> 01:52:59.540]  He loves my white papers.
[01:52:59.540 --> 01:53:00.780]  I just had to put that up.
[01:53:00.780 --> 01:53:01.620]  Hi, Robert.
[01:53:02.660 --> 01:53:03.820]  He always gives me crap,
[01:53:03.820 --> 01:53:04.980]  but I will say there's a difference
[01:53:04.980 --> 01:53:06.820]  between a white paper and a research paper.
[01:53:06.860 --> 01:53:09.820]  White papers are paid for by companies.
[01:53:09.820 --> 01:53:13.620]  So research is typically peer reviewed.
[01:53:13.620 --> 01:53:14.460]  Yeah.
[01:53:14.460 --> 01:53:15.620]  That's the distinction.
[01:53:15.620 --> 01:53:16.460]  Just so you guys know,
[01:53:16.460 --> 01:53:18.460]  you can get a white paper written on Fiverr.
[01:53:18.460 --> 01:53:22.340]  So it's not that academic, right?
[01:53:22.340 --> 01:53:25.540]  If I can pay 50 bucks and get one written for myself.
[01:53:25.540 --> 01:53:26.900]  Right, right.
[01:53:26.900 --> 01:53:27.860]  Let's see here.
[01:53:27.860 --> 01:53:29.620]  Now we're to the exhale bags.
[01:53:29.620 --> 01:53:30.460]  Okay.
[01:53:30.460 --> 01:53:31.300]  Yep.
[01:53:31.300 --> 01:53:33.900]  Kind of nope, nope on the exhale bags.
[01:53:33.900 --> 01:53:34.740]  Yeah.
[01:53:34.740 --> 01:53:35.580]  You know, I've wondered,
[01:53:35.580 --> 01:53:38.620]  it's like just sitting in your grow room,
[01:53:38.620 --> 01:53:41.220]  talking if this was a sealed or, you know,
[01:53:41.220 --> 01:53:43.580]  just a room where my plants were.
[01:53:43.580 --> 01:53:46.100]  The CO2 levels are probably almost twice
[01:53:46.100 --> 01:53:47.740]  as what they were when I came in here,
[01:53:47.740 --> 01:53:49.340]  just because I'm talking so much
[01:53:49.340 --> 01:53:51.420]  and expelling it and the door's closed.
[01:53:51.420 --> 01:53:56.220]  So that's also a way to kind of boost it if you want to.
[01:53:56.220 --> 01:53:58.380]  Hey, one more note on the CO2.
[01:53:58.380 --> 01:54:01.680]  Buddy and my shout out, Big Worm, local Virginia grower.
[01:54:02.700 --> 01:54:05.300]  He does some, he run his meter, CO2 meter,
[01:54:06.020 --> 01:54:08.460]  and we saw that just the act of building a living soil,
[01:54:08.460 --> 01:54:13.460]  just the respiring and living increased the CO2 numbers.
[01:54:13.620 --> 01:54:15.220]  Few hundred, easy.
[01:54:15.220 --> 01:54:17.540]  And this was early, right after it was built,
[01:54:17.540 --> 01:54:19.660]  but interesting.
[01:54:19.660 --> 01:54:22.600]  I feel like you can see that in high quality soils sometimes
[01:54:22.600 --> 01:54:24.740]  where the microbes are living and breathing,
[01:54:24.740 --> 01:54:27.860]  the bag will swell up and then there's humidity.
[01:54:27.860 --> 01:54:31.760]  So take that for what it's worth as well.
[01:54:31.760 --> 01:54:34.460]  Yeah, your whole, like when you do a four by four,
[01:54:34.460 --> 01:54:36.500]  literally that first week or two,
[01:54:36.500 --> 01:54:38.500]  like that your walls are just wet.
[01:54:38.500 --> 01:54:40.420]  Like it's just so much moisture,
[01:54:40.420 --> 01:54:42.140]  so much life breathing and stuff.
[01:54:42.140 --> 01:54:43.140]  It's pretty awesome.
[01:54:43.140 --> 01:54:44.980]  My buddy, when he first experienced it,
[01:54:44.980 --> 01:54:46.500]  he opened up my tent and he's like,
[01:54:46.500 --> 01:54:48.300]  wow, it smells so fresh.
[01:54:48.300 --> 01:54:51.140]  I'm like, well, yeah, a lot of life in there, you know?
[01:54:52.500 --> 01:54:54.420]  Yeah, well, let's see here.
[01:54:54.420 --> 01:54:59.420]  Here's, this might be a alternative hack,
[01:54:59.780 --> 01:55:04.300]  but what do you guys think about wood stove pellets
[01:55:05.140 --> 01:55:08.500]  or alfalfa horse feed pellets for making compost?
[01:55:08.500 --> 01:55:11.260]  Is it almost just like concentrated nutrition
[01:55:11.260 --> 01:55:15.000]  in those pellets or is it more of a texture type thing?
[01:55:16.020 --> 01:55:17.560]  I'll say first.
[01:55:17.560 --> 01:55:20.820]  So I'll be cautious of the wood stove pellets
[01:55:20.820 --> 01:55:24.380]  because I'm not sure the process of making them, you know?
[01:55:24.380 --> 01:55:25.940]  And so I'll leave it at that.
[01:55:25.940 --> 01:55:29.340]  Alfalfa pellets, however, are just alfalfa hay
[01:55:29.340 --> 01:55:31.660]  and it's just mashed through an extruder
[01:55:31.660 --> 01:55:33.540]  and they push out little pellets.
[01:55:33.540 --> 01:55:35.980]  So if you were to soak one and break it up,
[01:55:35.980 --> 01:55:38.860]  it's just little pieces of alfalfa.
[01:55:38.860 --> 01:55:40.340]  I actually like the pellets, man.
[01:55:40.340 --> 01:55:45.340]  Sometimes the straw, it's a bit long in fiber
[01:55:47.280 --> 01:55:52.280]  for doing like kind of a top mulch layer.
[01:55:52.460 --> 01:55:54.500]  So the pellets, you can get a lot more kind of bang
[01:55:54.500 --> 01:55:57.340]  for your buck in a small space, I feel like with the pellets.
[01:55:57.340 --> 01:55:59.440]  But I like the pellets, they're all good.
[01:56:00.860 --> 01:56:02.340]  Again, shout out to Leighton on that,
[01:56:02.340 --> 01:56:04.620]  but it's really easy to be a moron
[01:56:04.620 --> 01:56:06.020]  with the alfalfa pellets
[01:56:06.020 --> 01:56:07.980]  and you can burn the shit out of your living soil
[01:56:07.980 --> 01:56:09.580]  if you go crazy with alfalfa.
[01:56:09.580 --> 01:56:13.660]  So just little goes a long way with the pellets.
[01:56:13.660 --> 01:56:15.580]  You might not think that you're putting so much on there,
[01:56:15.580 --> 01:56:17.740]  but like Marco had mentioned, once water hits that,
[01:56:17.740 --> 01:56:22.740]  they expand pretty large for how small it is.
[01:56:23.340 --> 01:56:26.700]  And then if you have hundreds of those on a small bed,
[01:56:26.700 --> 01:56:29.140]  obviously you're overfeeding.
[01:56:29.140 --> 01:56:32.900]  Yeah, go by, focus kind of on your weight with the pellets.
[01:56:34.460 --> 01:56:36.860]  You won't burn much with the straw, but yes,
[01:56:36.860 --> 01:56:39.620]  pellets definitely, 100%, they're really concentrated.
[01:56:39.620 --> 01:56:41.860]  So yeah, makes sense.
[01:56:44.280 --> 01:56:46.360]  All right, I'm just scrolling through here.
[01:56:46.360 --> 01:56:48.480]  A lot of agreeing, let's see.
[01:56:50.960 --> 01:56:53.160]  Oh, I didn't know Kentucky was voting on the fourth
[01:56:53.160 --> 01:56:54.320]  to go legal.
[01:56:54.320 --> 01:56:56.240]  All right, go vote.
[01:56:56.240 --> 01:56:57.080]  That would be awesome.
[01:56:57.080 --> 01:56:59.440]  And somebody had mentioned in chat earlier
[01:56:59.480 --> 01:57:01.360]  that Oregon, and I'll have to again,
[01:57:01.360 --> 01:57:03.560]  verify this and look it up,
[01:57:03.560 --> 01:57:08.560]  but sounded like Oregon today banned CRC products,
[01:57:09.400 --> 01:57:11.120]  which would be awesome.
[01:57:11.120 --> 01:57:12.840]  And Oregon wouldn't surprise me either.
[01:57:12.840 --> 01:57:16.360]  They're usually pretty forward on cutting the,
[01:57:17.960 --> 01:57:19.640]  I almost swore there, the BS.
[01:57:22.760 --> 01:57:24.200]  You're allowed to swear, Chad.
[01:57:24.200 --> 01:57:25.600]  Okay, all right.
[01:57:26.520 --> 01:57:27.760]  Oh, shit.
[01:57:28.240 --> 01:57:30.320]  I don't know how everybody feels about it though.
[01:57:30.320 --> 01:57:31.680]  Again, it is another product.
[01:57:31.680 --> 01:57:34.400]  It is using a waste stream.
[01:57:34.400 --> 01:57:37.480]  I guess there's always gonna be purists though.
[01:57:37.480 --> 01:57:38.320]  Well, let's just-
[01:57:38.320 --> 01:57:40.080]  Probably fall in the purist category.
[01:57:40.880 --> 01:57:42.920]  Let's all just let the newer viewers know
[01:57:42.920 --> 01:57:44.800]  that if you're using CRC,
[01:57:44.800 --> 01:57:47.560]  that product wasn't the best, right?
[01:57:47.560 --> 01:57:51.760]  CRC is used when huge fuck ups have occurred.
[01:57:51.760 --> 01:57:52.600]  Yeah.
[01:57:52.600 --> 01:57:54.720]  Usually when they're spraying high pesticides
[01:57:54.720 --> 01:57:57.160]  and fungicides, then it becomes CRC.
[01:57:58.600 --> 01:58:00.480]  It's yeah, what you do with the stuff
[01:58:00.480 --> 01:58:02.600]  that you know won't pass testing.
[01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:06.360]  Yeah, give it to a CRC expert.
[01:58:06.360 --> 01:58:08.000]  And then bring a little money for yourself.
[01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:08.840]  Yeah, right.
[01:58:08.840 --> 01:58:10.320]  Should be burned.
[01:58:10.320 --> 01:58:12.280]  Yeah, overgrow, right?
[01:58:12.280 --> 01:58:13.120]  Overgrow.
[01:58:13.120 --> 01:58:14.080]  Get it out of here.
[01:58:16.000 --> 01:58:17.400]  Let's see here.
[01:58:19.400 --> 01:58:21.880]  Oh, that's just kind of a generic product question.
[01:58:21.880 --> 01:58:25.240]  I'm trying to avoid like specific brand name questions
[01:58:25.240 --> 01:58:26.080]  for you guys,
[01:58:26.880 --> 01:58:29.400]  you probably haven't tried everything under the sun,
[01:58:29.400 --> 01:58:32.520]  especially when it comes from bottles.
[01:58:32.520 --> 01:58:35.520]  One note on the alfalfa guys, look local too.
[01:58:35.520 --> 01:58:37.120]  Like there's a lot of like farmers
[01:58:37.120 --> 01:58:38.440]  that grow that stuff local.
[01:58:38.440 --> 01:58:42.000]  I was at a, my wife's friends had us over
[01:58:42.000 --> 01:58:44.120]  for a little Christmas get together thing.
[01:58:44.120 --> 01:58:46.520]  And I met a guy that they have 500 acres
[01:58:46.520 --> 01:58:50.280]  and they farm alfalfa and these specialty grains.
[01:58:50.280 --> 01:58:53.680]  So like, yes, we hit it off.
[01:58:53.680 --> 01:58:55.280]  Bob and I are friends.
[01:58:57.080 --> 01:58:58.640]  So it's pretty cool.
[01:59:00.880 --> 01:59:02.160]  Let's see here.
[01:59:04.760 --> 01:59:06.480]  Damn it, I just lost the question.
[01:59:07.760 --> 01:59:10.400]  How do you like your larger tent Chad?
[01:59:10.400 --> 01:59:12.160]  I'm liking the larger tent, man.
[01:59:12.160 --> 01:59:15.120]  I like the larger tent because I have more room
[01:59:15.120 --> 01:59:16.480]  to let the plants grow.
[01:59:16.480 --> 01:59:18.560]  But again, you can give me 10 feet
[01:59:18.560 --> 01:59:20.400]  and it's gonna be just as packed.
[01:59:20.400 --> 01:59:23.920]  I drew commercially, so I know you can pack them in there.
[01:59:23.920 --> 01:59:24.760]  Right.
[01:59:24.760 --> 01:59:26.240]  And then that's what I do.
[01:59:26.240 --> 01:59:28.400]  Again, I try to turn things over fairly fast
[01:59:28.400 --> 01:59:32.680]  so I don't take the time to build the monster bush
[01:59:32.680 --> 01:59:35.160]  and then just have a massive harvest.
[01:59:35.160 --> 01:59:38.360]  I like variety and frequency.
[01:59:38.360 --> 01:59:39.560]  Thank you.
[01:59:39.560 --> 01:59:42.720]  I'm the worst at like keeping something going forever
[01:59:42.720 --> 01:59:43.560]  and ever and ever.
[01:59:43.560 --> 01:59:45.720]  Like I'm like, even if it's wonderful,
[01:59:45.720 --> 01:59:47.240]  I might just get bored with it.
[01:59:47.240 --> 01:59:49.440]  You know, I kind of wanna move on.
[01:59:49.440 --> 01:59:50.320]  So that's.
[01:59:50.320 --> 01:59:52.960]  Yeah, I've got a lot of new genetics
[01:59:53.000 --> 01:59:54.720]  that I'm excited to get into.
[01:59:54.720 --> 01:59:56.800]  I'm gonna be popping some on the first here.
[01:59:56.800 --> 01:59:59.200]  B. Leaf, Kool-Aid man's gonna be one of them.
[01:59:59.200 --> 02:00:00.520]  Co-writer there.
[02:00:00.520 --> 02:00:01.560]  Oh dude, yeah.
[02:00:01.560 --> 02:00:04.760]  His Instagram, I'm like, how can I not at least put a few
[02:00:04.760 --> 02:00:06.480]  in the soil on this next run?
[02:00:06.480 --> 02:00:09.320]  Man, his plants are so strong too, man.
[02:00:09.320 --> 02:00:11.680]  I got some cuts from them and they're very strong.
[02:00:11.680 --> 02:00:13.760]  I love the structure, not in flower yet.
[02:00:13.760 --> 02:00:15.360]  Actually just flipped today.
[02:00:15.360 --> 02:00:17.640]  But yeah, looking forward to his stuff, man.
[02:00:17.640 --> 02:00:19.080]  It's wonderful.
[02:00:19.080 --> 02:00:19.920]  Yep.
[02:00:19.920 --> 02:00:24.280]  I would say maybe here's a question for myself.
[02:00:24.280 --> 02:00:28.160]  What is one loop that you guys maybe closed
[02:00:28.160 --> 02:00:31.120]  or learned how to close Brian,
[02:00:31.120 --> 02:00:33.720]  this year in terms of gardening?
[02:00:33.720 --> 02:00:36.920]  Was there a waste stream that you found
[02:00:36.920 --> 02:00:41.920]  that you converted to a product for personal use?
[02:00:44.640 --> 02:00:46.520]  Converted to a product?
[02:00:46.520 --> 02:00:48.600]  No, I would say a waste stream is
[02:00:50.480 --> 02:00:52.400]  you know, for a lot of the commercial farmers
[02:00:52.400 --> 02:00:56.000]  here in Colorado, they're not allowed to use their stems,
[02:00:56.000 --> 02:00:58.480]  their leaves, and their stalks and that kind of stuff.
[02:00:58.480 --> 02:01:00.920]  I feel like from a waste stream point of view,
[02:01:02.520 --> 02:01:05.120]  the home grower is really where that person needs to step up
[02:01:05.120 --> 02:01:08.680]  because they don't have all of those legal aspects.
[02:01:08.680 --> 02:01:10.360]  So I would point to the fact that
[02:01:10.360 --> 02:01:13.840]  if you're not spraying anything, pesticides and fungicides,
[02:01:13.840 --> 02:01:17.080]  then you should be able to replicate fall as best you can
[02:01:17.080 --> 02:01:19.400]  in your indoor environment.
[02:01:19.440 --> 02:01:20.880]  And the best way to replicate that
[02:01:20.880 --> 02:01:23.080]  is to let the leaves fall down.
[02:01:23.080 --> 02:01:24.600]  Those are going to break down
[02:01:24.600 --> 02:01:26.680]  through the soil food web, the microbes.
[02:01:26.680 --> 02:01:28.520]  And I feel like that's one way
[02:01:28.520 --> 02:01:31.200]  to kind of close that loop when you can.
[02:01:31.200 --> 02:01:33.040]  I know that some states are changing that.
[02:01:33.040 --> 02:01:34.360]  I even saw Steve was saying
[02:01:34.360 --> 02:01:36.360]  that Las Vegas might be changing that.
[02:01:36.360 --> 02:01:39.840]  So I hope that trend doesn't continue
[02:01:39.840 --> 02:01:41.960]  because I mean, what is the damn difference
[02:01:41.960 --> 02:01:43.800]  if you're putting leaves and stalks
[02:01:43.800 --> 02:01:46.080]  back onto your living soil system
[02:01:46.080 --> 02:01:47.920]  just the way mother nature does it?
[02:01:47.960 --> 02:01:50.800]  I mean, she figured it out a long, long time ago.
[02:01:50.800 --> 02:01:53.640]  So when we're trying to go against that,
[02:01:53.640 --> 02:01:55.400]  I just never really understand that
[02:01:55.400 --> 02:01:56.840]  from a farmer perspective.
[02:01:56.840 --> 02:02:00.360]  And unfortunately the legislators and lawmakers and stuff,
[02:02:01.320 --> 02:02:04.640]  they really, I mean, I had a lady when I was,
[02:02:04.640 --> 02:02:06.920]  I sat on the board of Denver Normal for a while
[02:02:06.920 --> 02:02:10.120]  and we went and lobbied the downtown Denver
[02:02:10.120 --> 02:02:11.040]  and they were asking us like,
[02:02:11.040 --> 02:02:14.240]  what's the difference between cannabis and marijuana?
[02:02:14.240 --> 02:02:17.720]  Really kind of, in my opinion, kind of eye-opening questions
[02:02:18.520 --> 02:02:20.520]  because they were making laws on this.
[02:02:21.440 --> 02:02:25.360]  So true, like that is such a scarily ignorant question
[02:02:25.360 --> 02:02:27.920]  from the person dictating how you do it.
[02:02:29.400 --> 02:02:32.720]  Wow, I'd say to answer the same question,
[02:02:32.720 --> 02:02:35.560]  we had a biochar party at my property, man.
[02:02:35.560 --> 02:02:37.720]  And a couple of the students just brought
[02:02:37.720 --> 02:02:40.280]  like their leftover stalks and stuff.
[02:02:40.280 --> 02:02:43.440]  And man, we stuffed them into a 50 gallon drum,
[02:02:43.440 --> 02:02:45.600]  like really as hard as we could pack them in there.
[02:02:45.600 --> 02:02:47.200]  And then after we charred them,
[02:02:48.080 --> 02:02:50.720]  probably a quarter of that, if that.
[02:02:50.720 --> 02:02:54.480]  So I think, obviously biochar is an amendment
[02:02:54.480 --> 02:02:57.080]  that you use sparingly,
[02:02:57.080 --> 02:02:58.720]  but I think there's some room for that
[02:02:58.720 --> 02:03:01.200]  to probably use some of those old stalks
[02:03:01.200 --> 02:03:03.240]  and things like that for char.
[02:03:04.560 --> 02:03:08.760]  I think if you got a pile that's 10 feet tall,
[02:03:08.760 --> 02:03:11.000]  I mean, if you char it, I mean, you're really coming,
[02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:15.480]  breaking it down to small percentage of what it was.
[02:03:15.520 --> 02:03:17.840]  So I think that's one thing that's pretty cool.
[02:03:17.840 --> 02:03:20.080]  And then just looking at,
[02:03:20.080 --> 02:03:22.840]  if you wanna look at local restaurants and get more,
[02:03:22.840 --> 02:03:24.400]  and if you got a big pile of wood chips,
[02:03:24.400 --> 02:03:26.800]  you need food scraps, reach out to restaurants,
[02:03:26.800 --> 02:03:28.200]  see if you can get some of their scraps.
[02:03:28.200 --> 02:03:32.360]  And maybe that's what I did when I was building my soil.
[02:03:32.360 --> 02:03:35.880]  I was getting my Bokashi in 30 gallon barrels.
[02:03:35.880 --> 02:03:38.200]  I bring them a barrel, leave it in the back of their place.
[02:03:38.200 --> 02:03:41.800]  They fill it up, take it home, kind of work it like that.
[02:03:41.800 --> 02:03:43.240]  But there's lots of ways, man.
[02:03:43.240 --> 02:03:45.040]  Lots of free stuff out there, guys.
[02:03:45.640 --> 02:03:47.080]  If you just look, use your mind,
[02:03:47.080 --> 02:03:50.640]  use that intelligent mind you got.
[02:03:51.520 --> 02:03:54.720]  You'd be surprised how people wanna reach out to you
[02:03:54.720 --> 02:03:56.200]  and you can solve a problem for them.
[02:03:56.200 --> 02:03:58.160]  So if they have a waste that they're paying for
[02:03:58.160 --> 02:04:00.840]  and you're willing to take that for free, boom,
[02:04:00.840 --> 02:04:02.560]  you got that all day.
[02:04:02.560 --> 02:04:04.640]  Oh yeah, they were calling me, man.
[02:04:04.640 --> 02:04:06.400]  We got the barrels full.
[02:04:06.400 --> 02:04:08.040]  It got to be a little bit of a chore.
[02:04:08.040 --> 02:04:09.400]  I'm like, I'm either gonna have to turn this
[02:04:09.400 --> 02:04:13.920]  into a business or kind of tell them I can't take anymore.
[02:04:13.920 --> 02:04:17.680]  But yeah, trust me, if you guys want it, man,
[02:04:17.680 --> 02:04:19.600]  there's ways to make money out there
[02:04:19.600 --> 02:04:21.720]  and you could do it off people's trash.
[02:04:25.360 --> 02:04:29.160]  Here's kind of a ingredient question is,
[02:04:29.160 --> 02:04:31.840]  what do aminos actually do for the plant?
[02:04:31.840 --> 02:04:35.240]  And if it's a super nitty gritty micro answer,
[02:04:35.240 --> 02:04:37.560]  you could give us the overview.
[02:04:37.560 --> 02:04:41.240]  And does that little like bottle of Bragg's amino acids
[02:04:41.240 --> 02:04:43.840]  I see in the grocery store, does that work?
[02:04:44.920 --> 02:04:48.800]  Well, aminos are basically gonna be like
[02:04:48.800 --> 02:04:53.080]  your building blocks, if you will, for your plants.
[02:04:53.080 --> 02:04:55.880]  Just to keep it generic, I'm not scientific,
[02:04:55.880 --> 02:04:57.400]  I'm more of your layman.
[02:04:57.400 --> 02:05:00.240]  I can give you kind of the basics.
[02:05:00.240 --> 02:05:03.880]  I will say this, there's a huge hype for aminos right now.
[02:05:03.880 --> 02:05:06.240]  And I don't know that that hype is justified.
[02:05:07.160 --> 02:05:10.700]  Think about it, I have never actively,
[02:05:11.700 --> 02:05:13.980]  like I said, I need to get aminos
[02:05:13.980 --> 02:05:16.020]  and add them to my regimen.
[02:05:16.020 --> 02:05:16.860]  You know what I mean?
[02:05:16.860 --> 02:05:18.460]  I've never actively had to do that.
[02:05:19.700 --> 02:05:22.460]  A lot of natural farming, we're using plants to make plants.
[02:05:22.460 --> 02:05:25.300]  Plants have aminos in them, they have amino acids.
[02:05:25.300 --> 02:05:28.740]  So a lot of, with our process,
[02:05:28.740 --> 02:05:30.960]  I don't think it's necessary to buy some of these things.
[02:05:30.960 --> 02:05:32.540]  I'm not gonna say they're not valuable
[02:05:32.540 --> 02:05:34.340]  and useful in the right hands.
[02:05:34.340 --> 02:05:36.340]  There's guys out there like Brandon Russ,
[02:05:36.340 --> 02:05:37.940]  there's guys that really know their shit
[02:05:37.940 --> 02:05:41.140]  and know really how to use these things.
[02:05:41.140 --> 02:05:44.180]  I'm not gonna act like I'm one of those guys.
[02:05:44.180 --> 02:05:46.300]  But do your research, you know what I mean?
[02:05:46.300 --> 02:05:47.680]  And think of the proportions,
[02:05:47.680 --> 02:05:49.660]  if someone's telling you to use these aminos
[02:05:49.660 --> 02:05:52.140]  or different things, what are the proportions you're using
[02:05:52.140 --> 02:05:54.060]  compared to the volume of your soil?
[02:05:55.340 --> 02:05:56.180]  Something like that.
[02:05:56.180 --> 02:05:59.180]  But Brian's probably got a little bit more on that than I do.
[02:06:00.500 --> 02:06:03.100]  Yeah, I mean, amino acids are basically building blocks
[02:06:03.100 --> 02:06:04.660]  that are going to improve things.
[02:06:04.660 --> 02:06:07.940]  So, you know, the reason why that's probably hyped
[02:06:07.940 --> 02:06:10.460]  and people are seeing at the beginning,
[02:06:11.340 --> 02:06:13.580]  great results with that is because it's improving
[02:06:13.580 --> 02:06:15.420]  the overall process.
[02:06:15.420 --> 02:06:17.780]  The main thing that I used amino acids would be
[02:06:17.780 --> 02:06:21.460]  to improve like calcium uptake and that kind of thing.
[02:06:21.460 --> 02:06:24.060]  The problem is, is that when you're a moron
[02:06:24.060 --> 02:06:26.660]  and you're putting that stuff on constantly,
[02:06:26.660 --> 02:06:28.560]  you're going to end up having problems.
[02:06:28.560 --> 02:06:30.380]  Does that happen in the first week, month?
[02:06:30.380 --> 02:06:31.480]  Probably not.
[02:06:31.480 --> 02:06:34.960]  But as you continue to follow that advice,
[02:06:34.960 --> 02:06:38.480]  you're going to, at the end of the day, have a lot of issues
[02:06:38.480 --> 02:06:42.240]  and I caution you guys following people
[02:06:42.240 --> 02:06:45.840]  that kind of come onto the scene real recently.
[02:06:45.840 --> 02:06:49.520]  They're educating you, but they wanna sell you things.
[02:06:49.520 --> 02:06:52.240]  There's just something to that, I feel like,
[02:06:52.240 --> 02:06:54.180]  when someone's educating, but at the same time,
[02:06:54.180 --> 02:06:56.940]  they're saying that you have to use their products,
[02:06:56.940 --> 02:06:58.600]  that should be a red flag.
[02:06:58.600 --> 02:07:02.080]  If you're a natural farmer, you're a living soil farmer
[02:07:02.080 --> 02:07:06.120]  and to Brandon Russ, he's not a living soil farmer.
[02:07:06.120 --> 02:07:07.680]  He's a dialed in,
[02:07:09.400 --> 02:07:11.880]  highly, what's the right word?
[02:07:11.880 --> 02:07:14.200]  Highly educated farmer.
[02:07:14.200 --> 02:07:17.280]  And that is what a lot of people would strive to be,
[02:07:17.280 --> 02:07:19.840]  but I assure you that's going to take you a long,
[02:07:19.840 --> 02:07:21.840]  long time to get there.
[02:07:21.840 --> 02:07:24.480]  And if you've ever listened to Brandon Russ speak,
[02:07:24.480 --> 02:07:27.600]  obviously, he's been spending his whole life
[02:07:27.600 --> 02:07:29.080]  figuring this stuff out.
[02:07:29.080 --> 02:07:30.680]  I was actually able to even talk to him
[02:07:30.680 --> 02:07:33.340]  before he became known as Brandon Russ,
[02:07:33.340 --> 02:07:35.720]  when he had just gotten out of the pen.
[02:07:35.720 --> 02:07:39.400]  And he shared with me the fact that he'd taken that time
[02:07:39.400 --> 02:07:42.200]  to really educate himself on a whole nother level.
[02:07:42.200 --> 02:07:45.500]  So if you're not going to be able to do that for yourself,
[02:07:45.500 --> 02:07:47.760]  then amino acids, you're gonna want those more
[02:07:47.760 --> 02:07:50.960]  to come from natural sources than you going out,
[02:07:50.960 --> 02:07:54.300]  buying that, flooding your grows with that kind of stuff.
[02:07:54.300 --> 02:07:57.660]  And then I can assure you behind the scenes,
[02:07:57.660 --> 02:07:59.300]  there's a lot of people that are having problems
[02:07:59.300 --> 02:08:00.500]  with that down the road.
[02:08:02.420 --> 02:08:03.260]  Definitely.
[02:08:03.260 --> 02:08:05.340]  And another thing, read up on it.
[02:08:06.660 --> 02:08:10.820]  If somebody, anybody, if you see something on my Instagram,
[02:08:10.820 --> 02:08:12.620]  if I see someone do something, right?
[02:08:12.620 --> 02:08:14.780]  And I say, okay, he's working with aminos.
[02:08:14.780 --> 02:08:18.700]  I don't, don't search what he's doing.
[02:08:18.700 --> 02:08:22.380]  Search what he's doing, what makes it up.
[02:08:22.380 --> 02:08:26.300]  So like find out from the base of what aminos are.
[02:08:26.300 --> 02:08:27.420]  Like start your reading.
[02:08:27.420 --> 02:08:29.940]  Like, in other words, a lot of people jump in
[02:08:29.940 --> 02:08:31.780]  and they say, boom, I'm in natural farm.
[02:08:31.780 --> 02:08:33.060]  Oh, I'm doing aminos.
[02:08:33.060 --> 02:08:35.580]  Well, you don't even know what they are.
[02:08:35.580 --> 02:08:39.420]  Like, so learn that before you start spending your money
[02:08:39.420 --> 02:08:41.340]  because you may end up finding that,
[02:08:41.340 --> 02:08:44.340]  wow, I've already been making just for instance,
[02:08:44.340 --> 02:08:45.980]  a comfrey FPE.
[02:08:45.980 --> 02:08:48.180]  Well, shit, that's loaded with aminos.
[02:08:48.180 --> 02:08:51.180]  So, think about it before you spend your money.
[02:08:51.180 --> 02:08:52.580]  The key thing that we,
[02:08:52.580 --> 02:08:54.620]  that I don't like to see you do is waste money.
[02:08:54.620 --> 02:08:56.940]  Like, I don't, don't waste my time
[02:08:56.940 --> 02:08:58.340]  and damn sure don't waste my money.
[02:08:58.340 --> 02:09:00.740]  Like those things are very valuable.
[02:09:01.940 --> 02:09:03.620]  Some of the things that we teach,
[02:09:03.620 --> 02:09:05.540]  hopefully we can save you time.
[02:09:05.540 --> 02:09:07.940]  And like Brian said, you get hung up in aminos,
[02:09:07.940 --> 02:09:10.300]  you get too hung up in all that.
[02:09:10.300 --> 02:09:12.780]  And then now your soil gets out of balance,
[02:09:12.780 --> 02:09:14.060]  your plants suffer.
[02:09:14.060 --> 02:09:14.940]  Well, look at the time.
[02:09:14.940 --> 02:09:16.540]  Now you got to go back in time,
[02:09:16.540 --> 02:09:19.100]  gain what you lost in your plants,
[02:09:19.100 --> 02:09:20.820]  catch back up and start over.
[02:09:21.500 --> 02:09:23.220]  So, just educating.
[02:09:23.220 --> 02:09:24.420]  And that was a great question.
[02:09:24.420 --> 02:09:26.060]  Obviously, I'm gonna tell you,
[02:09:26.060 --> 02:09:28.100]  we didn't tell you enough about aminos.
[02:09:28.100 --> 02:09:31.020]  So you need to go do some more reading on it.
[02:09:34.620 --> 02:09:36.300]  Aminos aren't the be all end all.
[02:09:36.300 --> 02:09:39.580]  They're not the, they're a bandaid, if you will.
[02:09:39.580 --> 02:09:42.460]  They're going to fix problems temporarily.
[02:09:42.460 --> 02:09:46.020]  That is a short sighted view as a farmer.
[02:09:46.020 --> 02:09:48.580]  If you're a natural farmer, living soil farmer,
[02:09:48.980 --> 02:09:51.460]  and you're getting education from someone,
[02:09:51.460 --> 02:09:53.860]  that education should be that you yourself
[02:09:53.860 --> 02:09:56.460]  are going out and getting the inputs.
[02:09:57.580 --> 02:09:59.620]  Again, if they're just pitching you products,
[02:09:59.620 --> 02:10:02.180]  I mean, there's a variety of other podcasts and stuff,
[02:10:02.180 --> 02:10:04.020]  but they're always pitching products.
[02:10:04.020 --> 02:10:07.620]  And I feel like that's why Chad, Marco and myself decided,
[02:10:07.620 --> 02:10:10.740]  hey, we're not, we're obviously not doing this for money.
[02:10:10.740 --> 02:10:12.300]  So let's make sure that there's nobody
[02:10:12.300 --> 02:10:15.060]  that's going to hover over us and influence us
[02:10:15.100 --> 02:10:18.900]  and make us maybe view things more in their favor
[02:10:18.900 --> 02:10:20.340]  because they're sponsoring us,
[02:10:20.340 --> 02:10:23.220]  or maybe talk about products because they're sponsoring us.
[02:10:23.220 --> 02:10:24.740]  Nobody sponsors us.
[02:10:24.740 --> 02:10:27.220]  And I feel that I'm really proud of that
[02:10:27.220 --> 02:10:29.420]  because we're able to sit here and talk freely,
[02:10:29.420 --> 02:10:31.860]  tell you the truth, or at least our truth.
[02:10:31.860 --> 02:10:34.180]  I'm sure there's other people that have experienced things
[02:10:34.180 --> 02:10:38.540]  in different ways, but amino acids are not the be all end all
[02:10:38.540 --> 02:10:39.380]  that is for sure.
[02:10:39.380 --> 02:10:44.380]  And it really bothers me that for some people,
[02:10:44.740 --> 02:10:46.900]  they seem like that's the route
[02:10:46.900 --> 02:10:49.300]  that cannabis is going to take.
[02:10:49.300 --> 02:10:51.260]  And I hope that you guys hear it first.
[02:10:51.260 --> 02:10:54.020]  That's not the long game plan right there.
[02:10:54.900 --> 02:10:56.460]  Yeah.
[02:10:56.460 --> 02:10:57.300]  That's good.
[02:10:57.300 --> 02:10:58.540]  And that's the gem that you mentioned
[02:10:58.540 --> 02:11:00.100]  that made it really stick in my head
[02:11:00.100 --> 02:11:02.660]  as a person who hasn't gone down that route
[02:11:02.660 --> 02:11:06.060]  or used that a lot is it's more of a band-aid.
[02:11:06.060 --> 02:11:10.620]  So don't rely on it as a solution to end all be all.
[02:11:10.620 --> 02:11:11.820]  So that's good to know.
[02:11:11.820 --> 02:11:13.460]  Because again, a lot of these things,
[02:11:13.500 --> 02:11:15.020]  we don't want to consistently do.
[02:11:15.020 --> 02:11:16.420]  It's all about moderation.
[02:11:18.020 --> 02:11:20.620]  And something that I've seen you do here on the show,
[02:11:20.620 --> 02:11:23.780]  Marco, I got a question for you
[02:11:23.780 --> 02:11:26.700]  about your special magic drink.
[02:11:28.900 --> 02:11:31.620]  Well, the wife and I will go undiluted.
[02:11:31.620 --> 02:11:34.460]  We'll go a little shot in the mornings undiluted.
[02:11:34.460 --> 02:11:36.500]  But let me give you this.
[02:11:36.500 --> 02:11:39.620]  What I do is I drink it undiluted because I like the taste,
[02:11:39.620 --> 02:11:42.180]  but followed up with some water, a glass of water.
[02:11:43.180 --> 02:11:45.820]  I got a little, I was probably sipping it every morning.
[02:11:45.820 --> 02:11:49.380]  I think I got a little bit too OHN-y,
[02:11:49.380 --> 02:11:50.220]  you know what I mean?
[02:11:50.220 --> 02:11:51.700]  Too much into the OHN.
[02:11:51.700 --> 02:11:55.420]  And I actually was getting a little bit of stomach ache.
[02:11:55.420 --> 02:11:56.260]  So be careful.
[02:11:56.260 --> 02:11:58.020]  It's very powerful.
[02:11:58.020 --> 02:11:58.860]  If you take a shot,
[02:11:58.860 --> 02:12:01.140]  follow it up with a 16 ounce glass of water.
[02:12:01.140 --> 02:12:02.060]  It's all good.
[02:12:02.060 --> 02:12:03.620]  Back to moderation.
[02:12:03.620 --> 02:12:05.380]  Back to moderation right there.
[02:12:05.380 --> 02:12:06.220]  Exactly.
[02:12:06.220 --> 02:12:07.500]  And back to water too.
[02:12:07.500 --> 02:12:09.020]  This was a question for when you're putting
[02:12:09.060 --> 02:12:14.060]  your cardboard down as the cover or the multilayer there,
[02:12:14.060 --> 02:12:16.340]  do you water it first or you just put it down dry?
[02:12:16.340 --> 02:12:19.660]  And are you looking for one without printed ink on it?
[02:12:19.660 --> 02:12:20.540]  Well, here we go.
[02:12:20.540 --> 02:12:21.380]  Boom.
[02:12:21.380 --> 02:12:23.660]  So if you really want to get sweet with it,
[02:12:23.660 --> 02:12:25.660]  you can take your cardboard and soak it.
[02:12:25.660 --> 02:12:29.220]  Like she said, soak it in some damn natural farming inputs.
[02:12:29.220 --> 02:12:30.060]  You know what I mean?
[02:12:30.060 --> 02:12:33.060]  Make it just like you're going to do an IMO pile.
[02:12:34.020 --> 02:12:35.340]  Soak it in a bin.
[02:12:35.340 --> 02:12:38.780]  Have that cardboard nice and sloppy, then lay it down.
[02:12:39.540 --> 02:12:40.380]  Hell yeah.
[02:12:40.380 --> 02:12:41.220]  I like that idea.
[02:12:41.220 --> 02:12:42.740]  That's how you think with natural farming.
[02:12:42.740 --> 02:12:46.220]  Like I did literally just came up with that
[02:12:46.220 --> 02:12:48.980]  when she said that because that's such a dope idea.
[02:12:48.980 --> 02:12:52.420]  And so now when I do my cardboard, I'm going to...
[02:12:52.420 --> 02:12:53.260]  Thank you.
[02:12:53.260 --> 02:12:54.100]  Who said that?
[02:12:54.100 --> 02:12:55.420]  I want to shut them up.
[02:12:57.460 --> 02:12:59.060]  Well, anyway, yes.
[02:12:59.060 --> 02:13:00.220]  Hi, Faye Huntress.
[02:13:00.220 --> 02:13:01.060]  Thank you.
[02:13:01.060 --> 02:13:03.900]  And hit me up on Instagram with that.
[02:13:03.900 --> 02:13:05.740]  Tell me you said that, cause that's awesome.
[02:13:05.740 --> 02:13:06.580]  I like it.
[02:13:08.980 --> 02:13:11.540]  Yeah, that's how that natural farming mind works though, man.
[02:13:11.540 --> 02:13:13.660]  What you do is you just take every little thing
[02:13:13.660 --> 02:13:15.580]  and you say, how can it be a little better?
[02:13:15.580 --> 02:13:17.740]  How can it break down a little faster?
[02:13:17.740 --> 02:13:20.220]  Like Brian says, buying yourself time.
[02:13:20.220 --> 02:13:22.940]  Now, when we wet that cardboard, we bought ourselves time
[02:13:22.940 --> 02:13:25.100]  because now really that's going to make contact
[02:13:25.100 --> 02:13:27.060]  with the soil a lot faster.
[02:13:27.060 --> 02:13:29.300]  It's really going to smother those roots,
[02:13:29.300 --> 02:13:30.740]  those weeds and stuff, man.
[02:13:30.740 --> 02:13:33.740]  So I think shit like that is, I think that's dope.
[02:13:33.740 --> 02:13:34.580]  I love that.
[02:13:35.580 --> 02:13:37.220]  And I like that you mentioned too,
[02:13:37.220 --> 02:13:40.420]  potentially just even soaking it in some of your inoculants
[02:13:40.420 --> 02:13:42.900]  because that's, I mean, like buffering cocoa.
[02:13:42.900 --> 02:13:44.140]  That's the first thing that came to my head.
[02:13:44.140 --> 02:13:45.620]  It's like, you're buffering the cardboard.
[02:13:45.620 --> 02:13:46.460]  Right, right.
[02:13:46.460 --> 02:13:47.300]  Buffering it, that's right.
[02:13:47.300 --> 02:13:48.140]  Yeah.
[02:13:48.140 --> 02:13:49.540]  You're getting it pre-charged.
[02:13:49.540 --> 02:13:50.380]  That's what it is.
[02:13:50.380 --> 02:13:51.220]  Yes, sir.
[02:13:51.220 --> 02:13:52.380]  And to that last little bit,
[02:13:52.380 --> 02:13:54.420]  yes, you want to try to find cardboard
[02:13:54.420 --> 02:13:56.660]  that doesn't have a lot of coloring on it.
[02:13:56.660 --> 02:13:58.220]  A little black ink is okay,
[02:13:58.220 --> 02:14:00.940]  but I usually try to find the cardboard
[02:14:00.940 --> 02:14:03.500]  where the company's using the soy ink.
[02:14:04.500 --> 02:14:05.340]  Right.
[02:14:05.340 --> 02:14:09.180]  It seems like that's just a better all around play.
[02:14:09.180 --> 02:14:10.020]  That's true.
[02:14:10.020 --> 02:14:12.020]  And very valid point, Brian.
[02:14:12.020 --> 02:14:15.260]  And definitely try to avoid the shiny slick cardboard,
[02:14:15.260 --> 02:14:18.940]  you know, with the TV boxes, you know how they are.
[02:14:18.940 --> 02:14:21.460]  And I think a lot of them use that soy ink now,
[02:14:21.460 --> 02:14:23.140]  which is cool.
[02:14:23.140 --> 02:14:24.500]  Someone told me once before,
[02:14:24.500 --> 02:14:27.220]  soaking cardboard is an easy way to get the tape off.
[02:14:27.220 --> 02:14:29.060]  So now we're kind of doing a two for one.
[02:14:29.060 --> 02:14:30.460]  We're getting inoculant in there,
[02:14:30.460 --> 02:14:32.780]  pull the tape, lay it down.
[02:14:33.220 --> 02:14:34.060]  I like it.
[02:14:34.060 --> 02:14:35.900]  Cardboard tech.
[02:14:35.900 --> 02:14:36.740]  Yes.
[02:14:36.740 --> 02:14:38.580]  So from everything-
[02:14:38.580 --> 02:14:40.140]  You invented that, Marco.
[02:14:40.140 --> 02:14:41.460]  Yes, I invented that.
[02:14:41.460 --> 02:14:44.060]  I'm getting a t-shirt, it's on.
[02:14:44.060 --> 02:14:47.220]  Cardboardtech.com just got purchased.
[02:14:48.940 --> 02:14:50.300]  And then the answer to this one,
[02:14:50.300 --> 02:14:52.180]  I'm pretty sure is yes.
[02:14:52.180 --> 02:14:53.340]  Do the soils mature?
[02:14:53.340 --> 02:14:55.380]  They become better with no till.
[02:14:57.380 --> 02:15:01.380]  Because again, the networks of mycelium,
[02:15:01.420 --> 02:15:04.820]  networks of mycelium, mycorrhizae in there.
[02:15:06.340 --> 02:15:08.980]  How far deep do you have to go to disturb that,
[02:15:08.980 --> 02:15:10.660]  to actually maybe cause some damage?
[02:15:10.660 --> 02:15:12.420]  Like if I'm scratching stuff in
[02:15:12.420 --> 02:15:14.180]  and I'm getting a good inch or so down
[02:15:14.180 --> 02:15:16.940]  to maybe break up like a crust layer,
[02:15:16.940 --> 02:15:20.580]  am I doing more damage than benefit?
[02:15:20.580 --> 02:15:21.420]  No, that's good.
[02:15:21.420 --> 02:15:22.740]  You're good with that.
[02:15:22.740 --> 02:15:25.140]  I feel like if you're going in there inches,
[02:15:25.140 --> 02:15:27.300]  like I'd probably say an inch
[02:15:27.300 --> 02:15:29.020]  once you start getting down there.
[02:15:29.020 --> 02:15:31.020]  Because what will happen is if you look into a good,
[02:15:31.740 --> 02:15:35.060]  like my outdoor beds, if I had to kind of scratch into them,
[02:15:35.060 --> 02:15:38.340]  I can see mycelium at about an inch or two down.
[02:15:38.340 --> 02:15:39.180]  Just depends.
[02:15:39.180 --> 02:15:40.980]  Sometimes it's directly under the leaves.
[02:15:40.980 --> 02:15:44.020]  So you might have a leaf layer, lightly move those leaves.
[02:15:44.020 --> 02:15:47.220]  You might have mycelium directly there.
[02:15:48.620 --> 02:15:50.980]  Just try to disturb it as little as possible, man.
[02:15:50.980 --> 02:15:54.260]  I don't like to disturb my soil unless I have to.
[02:15:55.700 --> 02:15:57.420]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:15:57.420 --> 02:15:59.420]  The less you're doing, the better.
[02:15:59.460 --> 02:16:01.620]  I even think that's why,
[02:16:01.620 --> 02:16:03.220]  I guess I'm talking about Steve a lot today,
[02:16:03.220 --> 02:16:05.020]  but that's the why he even went,
[02:16:05.980 --> 02:16:09.340]  thinking outside the box, I guess in a way,
[02:16:09.340 --> 02:16:10.820]  is to have the living soil bed
[02:16:10.820 --> 02:16:12.860]  and then to have the fabric pots
[02:16:12.860 --> 02:16:15.060]  on top of that living soil bed.
[02:16:15.060 --> 02:16:17.980]  So that he gets all the benefits of a living soil system
[02:16:17.980 --> 02:16:19.860]  without disturbing that.
[02:16:19.860 --> 02:16:21.700]  And again, that's very simplistic,
[02:16:21.700 --> 02:16:24.660]  but at the same time, extremely brilliant.
[02:16:24.660 --> 02:16:26.700]  Especially at the commercial side of things.
[02:16:26.700 --> 02:16:28.060]  Yeah, think about that.
[02:16:28.060 --> 02:16:29.500]  That's smart as hell.
[02:16:29.500 --> 02:16:31.820]  So he has all these bottomless pots.
[02:16:31.820 --> 02:16:34.900]  So when it's time to freaking put a pot to the big boys,
[02:16:34.900 --> 02:16:36.900]  he just sets them on top of the living soil
[02:16:36.900 --> 02:16:37.980]  and they rock out.
[02:16:37.980 --> 02:16:40.140]  Just cuts those roots that have come out of there.
[02:16:40.140 --> 02:16:41.980]  And remember, cannabis loves to grow
[02:16:41.980 --> 02:16:45.700]  more on a width side than deep down.
[02:16:45.700 --> 02:16:47.980]  So a lot of the stuff that you're gonna see,
[02:16:47.980 --> 02:16:48.820]  like Marco had mentioned,
[02:16:48.820 --> 02:16:51.700]  is just really in that rhizosphere, that real magic part,
[02:16:51.700 --> 02:16:53.740]  which is probably like two to six inches,
[02:16:53.740 --> 02:16:55.580]  depending on how old your system is.
[02:16:56.580 --> 02:16:57.820]  Very well, yeah.
[02:16:57.820 --> 02:17:01.180]  One, for instance, just in a living soil bed,
[02:17:01.180 --> 02:17:04.260]  I was surprised, but the roots will grow
[02:17:04.260 --> 02:17:05.820]  down through the bottom horizon,
[02:17:05.820 --> 02:17:07.140]  the sand and gravel layer,
[02:17:07.140 --> 02:17:08.820]  and come out the side of the bag, man.
[02:17:08.820 --> 02:17:11.640]  So I was really surprised to see that.
[02:17:12.820 --> 02:17:15.860]  Yeah, a healthy plant will take off.
[02:17:15.860 --> 02:17:19.780]  And I think that's maybe more of that buffer of education,
[02:17:19.780 --> 02:17:22.540]  where you kind of screw things up maybe a little bit,
[02:17:22.540 --> 02:17:25.420]  but the plant can still kind of take hold.
[02:17:26.260 --> 02:17:27.300]  When you are growing synthetically,
[02:17:27.300 --> 02:17:29.940]  your pH is off, maybe you didn't.
[02:17:31.060 --> 02:17:35.860]  Let's be honest, when I was synthetic farming,
[02:17:35.860 --> 02:17:38.920]  sometimes it'd be like, I'll get to it in the morning.
[02:17:38.920 --> 02:17:41.040]  Or I went out late last night,
[02:17:41.040 --> 02:17:43.340]  and I'm gonna do it at noon.
[02:17:43.340 --> 02:17:46.220]  And because those plants are so dependent on you,
[02:17:46.220 --> 02:17:48.340]  it's just a lot of things that can build up,
[02:17:48.340 --> 02:17:50.560]  where when you're using that living soil system,
[02:17:50.560 --> 02:17:54.260]  since that soil food web is taking care of those plants,
[02:17:54.260 --> 02:17:56.060]  they're constantly being fed.
[02:17:56.060 --> 02:17:58.660]  There's such a paradigm shift
[02:17:58.660 --> 02:18:00.100]  when you're farming synthetically,
[02:18:00.100 --> 02:18:01.940]  you're thinking week by week.
[02:18:01.940 --> 02:18:03.660]  Like I need to feed them this this week,
[02:18:03.660 --> 02:18:05.580]  I need to feed them this the second week,
[02:18:05.580 --> 02:18:06.860]  and on and on and on.
[02:18:06.860 --> 02:18:08.660]  With a living soil system,
[02:18:08.660 --> 02:18:11.860]  we're really more thinking about improving each week,
[02:18:11.860 --> 02:18:14.500]  improving each month, so that as the years go by,
[02:18:14.500 --> 02:18:16.460]  this thing really starts to churn.
[02:18:16.460 --> 02:18:18.780]  And I really feel like that's the big difference
[02:18:18.780 --> 02:18:21.900]  between synthetic farming and living soil farming.
[02:18:21.900 --> 02:18:23.620]  If your skillset isn't there,
[02:18:24.860 --> 02:18:27.320]  living soil is just gonna be so much easier for you to do.
[02:18:27.320 --> 02:18:29.260]  And we could talk about all the benefits,
[02:18:29.260 --> 02:18:31.100]  the better the genetics seem to be,
[02:18:31.100 --> 02:18:33.340]  the healthier the plants seem to be,
[02:18:33.340 --> 02:18:36.040]  unless you are a high level farmer.
[02:18:36.040 --> 02:18:38.020]  But again, you're not gonna be able to achieve that
[02:18:38.020 --> 02:18:39.660]  in just a couple of years.
[02:18:39.660 --> 02:18:40.980]  It's really silly.
[02:18:42.900 --> 02:18:44.300]  I just feel like a lot of people think like,
[02:18:44.300 --> 02:18:45.740]  hey man, I'm just gonna stick this in the ground,
[02:18:45.740 --> 02:18:46.620]  I'm gonna get rich.
[02:18:46.620 --> 02:18:48.920]  And I still see that in the newer states,
[02:18:48.920 --> 02:18:50.420]  or the suits, if you will.
[02:18:50.420 --> 02:18:53.260]  They think like, oh, I got this master grower
[02:18:53.260 --> 02:18:55.180]  and we spent all this money on this facility.
[02:18:55.180 --> 02:18:56.180]  But at the end of the day,
[02:18:56.180 --> 02:18:59.020]  if that master grower doesn't have the work ethic
[02:18:59.020 --> 02:19:02.740]  to really get those plants where they need to be,
[02:19:02.740 --> 02:19:05.780]  synthetic farming can be a nightmare at the commercial level.
[02:19:07.740 --> 02:19:09.620]  The skillset, I always wanna caveat that
[02:19:09.620 --> 02:19:12.420]  because there's a fantastic synthetic farmers out there.
[02:19:12.420 --> 02:19:14.520]  I'm not taking anything away from you guys.
[02:19:14.520 --> 02:19:17.960]  It's just that the newer farmers, they just,
[02:19:17.960 --> 02:19:19.700]  I mean, who wants to put four or five years
[02:19:20.020 --> 02:19:21.780]  into something that I personally feel
[02:19:21.780 --> 02:19:23.440]  is kind of like a dying art.
[02:19:24.580 --> 02:19:27.060]  Synthetics, I don't think are going to be
[02:19:27.060 --> 02:19:30.100]  where it is for the small time farmer
[02:19:30.100 --> 02:19:33.420]  that's wanting to grow for medicinal aspects.
[02:19:34.580 --> 02:19:37.220]  Going for that fine quality craft cannabis,
[02:19:37.220 --> 02:19:40.100]  which is gonna be the differentiator
[02:19:40.100 --> 02:19:42.780]  if you plan on being in business going forward
[02:19:42.780 --> 02:19:45.080]  once the big people come in on board.
[02:19:46.900 --> 02:19:48.660]  You gotta be different.
[02:19:48.820 --> 02:19:51.420]  Here's a question that you could probably answer for us,
[02:19:51.420 --> 02:19:55.860]  Brian, isopods can't seem to climb masking tape,
[02:19:55.860 --> 02:19:56.780]  if that helps anyone.
[02:19:56.780 --> 02:19:58.780]  Is that a good thing or something that maybe Marco,
[02:19:58.780 --> 02:20:00.780]  you use to keep them away from your stem?
[02:20:03.280 --> 02:20:05.500]  I see people using that on the grays
[02:20:05.500 --> 02:20:07.860]  when the grays get crazy.
[02:20:07.860 --> 02:20:12.740]  But no, you see me, I did a clay cast.
[02:20:12.740 --> 02:20:16.060]  I made a freaking clay cast and that was what I use.
[02:20:16.060 --> 02:20:17.700]  I didn't even wanna harm the isopods
[02:20:17.700 --> 02:20:19.300]  that were eating my stalks.
[02:20:19.300 --> 02:20:22.020]  Because the only reason they did that
[02:20:22.020 --> 02:20:25.060]  is because I had neglected this bed
[02:20:25.060 --> 02:20:29.040]  and I wasn't giving it enough moisture.
[02:20:29.040 --> 02:20:31.580]  People gotta realize isopods are like crabs,
[02:20:31.580 --> 02:20:35.020]  they're like from the ocean,
[02:20:35.020 --> 02:20:38.060]  meaning they need to have moisture to breathe.
[02:20:38.060 --> 02:20:40.180]  If they don't get enough moisture in your soil
[02:20:40.180 --> 02:20:43.380]  or you're not putting enough organic material,
[02:20:43.380 --> 02:20:47.060]  they will chew stalks because stalks have moisture.
[02:20:48.020 --> 02:20:50.420]  So I blame myself as a farmer on that,
[02:20:50.420 --> 02:20:51.260]  you know what I mean?
[02:20:51.260 --> 02:20:55.260]  I have isopods in every soil and they're gray.
[02:20:55.260 --> 02:20:57.540]  Some of them I got the fancy ones I got for Brian,
[02:20:57.540 --> 02:21:00.300]  but a lot of them are just grays or average.
[02:21:00.300 --> 02:21:01.820]  And I never had any problems.
[02:21:01.820 --> 02:21:04.620]  And I actually have two plants in the same bed.
[02:21:04.620 --> 02:21:07.220]  One of them, they ate the stalk, one they did not.
[02:21:07.220 --> 02:21:11.300]  And I really think it was the low hanging vegetation.
[02:21:11.300 --> 02:21:12.260]  I didn't trim it.
[02:21:12.260 --> 02:21:14.500]  I had it kind of like a jungle on the ground,
[02:21:14.500 --> 02:21:16.620]  the stalk had stuff all around it.
[02:21:16.620 --> 02:21:19.520]  It kind of just gave them a buffet to walk right up to it.
[02:21:21.140 --> 02:21:23.860]  The gray ones are gonna probably cause you issues.
[02:21:23.860 --> 02:21:25.640]  The designer isopods,
[02:21:25.640 --> 02:21:27.700]  I wish they bred as quickly as the grays,
[02:21:27.700 --> 02:21:30.100]  I'd be a wealthy, wealthy man.
[02:21:30.100 --> 02:21:33.380]  The designer isopods just don't breed that quickly
[02:21:33.380 --> 02:21:34.600]  so you can have them.
[02:21:35.620 --> 02:21:37.880]  In an indoor environment, if I had an isopod problem,
[02:21:37.880 --> 02:21:39.340]  I would get one of these.
[02:21:39.340 --> 02:21:41.220]  This is known as a bearded dragon.
[02:21:41.220 --> 02:21:44.380]  This guy will eat isopods all day long.
[02:21:44.380 --> 02:21:46.900]  On a commercial facility, if you can,
[02:21:46.900 --> 02:21:48.580]  chickens will also do the same thing.
[02:21:48.580 --> 02:21:51.620]  They'll just eat those gray isopods all day long.
[02:21:51.620 --> 02:21:53.060]  So again, it's just another way
[02:21:53.060 --> 02:21:56.100]  that you're able to kind of close that loop.
[02:21:56.100 --> 02:21:59.140]  And I mean, this little guy right here,
[02:21:59.140 --> 02:22:01.140]  he's kind of an exotic one,
[02:22:01.140 --> 02:22:03.060]  but you can get one of these guys for like 50 bucks,
[02:22:03.060 --> 02:22:03.940]  a hundred bucks.
[02:22:03.940 --> 02:22:05.140]  This guy costs a little bit more,
[02:22:05.140 --> 02:22:09.140]  but these are my kids toy.
[02:22:09.220 --> 02:22:14.220]  But yeah, a bearded dragon will eat isopods constantly
[02:22:14.260 --> 02:22:15.500]  and they love to hunt.
[02:22:15.500 --> 02:22:17.580]  So it's exciting for them as well.
[02:22:17.580 --> 02:22:20.740]  So if you're a tent grower, a basement grower,
[02:22:20.740 --> 02:22:23.180]  or if you're a commercial farmer and they'll let you,
[02:22:23.180 --> 02:22:25.300]  I'd get a couple of bearded dragons, let them run around.
[02:22:25.300 --> 02:22:28.180]  They're extremely intelligent, just like the lion head.
[02:22:30.020 --> 02:22:31.900]  You can see he's just chilling here
[02:22:31.900 --> 02:22:36.660]  and he will decimate an isopod issue.
[02:22:36.700 --> 02:22:40.180]  So I have seen some people use masking tape.
[02:22:40.180 --> 02:22:42.380]  I've personally seen that you can use beer.
[02:22:42.380 --> 02:22:44.740]  They seem to just kind of fall into the beer,
[02:22:46.060 --> 02:22:49.660]  but I personally would use some kind of predator
[02:22:49.660 --> 02:22:51.640]  like a chicken or a bearded dragon.
[02:22:52.540 --> 02:22:54.900]  And that bearded dragon idea sounds pretty cool
[02:22:54.900 --> 02:22:56.340]  because if you're gonna pay somebody
[02:22:56.340 --> 02:22:57.540]  in a commercial facility,
[02:22:57.540 --> 02:22:59.100]  what's the difference in paying that guy
[02:22:59.100 --> 02:23:00.860]  to spray a chemical or paying that guy
[02:23:00.860 --> 02:23:04.140]  to watch the bearded dragon eat for two hours,
[02:23:04.140 --> 02:23:05.220]  monitor where he's at,
[02:23:05.220 --> 02:23:07.540]  move him to the next bed and shit.
[02:23:07.540 --> 02:23:09.180]  Those are kind of things I think are,
[02:23:09.180 --> 02:23:12.540]  those can be revolutionary type tactics, man.
[02:23:12.540 --> 02:23:13.820]  You know what I mean?
[02:23:13.820 --> 02:23:15.420]  Chickens are messy as hell.
[02:23:15.420 --> 02:23:17.380]  They'll scratch your shit all up,
[02:23:17.380 --> 02:23:20.740]  but I'm sure there's folks probably using them
[02:23:20.740 --> 02:23:22.420]  on an outdoor-
[02:23:22.420 --> 02:23:24.500]  Yeah, I would only use obviously chickens
[02:23:24.500 --> 02:23:25.460]  on an outdoor facility.
[02:23:25.460 --> 02:23:27.660]  And again, that's gotta be a major infestation.
[02:23:27.660 --> 02:23:30.300]  Otherwise I'd use a bearded dragon outdoors.
[02:23:30.300 --> 02:23:32.060]  It is amazing how much these little guys will eat
[02:23:32.060 --> 02:23:33.380]  and they'll climb up the plant,
[02:23:33.380 --> 02:23:35.740]  just like a praying mantis or something,
[02:23:35.740 --> 02:23:36.580]  and just hang there.
[02:23:36.580 --> 02:23:39.540]  And this guy will practically eat anything,
[02:23:39.540 --> 02:23:41.100]  kind of like a praying mantis as well.
[02:23:41.100 --> 02:23:43.220]  If it's moving, he'll chomp on it.
[02:23:44.540 --> 02:23:45.380]  Nice.
[02:23:45.380 --> 02:23:46.200]  That would be cool.
[02:23:46.200 --> 02:23:47.900]  That would be cool to watch.
[02:23:47.900 --> 02:23:49.620]  And here's a question.
[02:23:49.620 --> 02:23:52.540]  Again, it's not specific enough,
[02:23:52.540 --> 02:23:56.260]  but maybe relate it to your particular practice.
[02:23:56.260 --> 02:23:57.900]  You know, this doesn't say soil, cocoa,
[02:23:57.900 --> 02:24:00.780]  hydroponic, aeroponic, any of that.
[02:24:00.780 --> 02:24:02.540]  In your particular system,
[02:24:02.540 --> 02:24:06.380]  do you guys use any silica product or supplement?
[02:24:06.380 --> 02:24:08.140]  I've heard, I think I've heard you say
[02:24:08.140 --> 02:24:09.820]  horsetails, Brian, before.
[02:24:11.580 --> 02:24:13.180]  Horsetails is a good one.
[02:24:13.180 --> 02:24:16.140]  I use, yes, I supplement silica.
[02:24:16.140 --> 02:24:19.940]  Someone sent me a product called Silica Earth
[02:24:19.940 --> 02:24:22.540]  and appreciate that.
[02:24:22.540 --> 02:24:24.020]  It was a great product.
[02:24:24.020 --> 02:24:26.300]  It had lots of silica, obviously,
[02:24:26.300 --> 02:24:28.460]  and it had lots of micronutrients in it.
[02:24:28.700 --> 02:24:33.300]  What I do is I take bamboo
[02:24:33.300 --> 02:24:35.900]  and then I'll run it through my wood chipper.
[02:24:35.900 --> 02:24:37.660]  And then I'll get, you know,
[02:24:37.660 --> 02:24:40.700]  that'll be part of my top dress, the shredded bamboo.
[02:24:40.700 --> 02:24:43.180]  Bamboo's high in silica too, if people didn't know that.
[02:24:43.180 --> 02:24:44.920]  So what I do on my top dress,
[02:24:44.920 --> 02:24:48.100]  I do a bamboo shredded, alfalfa,
[02:24:48.100 --> 02:24:51.340]  and then mix in some clays and some IMO,
[02:24:51.340 --> 02:24:53.700]  just depending on what I got going on,
[02:24:53.700 --> 02:24:55.620]  make a nice top dress.
[02:24:55.620 --> 02:24:57.580]  But yeah, I like the use of silica,
[02:24:57.580 --> 02:24:59.540]  but you don't have to buy it.
[02:24:59.540 --> 02:25:00.740]  You can if you need to.
[02:25:01.580 --> 02:25:03.020]  Yeah, definitely.
[02:25:03.020 --> 02:25:05.380]  I would say, try not to buy it
[02:25:05.380 --> 02:25:07.340]  and just kind of build your soil system.
[02:25:07.340 --> 02:25:09.500]  And like Dr. Elaine Ingham says,
[02:25:09.500 --> 02:25:13.220]  there's really enough of everything that you need in there.
[02:25:13.220 --> 02:25:16.060]  You just need the little machines to mine it for you.
[02:25:16.060 --> 02:25:17.500]  And that's the microbial world.
[02:25:17.500 --> 02:25:20.820]  So if we get that microbial world up, refined,
[02:25:20.820 --> 02:25:23.900]  and doing things at the speed that keeps up
[02:25:23.900 --> 02:25:25.620]  with the cannabis plant,
[02:25:25.620 --> 02:25:27.860]  then that's why you don't see any deficiencies.
[02:25:27.860 --> 02:25:30.340]  You don't see silica deficiencies in living soil
[02:25:31.180 --> 02:25:33.620]  because everything is being mined, if you will.
[02:25:34.860 --> 02:25:36.860]  And then that probably answers this question,
[02:25:36.860 --> 02:25:40.260]  is it sounds like you guys are applying it in the water
[02:25:40.260 --> 02:25:43.460]  instead of actually doing like a foliar spray with it.
[02:25:44.340 --> 02:25:47.580]  Well, my answer is top dress, like a physical mulch.
[02:25:47.580 --> 02:25:48.620]  Okay. Yeah.
[02:25:48.620 --> 02:25:50.140]  Exactly.
[02:25:50.140 --> 02:25:54.380]  I think that's the best play is to top feed
[02:25:54.420 --> 02:25:56.260]  almost everything that you're doing.
[02:25:56.260 --> 02:25:58.980]  I do foliar feed, like when we're doing consulting,
[02:25:58.980 --> 02:26:00.940]  let's say there's some issues,
[02:26:00.940 --> 02:26:03.900]  a little bit of Epson salt and some yucca extract
[02:26:03.900 --> 02:26:06.540]  will really improve the overall look of your plant.
[02:26:06.540 --> 02:26:08.860]  And then that plant will start to take up
[02:26:08.860 --> 02:26:10.340]  more of those trace minerals.
[02:26:11.540 --> 02:26:12.740]  Yeah. And the important,
[02:26:12.740 --> 02:26:15.620]  just to go back to the importance of the O horizon,
[02:26:15.620 --> 02:26:17.660]  I call it, I build a horizontal soil,
[02:26:17.660 --> 02:26:19.980]  O meaning organic, my top layer,
[02:26:19.980 --> 02:26:21.900]  that layer where you see the plants growing
[02:26:21.900 --> 02:26:24.020]  and the leaves and the mulch and all that.
[02:26:25.180 --> 02:26:28.500]  I start out with a four inch layer each run,
[02:26:28.500 --> 02:26:32.260]  a four inch layer of this alfalfa, bamboo, clay,
[02:26:32.260 --> 02:26:34.580]  IMO type mix as my top mulch.
[02:26:34.580 --> 02:26:38.420]  And I'm just now out of edge four weeks
[02:26:38.420 --> 02:26:42.100]  and two of those four inches now when you dig down there
[02:26:42.100 --> 02:26:45.140]  are to the point you can't tell the difference.
[02:26:45.140 --> 02:26:47.340]  So that's how much the soil shredders
[02:26:47.340 --> 02:26:51.300]  have shredded that mulch layer in just a few weeks.
[02:26:51.300 --> 02:26:53.060]  Them shredding that mulch layer now,
[02:26:53.060 --> 02:26:55.100]  they've eaten that silica and the bamboo,
[02:26:55.100 --> 02:26:56.300]  they pooped all that out.
[02:26:56.300 --> 02:26:59.300]  And that's where our plants are getting all the nutrients.
[02:26:59.300 --> 02:27:01.380]  A neat side note to that.
[02:27:01.380 --> 02:27:04.980]  When I planted my plants, they were four inches.
[02:27:04.980 --> 02:27:08.140]  Okay. So if you picture this four inch mulch,
[02:27:08.140 --> 02:27:10.820]  I dug down a depression to get that down
[02:27:10.820 --> 02:27:13.100]  to the layer of soil below.
[02:27:13.100 --> 02:27:15.100]  So when I planted my plants,
[02:27:15.100 --> 02:27:18.140]  they're not in the alfalfa mix.
[02:27:18.140 --> 02:27:20.940]  The roots of the plants are now grown up
[02:27:20.940 --> 02:27:24.140]  above the level of the soil into the mulch.
[02:27:24.140 --> 02:27:26.820]  So the plant roots actually have gone up
[02:27:26.820 --> 02:27:29.500]  above the surface of the soil into this mulch layer.
[02:27:29.500 --> 02:27:33.060]  So that's how important I feel like that shredder layer is.
[02:27:33.060 --> 02:27:35.660]  You know, I think that's a valuable nutrient source.
[02:27:37.180 --> 02:27:39.340]  Yeah. Cause so many people get afraid of shredders
[02:27:39.340 --> 02:27:42.140]  like cause they have issues like you had mentioned Marco.
[02:27:43.060 --> 02:27:45.780]  But once you start to understand that maybe it's the
[02:27:45.780 --> 02:27:47.580]  the actual species of that shredder
[02:27:47.580 --> 02:27:48.740]  that's causing those issues.
[02:27:48.780 --> 02:27:49.620]  And if you go out of your way
[02:27:49.620 --> 02:27:51.940]  to get a better quality shredder,
[02:27:52.860 --> 02:27:55.820]  even like little millipedes and stuff, those go a long way.
[02:27:55.820 --> 02:27:59.220]  But some people are afraid to add those into their system.
[02:27:59.220 --> 02:28:00.740]  Yeah. I got tons of those in there.
[02:28:00.740 --> 02:28:02.100]  They're just as you said, I mean
[02:28:02.100 --> 02:28:04.180]  a healthy system is going to have millipedes.
[02:28:04.180 --> 02:28:07.380]  Yeah. And remember centipedes are poisonous by the way.
[02:28:07.380 --> 02:28:09.700]  Millipedes are totally different.
[02:28:09.700 --> 02:28:10.540]  Yeah. Yeah.
[02:28:10.540 --> 02:28:13.660]  Millipedes are like eat fungus and wood
[02:28:13.660 --> 02:28:14.820]  wood and stuff like that.
[02:28:14.820 --> 02:28:16.780]  Where the centipedes actually are predators.
[02:28:16.780 --> 02:28:18.300]  And I have them occasionally.
[02:28:18.860 --> 02:28:21.660]  I haven't seen any of my indoor stuff, but like they're
[02:28:21.660 --> 02:28:25.260]  yeah, I see them running around all over the soil outdoors.
[02:28:28.640 --> 02:28:31.600]  This is just kind of random question back on the drying.
[02:28:31.600 --> 02:28:32.880]  I'm just scrolling through.
[02:28:32.880 --> 02:28:37.520]  I get more BPD for drying temp humidity.
[02:28:37.520 --> 02:28:40.040]  Do you guys follow any specific regimen?
[02:28:40.040 --> 02:28:43.200]  60 and 60 is kind of the generic.
[02:28:44.520 --> 02:28:48.840]  My personally right now my humidity is really low
[02:28:48.840 --> 02:28:51.280]  but my humidity is usually a little bit higher than that.
[02:28:51.280 --> 02:28:55.040]  When I dry just the way it is.
[02:28:55.040 --> 02:28:57.240]  And that's, you know, it's never been an issue.
[02:28:57.240 --> 02:28:59.320]  And I always, at least for me, I always say
[02:28:59.320 --> 02:29:00.760]  again, it always depends.
[02:29:00.760 --> 02:29:02.600]  Are you in a place of low humidity
[02:29:02.600 --> 02:29:04.760]  or are you in a place of high humidity?
[02:29:04.760 --> 02:29:05.600]  Right.
[02:29:05.600 --> 02:29:07.200]  That makes a difference.
[02:29:07.200 --> 02:29:09.440]  But do you do anything specific Marco
[02:29:09.440 --> 02:29:12.080]  or do you just kind of make sure to keep an eye on it
[02:29:12.080 --> 02:29:14.480]  and things don't get too far out of control?
[02:29:14.480 --> 02:29:15.800]  Yeah, I don't.
[02:29:15.800 --> 02:29:19.600]  Well, I got like my basement is very, it's like, you know
[02:29:19.600 --> 02:29:22.600]  people have a wine cellar and it's like perfect temperature.
[02:29:22.600 --> 02:29:23.440]  Perfect.
[02:29:24.560 --> 02:29:26.960]  I won't even say my basement is perfect.
[02:29:26.960 --> 02:29:29.080]  And I don't always hit 60, 60.
[02:29:29.080 --> 02:29:31.640]  Like it can get kind of cold there sometime
[02:29:31.640 --> 02:29:36.200]  but I think the, I've always just stuck with low and slow.
[02:29:36.200 --> 02:29:39.200]  So if it is colder or if it's warmer
[02:29:39.200 --> 02:29:41.640]  then I try to, you know, just balance it
[02:29:41.640 --> 02:29:43.760]  out to where plants aren't drying too fast.
[02:29:43.760 --> 02:29:45.040]  And it's kind of a feel thing.
[02:29:45.080 --> 02:29:47.160]  Like, you know, you know, you check them today.
[02:29:47.160 --> 02:29:48.720]  How are they?
[02:29:48.720 --> 02:29:49.840]  Check them tomorrow.
[02:29:49.840 --> 02:29:52.040]  It's just kind of a gradual feel for me.
[02:29:52.040 --> 02:29:56.160]  Yeah. And even in the same drying room or environment
[02:29:56.160 --> 02:29:58.920]  you know, the time of year makes
[02:29:58.920 --> 02:30:00.880]  makes my procedure very little different.
[02:30:00.880 --> 02:30:03.080]  So like you said, yeah, just, you know, keep an eye on them.
[02:30:03.080 --> 02:30:06.160]  And again, my goal is to do it slow
[02:30:06.160 --> 02:30:09.760]  as slow as I can without getting them molded, you know.
[02:30:09.760 --> 02:30:10.600]  Correct.
[02:30:10.600 --> 02:30:13.080]  Yeah. Like if my, when, when my basement's just hitting
[02:30:13.160 --> 02:30:15.600]  and humming on the right temperature, there's no
[02:30:15.600 --> 02:30:18.880]  I'll leave plants hanging for months, you know,
[02:30:19.880 --> 02:30:21.080]  until I use them.
[02:30:21.080 --> 02:30:23.920]  It's not, it's just like being in a jar, you know
[02:30:23.920 --> 02:30:25.880]  if you have your temperature and humidity right
[02:30:25.880 --> 02:30:27.400]  it's no different.
[02:30:27.400 --> 02:30:31.960]  So that's, you know, look at your room as your jar, you know
[02:30:31.960 --> 02:30:35.200]  And I recently played around with that.
[02:30:35.200 --> 02:30:36.960]  I'm going to say it was an experiment
[02:30:36.960 --> 02:30:39.480]  and not just poor time management, but yeah
[02:30:39.480 --> 02:30:42.800]  the conditions in the drying area were ideal.
[02:30:43.520 --> 02:30:46.200]  They were pretty much 60, 60 for over a month.
[02:30:46.200 --> 02:30:47.440]  And I just kind of left it there.
[02:30:47.440 --> 02:30:49.120]  I'm like, what in my head, I'm like, well
[02:30:49.120 --> 02:30:50.800]  what is the difference really?
[02:30:50.800 --> 02:30:51.640]  Right.
[02:30:51.640 --> 02:30:52.600]  Same condition.
[02:30:52.600 --> 02:30:54.680]  And I don't have the time and I can put it off.
[02:30:54.680 --> 02:30:56.280]  And I did.
[02:30:56.280 --> 02:30:57.640]  Now it's worked out.
[02:30:57.640 --> 02:30:59.120]  Yep. It worked out.
[02:30:59.120 --> 02:31:01.960]  But you know, we, we try different things as far
[02:31:01.960 --> 02:31:05.480]  as methods in our soil to get better terpene profiles.
[02:31:05.480 --> 02:31:09.760]  We try different stresses to get better terpene profiles.
[02:31:09.760 --> 02:31:11.840]  Don't stop experimenting when it comes
[02:31:11.880 --> 02:31:13.480]  to the drying and the curing, you know
[02:31:13.480 --> 02:31:14.320]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:31:14.320 --> 02:31:16.760]  You can mix them up a little bit earlier than the rest
[02:31:16.760 --> 02:31:18.720]  or maybe let it hang a little bit longer.
[02:31:18.720 --> 02:31:19.800]  Right.
[02:31:19.800 --> 02:31:22.600]  Try, try to, you know, find your sweet spot
[02:31:22.600 --> 02:31:25.520]  and experimentation is the only way to get there.
[02:31:25.520 --> 02:31:27.120]  Exactly. Win some, lose some.
[02:31:27.120 --> 02:31:28.200]  Yeah. And it's funny, man.
[02:31:28.200 --> 02:31:31.200]  I've had like, you know, a plant where it was like, you know
[02:31:31.200 --> 02:31:33.720]  kind of crispy, feeling really dry.
[02:31:33.720 --> 02:31:36.840]  And then I've taken that in a brown, you know
[02:31:36.840 --> 02:31:40.360]  in a bag over to my workshop and then had it stored in there.
[02:31:40.360 --> 02:31:42.480]  And then now the conditions are totally different.
[02:31:42.480 --> 02:31:43.480]  It was way more humid.
[02:31:43.480 --> 02:31:45.000]  And the next day is like back
[02:31:45.000 --> 02:31:47.880]  to that kind of soft marshmallow feel like that quick.
[02:31:48.960 --> 02:31:50.320]  And I feel like that's fine.
[02:31:50.320 --> 02:31:53.600]  It's okay to go from that dry to moist to me.
[02:31:53.600 --> 02:31:56.840]  I don't think that's a big, going to be a big degradation
[02:31:56.840 --> 02:31:58.560]  as long as the temperatures are not high
[02:31:58.560 --> 02:32:01.680]  and you're keeping it, you know, in that zone.
[02:32:01.680 --> 02:32:03.280]  A lot of, a lot of room to play.
[02:32:03.280 --> 02:32:04.120]  There is.
[02:32:04.120 --> 02:32:07.800]  And I just smile because yeah, Chad famous for being muted.
[02:32:08.800 --> 02:32:10.600]  This is a true story.
[02:32:10.600 --> 02:32:13.960]  True story, true story, man.
[02:32:15.080 --> 02:32:15.920]  Let's see here.
[02:32:15.920 --> 02:32:18.000]  We got Brian back in the house as well.
[02:32:18.000 --> 02:32:18.840]  Popping in.
[02:32:18.840 --> 02:32:20.080]  Thank you, sir.
[02:32:20.080 --> 02:32:21.120]  What else we got here?
[02:32:21.120 --> 02:32:23.040]  Japanese knotweed.
[02:32:23.040 --> 02:32:24.040]  Yeah. I've heard, man.
[02:32:24.040 --> 02:32:27.000]  I've been wanting to get my hands on some Japanese knotweed.
[02:32:27.000 --> 02:32:29.800]  That's a very great medicinal plant.
[02:32:30.680 --> 02:32:33.480]  I've been looking at trying to secure some, grow it here.
[02:32:34.560 --> 02:32:36.120]  I don't know, you know, a lot about it.
[02:32:36.160 --> 02:32:40.080]  I think that's just a good plant to grow, make inputs.
[02:32:41.840 --> 02:32:44.440]  Yeah. I'm sure again, like you were saying earlier,
[02:32:44.440 --> 02:32:47.040]  you know, no one is an overall master
[02:32:47.960 --> 02:32:50.400]  because we're still finding cool things like this.
[02:32:50.400 --> 02:32:52.640]  Cool sources of like, well, hey,
[02:32:52.640 --> 02:32:55.280]  if we ferment that plant or do this with the plant,
[02:32:55.280 --> 02:32:57.240]  it gives me exactly what I need.
[02:32:57.240 --> 02:32:58.440]  Yeah, really, man.
[02:33:01.400 --> 02:33:03.480]  As I'm scrolling past the Monsanto
[02:33:03.480 --> 02:33:05.480]  and bear comments and chat, I wonder,
[02:33:05.760 --> 02:33:08.160]  I don't know what portion of our conversation
[02:33:08.160 --> 02:33:09.560]  brought that up, but.
[02:33:11.400 --> 02:33:12.240]  Yeah.
[02:33:13.120 --> 02:33:14.280]  Boo, boo on them.
[02:33:15.120 --> 02:33:16.880]  It looks like, yeah, I'm looking through here.
[02:33:16.880 --> 02:33:18.000]  I don't see a lot of questions.
[02:33:18.000 --> 02:33:23.000]  Yeah. One guy says shredder 90911, quality shredder here.
[02:33:23.320 --> 02:33:27.720]  So yeah, you want quality on your shredders.
[02:33:27.720 --> 02:33:28.560]  Yeah.
[02:33:28.560 --> 02:33:30.720]  Yeah, you need quality in all your inputs.
[02:33:30.720 --> 02:33:32.520]  You don't want to cheap out on anything,
[02:33:32.520 --> 02:33:34.240]  especially if you're thinking long-term.
[02:33:34.280 --> 02:33:37.000]  I mean, what's spending an extra maybe,
[02:33:37.000 --> 02:33:39.280]  even if it's like a couple of hundred bucks,
[02:33:39.280 --> 02:33:40.800]  if you know that it's going to be quality
[02:33:40.800 --> 02:33:42.000]  and it's going to last.
[02:33:44.240 --> 02:33:47.680]  Yeah, everybody's giving you props in chat, Brian,
[02:33:47.680 --> 02:33:51.000]  for being the trooper and being a soldier.
[02:33:52.480 --> 02:33:54.800]  My wife gave me some elderberry syrup
[02:33:54.800 --> 02:33:56.760]  and that did not go down well, man.
[02:33:57.680 --> 02:33:59.960]  No, well, we can, you know,
[02:33:59.960 --> 02:34:02.320]  we've gotten a lot of questions today.
[02:34:02.320 --> 02:34:04.280]  We've hit a lot of questions.
[02:34:04.280 --> 02:34:05.640]  So I think, you know, we might be good.
[02:34:05.640 --> 02:34:06.920]  I'm sure there's still some in chat.
[02:34:06.920 --> 02:34:09.160]  I honestly, I've never made it to the bottom
[02:34:09.160 --> 02:34:10.360]  this whole time.
[02:34:10.360 --> 02:34:12.720]  So I'm trying to keep track of the questions.
[02:34:12.720 --> 02:34:14.600]  Well, how about, let's put it to the audience.
[02:34:14.600 --> 02:34:16.360]  Would you guys like us to do this again?
[02:34:16.360 --> 02:34:19.040]  Now that you guys know, maybe think of some questions
[02:34:19.040 --> 02:34:20.360]  and we can do this again.
[02:34:20.360 --> 02:34:23.920]  And obviously Marco, Chad and I like this kind of thing
[02:34:23.920 --> 02:34:25.160]  because it's off the cuff.
[02:34:25.160 --> 02:34:27.240]  You guys are firing questions at us.
[02:34:27.240 --> 02:34:28.440]  Hopefully we know the answer.
[02:34:28.440 --> 02:34:30.000]  And if not, we're not going to bullshit you
[02:34:30.000 --> 02:34:32.040]  and tell you something that we don't know.
[02:34:33.000 --> 02:34:34.960]  Yeah, I appreciate the comments have been positive too.
[02:34:34.960 --> 02:34:36.480]  Y'all ain't all here talking shit
[02:34:36.480 --> 02:34:37.560]  because I'm looking today.
[02:34:37.560 --> 02:34:41.200]  Usually I don't look, but yeah, I appreciate that, man.
[02:34:41.200 --> 02:34:43.120]  We're here trying to give y'all a little something, man.
[02:34:43.120 --> 02:34:44.480]  I appreciate y'all.
[02:34:44.480 --> 02:34:48.440]  Not, you know, with no assholes in the group today.
[02:34:48.440 --> 02:34:49.280]  It looks good.
[02:34:50.160 --> 02:34:52.440]  Yeah, people, you know, people are here to learn.
[02:34:52.440 --> 02:34:55.120]  There's nobody holding a gun to people's heads
[02:34:55.120 --> 02:34:56.720]  saying that you have to be here.
[02:34:58.000 --> 02:35:00.120]  And again, the quality of the information
[02:35:00.160 --> 02:35:03.840]  that you guys are giving and the experience, you know.
[02:35:03.840 --> 02:35:06.880]  Thanks, Zach, much love because it's, yeah,
[02:35:06.880 --> 02:35:08.440]  it's exactly what we need.
[02:35:08.440 --> 02:35:12.120]  Oh, I see, I see Peter coming in here though.
[02:35:12.120 --> 02:35:13.960]  Coming in hot from Chris.
[02:35:13.960 --> 02:35:18.280]  What other than comfrey should I grow for natural inputs?
[02:35:18.280 --> 02:35:20.720]  And isn't comfrey kind of been poo-pooed lately
[02:35:20.720 --> 02:35:25.360]  as a like a insect detractor or something?
[02:35:25.360 --> 02:35:27.840]  I thought for some reason comfrey was the rage
[02:35:27.840 --> 02:35:29.040]  and then some.
[02:35:29.080 --> 02:35:32.120]  Well, I've heard that it has to be that balking comfrey.
[02:35:32.120 --> 02:35:33.680]  Otherwise, yeah, it's bullshit.
[02:35:33.680 --> 02:35:36.800]  So it's a very specific comfrey.
[02:35:36.800 --> 02:35:37.640]  Okay.
[02:35:37.640 --> 02:35:41.680]  Standard comfrey or true comfrey spreads by seed too.
[02:35:41.680 --> 02:35:44.120]  And it gets all over the place.
[02:35:44.120 --> 02:35:46.440]  If that's what you have, use it, chop it up, use it.
[02:35:46.440 --> 02:35:49.400]  But the comfrey you use is Bakken 14, man.
[02:35:49.400 --> 02:35:51.680]  That was one developed over there in Russia.
[02:35:51.680 --> 02:35:53.160]  It doesn't spread by seed.
[02:35:53.160 --> 02:35:54.840]  The seeds are sterile.
[02:35:54.840 --> 02:35:58.200]  It just forms big ass roots and clumps.
[02:35:58.200 --> 02:35:59.600]  Doesn't get out of pocket.
[02:35:59.600 --> 02:36:03.520]  I would also grow stinging nettle.
[02:36:03.520 --> 02:36:06.280]  Literally a stinging nettle plant this big.
[02:36:06.280 --> 02:36:08.280]  And I've had it in this room
[02:36:08.280 --> 02:36:10.440]  would be you couldn't see anything but that plant.
[02:36:10.440 --> 02:36:13.440]  Like that's how big stinging nettle can get.
[02:36:13.440 --> 02:36:14.640]  That's a great one.
[02:36:14.640 --> 02:36:16.880]  I like sunflowers.
[02:36:16.880 --> 02:36:19.040]  Sunflowers are beautiful.
[02:36:19.040 --> 02:36:23.240]  At the end of the year, chop them down, use the stalks.
[02:36:23.240 --> 02:36:27.840]  Make your WSC input.
[02:36:28.200 --> 02:36:29.320]  Potassium, sorry.
[02:36:32.240 --> 02:36:36.040]  Artichokes, Jerusalem artichokes or sunchokes.
[02:36:36.040 --> 02:36:38.160]  They're a great root to grow.
[02:36:38.160 --> 02:36:40.000]  You can make a jadam pesticide
[02:36:40.000 --> 02:36:41.880]  just by boiling the roots down.
[02:36:43.360 --> 02:36:45.680]  You know, mullein, if you guys have heard of that.
[02:36:45.680 --> 02:36:49.080]  It's like, some people call it cowboy toilet paper.
[02:36:51.040 --> 02:36:53.640]  Mullein has some very medicinal properties.
[02:36:53.640 --> 02:36:56.080]  You can burn it and it's good for your lungs.
[02:36:56.080 --> 02:36:57.720]  I've rolled it up before.
[02:36:58.160 --> 02:37:00.960]  It's interesting, but I think that's a good plant
[02:37:00.960 --> 02:37:04.600]  to definitely keep around your property.
[02:37:06.440 --> 02:37:07.920]  Dandelions.
[02:37:07.920 --> 02:37:10.240]  Boom, dandelion, there you go.
[02:37:11.480 --> 02:37:14.640]  Sesame, sesame grows in most zones.
[02:37:14.640 --> 02:37:16.360]  Ginger, I grow my own ginger.
[02:37:16.360 --> 02:37:18.080]  For my own, I make my own OHN.
[02:37:18.080 --> 02:37:19.720]  I grow my own ginger.
[02:37:19.720 --> 02:37:22.040]  I grow my own garlic.
[02:37:22.040 --> 02:37:24.640]  I've grown my own angelica.
[02:37:25.080 --> 02:37:27.840]  I can't, well, I looked at a cinnamon something,
[02:37:27.840 --> 02:37:29.640]  but you can't really grow that like I want to.
[02:37:29.640 --> 02:37:31.120]  And then licorice, I've grown licorice.
[02:37:31.120 --> 02:37:34.640]  So you can kind of grow the inputs to make your,
[02:37:34.640 --> 02:37:36.520]  you know, that's what it's all about, guys.
[02:37:36.520 --> 02:37:37.680]  Grow all this stuff.
[02:37:37.680 --> 02:37:38.520]  The regenerative right there.
[02:37:38.520 --> 02:37:41.160]  Exactly, you're growing that stuff.
[02:37:41.160 --> 02:37:42.600]  You don't have to buy it.
[02:37:42.600 --> 02:37:44.680]  That's the real difference between an educator
[02:37:44.680 --> 02:37:47.680]  and somebody who's just trying to hawk and sell you products.
[02:37:47.680 --> 02:37:48.520]  Yep.
[02:37:48.520 --> 02:37:51.520]  Like, you know, just for instance, you know, like,
[02:37:51.520 --> 02:37:53.720]  you know, I discovered, well, not discovered.
[02:37:54.280 --> 02:37:56.320]  Take that off the equation.
[02:37:56.320 --> 02:37:58.320]  Everybody knows Q, Jay Plant speaker.
[02:37:58.320 --> 02:38:00.000]  His product Q is crushing it.
[02:38:00.000 --> 02:38:01.520]  It's a great, awesome product.
[02:38:01.520 --> 02:38:03.240]  I know a lot of people are tearing it up over there
[02:38:03.240 --> 02:38:05.480]  on the field of soil and I love it.
[02:38:05.480 --> 02:38:10.000]  But as the natural farmer, I say, I like that product.
[02:38:10.000 --> 02:38:11.920]  Maybe I can't afford that.
[02:38:11.920 --> 02:38:13.840]  Let's go down deeper.
[02:38:13.840 --> 02:38:15.200]  Where does it come from?
[02:38:15.200 --> 02:38:16.840]  Oh, it's a bark.
[02:38:16.840 --> 02:38:20.280]  Oh, it's a bark from a tree grown in Chile predominantly.
[02:38:20.280 --> 02:38:23.680]  Oh, let me go see if I can buy this bark.
[02:38:24.640 --> 02:38:26.360]  You know, for a lower price.
[02:38:26.360 --> 02:38:27.880]  Then you get your hands on that bark
[02:38:27.880 --> 02:38:29.520]  and now you start working with it.
[02:38:29.520 --> 02:38:32.240]  You know, that's how the mind of a natural farmer works.
[02:38:32.240 --> 02:38:35.200]  I love supporting people and supporting good products.
[02:38:35.200 --> 02:38:36.320]  That's good.
[02:38:36.320 --> 02:38:37.720]  Jay's product is great.
[02:38:37.720 --> 02:38:39.800]  No hate on that.
[02:38:39.800 --> 02:38:42.640]  Guys, without the money, seek out the bark.
[02:38:42.640 --> 02:38:44.720]  You can make your own little Q extract
[02:38:44.720 --> 02:38:46.040]  and it works really nice, man.
[02:38:46.040 --> 02:38:47.480]  This stuff was really soapy,
[02:38:47.480 --> 02:38:49.120]  even just dropping it in the water
[02:38:49.120 --> 02:38:50.840]  to start my little oil process.
[02:38:50.840 --> 02:38:52.680]  It was very soapy, so on.
[02:38:52.680 --> 02:38:54.000]  You know, just things like that, guys.
[02:38:54.000 --> 02:38:55.960]  Look for the source if you can.
[02:38:55.960 --> 02:38:58.600]  You know, to me, it's gonna save you in the long run.
[02:39:00.480 --> 02:39:01.320]  Awesome.
[02:39:01.320 --> 02:39:03.280]  And Alex, try him in here.
[02:39:03.280 --> 02:39:04.680]  Local, local, local.
[02:39:04.680 --> 02:39:06.160]  Definitely, he does a lot of this.
[02:39:06.160 --> 02:39:07.360]  Well said, Alex.
[02:39:07.360 --> 02:39:08.600]  Yep.
[02:39:08.600 --> 02:39:10.440]  Always appreciate his input.
[02:39:10.440 --> 02:39:13.880]  And the input from chat is unanimous.
[02:39:13.880 --> 02:39:15.760]  They definitely wanna see another one
[02:39:15.760 --> 02:39:17.560]  of these episodes again.
[02:39:17.560 --> 02:39:20.440]  So I appreciate everybody in chat,
[02:39:21.240 --> 02:39:23.440]  that the questions have kept me busy
[02:39:23.440 --> 02:39:25.040]  and rolling all day long.
[02:39:25.040 --> 02:39:27.640]  So I know these guys could probably go 10 hours.
[02:39:27.640 --> 02:39:29.720]  I know you guys could probably go 10 hours
[02:39:29.720 --> 02:39:31.280]  just going the back and forth,
[02:39:31.280 --> 02:39:34.200]  but we'll get it wrapped up here.
[02:39:34.200 --> 02:39:38.280]  I do just wanna say that tonight, 7 p.m.,
[02:39:38.280 --> 02:39:43.080]  I will be back with Sun Grown Mids on the FCPO2 channel.
[02:39:43.080 --> 02:39:45.200]  We're gonna be talking about patient's rights
[02:39:45.200 --> 02:39:48.800]  and knowing your rights and how it can save your butt.
[02:39:48.840 --> 02:39:51.920]  So please tune into that.
[02:39:51.920 --> 02:39:54.800]  We'll see you there, 7 p.m. on the West Coast.
[02:39:54.800 --> 02:39:57.880]  But I also obviously wanna give the host of the show
[02:39:57.880 --> 02:39:59.640]  your final words.
[02:39:59.640 --> 02:40:03.400]  So Brian and Marco, please go ahead and speak.
[02:40:03.400 --> 02:40:04.960]  Yeah, we appreciate everybody on this.
[02:40:04.960 --> 02:40:07.840]  Like I said, we're trying different show ideas.
[02:40:07.840 --> 02:40:09.720]  Some of them seem like resonated with you.
[02:40:09.720 --> 02:40:10.560]  Some of them didn't.
[02:40:10.560 --> 02:40:12.800]  So we're just gonna keep trying to bring certain things
[02:40:12.800 --> 02:40:15.040]  to you and dial it in for 2022.
[02:40:15.960 --> 02:40:18.760]  Tomorrow, we have a special episode with Leighton
[02:40:19.320 --> 02:40:20.560]  for you guys that don't know.
[02:40:20.560 --> 02:40:24.800]  Unfortunately, his girlfriend passed away.
[02:40:24.800 --> 02:40:27.840]  And I know from working with Leighton this past year
[02:40:27.840 --> 02:40:30.440]  that that was his rock.
[02:40:30.440 --> 02:40:33.240]  I think Marco, myself, Chad,
[02:40:33.240 --> 02:40:35.080]  we all have significant others.
[02:40:35.080 --> 02:40:37.320]  I can only imagine if I didn't have my wife
[02:40:37.320 --> 02:40:39.040]  or you guys didn't have your wives,
[02:40:39.040 --> 02:40:42.280]  where we would be in life and just how sad
[02:40:42.280 --> 02:40:43.600]  and how heavy of a burden that is.
[02:40:43.600 --> 02:40:45.960]  So we're gonna celebrate her life tomorrow.
[02:40:45.960 --> 02:40:49.760]  We're gonna be talking with Dr. Greg.
[02:40:49.760 --> 02:40:52.320]  We're gonna be talking with Kevin Jodry.
[02:40:52.320 --> 02:40:53.920]  And we're gonna be talking with Shango Lose
[02:40:53.920 --> 02:40:57.080]  about just medical cannabis in general.
[02:40:57.080 --> 02:40:58.200]  So again, if you guys,
[02:40:58.200 --> 02:40:59.480]  I know I've been saying this probably
[02:40:59.480 --> 02:41:02.880]  like the last three weeks, but just reach out to Leighton.
[02:41:02.880 --> 02:41:04.780]  It's gotta be really tough to lose somebody
[02:41:04.780 --> 02:41:08.440]  right as the holidays come in and just sad to see.
[02:41:08.440 --> 02:41:11.520]  So we're gonna celebrate life tomorrow.
[02:41:11.520 --> 02:41:13.560]  And I'm just excited to be able to chop it up
[02:41:13.560 --> 02:41:15.560]  with those guys and talk about medicine.
[02:41:16.320 --> 02:41:17.160]  Yeah, man.
[02:41:17.160 --> 02:41:18.000]  Leighton has a G.
[02:41:18.000 --> 02:41:18.960]  Yeah, Leighton, man.
[02:41:18.960 --> 02:41:19.800]  Much love for Leighton, man.
[02:41:19.800 --> 02:41:22.120]  That's another dude that does it from the heart.
[02:41:22.120 --> 02:41:24.040]  He doesn't get paid for any of this shit either.
[02:41:24.040 --> 02:41:25.000]  So.
[02:41:25.000 --> 02:41:25.840]  No, he doesn't.
[02:41:25.840 --> 02:41:27.000]  So reach out to that man.
[02:41:27.000 --> 02:41:29.120]  Like y'all know what the man went through something
[02:41:29.120 --> 02:41:29.960]  and just hit him up.
[02:41:29.960 --> 02:41:31.680]  Hey man, we're thinking about you, brother.
[02:41:31.680 --> 02:41:33.040]  I told him the other day, I was like,
[02:41:33.040 --> 02:41:34.880]  hey man, the community needs you, bro.
[02:41:34.880 --> 02:41:37.560]  So, you know, that means shit to us.
[02:41:37.560 --> 02:41:40.320]  Like, you know, like everybody that does this
[02:41:40.320 --> 02:41:45.080]  and shares and gives, man, they want that support, man.
[02:41:45.080 --> 02:41:47.360]  That's what helps us, drives us, you know what I mean?
[02:41:47.360 --> 02:41:50.160]  And just keep thinking about Leighton, man.
[02:41:50.160 --> 02:41:53.280]  And man, losing his wife, that's terrible.
[02:41:54.240 --> 02:41:56.440]  Looking forward to 2022.
[02:41:57.280 --> 02:42:01.480]  Let's keep, you know, let's rally behind him as a community.
[02:42:01.480 --> 02:42:04.560]  You know, support him, support the show tomorrow.
[02:42:04.560 --> 02:42:06.720]  That'll mean a lot, seeing all those viewers,
[02:42:06.720 --> 02:42:08.960]  just checking it out, knowing that's a show to, you know,
[02:42:08.960 --> 02:42:12.280]  to support and memorize his loved one, man.
[02:42:12.280 --> 02:42:14.440]  So that's all, that's what, you know,
[02:42:14.440 --> 02:42:16.080]  this community is all about, man.
[02:42:16.080 --> 02:42:18.720]  Supporting each other, helping each other.
[02:42:18.720 --> 02:42:23.720]  Let's keep it positive and keep it positive with me, man.
[02:42:23.920 --> 02:42:27.120]  I'm gonna keep it positive with you and we'll be 100.
[02:42:29.720 --> 02:42:31.120]  Well said, well said.
[02:42:31.120 --> 02:42:35.560]  And yeah, much, much respect and thoughts out to you, Leighton.
[02:42:36.760 --> 02:42:38.600]  You got your family here too, brother.
[02:42:38.600 --> 02:42:40.360]  So we're here, we're here for you
[02:42:40.360 --> 02:42:41.520]  and that'll be nice tomorrow.
[02:42:41.560 --> 02:42:42.680]  So thank you, Brian.
[02:42:43.840 --> 02:42:45.240]  Get that going.
[02:42:45.240 --> 02:42:48.600]  And everybody in chat, thank you for the support
[02:42:48.600 --> 02:42:50.080]  and we hope to see you again.
[02:42:50.080 --> 02:42:53.720]  So with that, we will tune out for the week.
[02:42:53.720 --> 02:42:55.720]  And special hats off to Brian, man.
[02:42:55.720 --> 02:42:57.520]  Bref Favre of SCP right there.
[02:42:57.520 --> 02:42:59.080]  Look at that guy.
[02:42:59.080 --> 02:42:59.920]  Yes, sir.
