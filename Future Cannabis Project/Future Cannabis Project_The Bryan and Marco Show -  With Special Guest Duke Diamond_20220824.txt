[00:00.000 --> 00:05.400]  Hey, good afternoon actually to you Living Soil Nerds.
[00:05.400 --> 00:06.960]  Happy Wednesday.
[00:06.960 --> 00:08.960]  We got another one for the books.
[00:08.960 --> 00:12.600]  Lucky enough to have several people on board today.
[00:12.600 --> 00:16.040]  As always, we got Mr. Ken behind the scenes working the IT stuff.
[00:16.040 --> 00:20.080]  So appreciate you, sir, making this look good each and every week.
[00:20.080 --> 00:22.200]  Our guest obviously today is Duke Diamond.
[00:22.200 --> 00:28.360]  I don't think our audience knows or isn't aware of the respect that I have for this
[00:28.360 --> 00:29.360]  gentleman.
[00:29.360 --> 00:31.600]  He's always been telling the truth.
[00:31.600 --> 00:32.920]  I think I've said this many times.
[00:32.920 --> 00:37.040]  He was the first one to kind of show me that, hey man, even if you do make it in this game,
[00:37.040 --> 00:39.040]  you might not even enjoy it.
[00:39.040 --> 00:41.020]  That turned out to be true.
[00:41.020 --> 00:46.480]  So there's a lot of things that I think Duke's given the industry a lot of wisdom.
[00:46.480 --> 00:50.000]  We were fortunate enough to have an event with him where he kind of just broke down
[00:50.000 --> 00:51.000]  a lot of stuff.
[00:51.000 --> 00:53.960]  And I think a lot of people were able to go down rabbit holes with that.
[00:53.960 --> 00:57.920]  I also got the homie Ryan in the building today.
[00:57.920 --> 01:00.000]  We're going to be smoking on some Homestead stuff.
[01:00.000 --> 01:01.840]  So shout out to TJ.
[01:01.840 --> 01:03.320]  Your stuff is fantastic, brother.
[01:03.320 --> 01:07.880]  We've been hitting it here for probably a good 10 minutes or so.
[01:07.880 --> 01:11.040]  That's why I'm probably struggling for words because this shit's really kicking in.
[01:11.040 --> 01:15.200]  But this shit smells fantastic, TJ.
[01:15.200 --> 01:19.120]  The homie came with the, we used to always call these the baller jars.
[01:19.120 --> 01:24.320]  Duke, I don't know if these are considered baller jars anymore, but back in the day they
[01:24.320 --> 01:25.320]  were.
[01:25.320 --> 01:26.800]  These were like the sought after thing.
[01:26.800 --> 01:30.120]  So Mr. Ryan, appreciate you coming through.
[01:30.120 --> 01:32.240]  And then we're going to kind of just chop it up with Duke.
[01:32.240 --> 01:36.880]  There's a lot of things that you've been working on, sir, since they let you come back out
[01:36.880 --> 01:38.960]  and play with the community.
[01:38.960 --> 01:42.320]  So I kind of wanted to let you talk about some things.
[01:42.320 --> 01:46.560]  I'm going to give the mic to Marco because I know that the community just kind of respects
[01:46.560 --> 01:49.560]  you Duke in a variety of ways, man.
[01:49.560 --> 01:54.240]  And I'll always be a cheerleader for that, buddy, because you always are who you say
[01:54.240 --> 01:55.240]  you are, man.
[01:55.240 --> 01:56.240]  I don't think I've ever seen anything different.
[01:56.240 --> 01:57.240]  I'm consistent.
[01:57.240 --> 01:58.240]  At least I'm consistent.
[01:58.240 --> 01:59.240]  Yes, sir.
[01:59.240 --> 02:00.240]  Consistent.
[02:00.240 --> 02:01.240]  I've heard that plenty of times.
[02:01.240 --> 02:02.240]  Yeah.
[02:02.240 --> 02:03.240]  Good to see you again, Duke.
[02:03.240 --> 02:04.240]  Pretty much, man.
[02:04.240 --> 02:11.240]  Just want to go through and kind of talk about what you've been up to since the last time
[02:11.240 --> 02:12.240]  we talked.
[02:12.240 --> 02:17.080]  You were a little bit fresh out back then, and now things have changed.
[02:17.080 --> 02:21.400]  I see kind of getting your roots back planted and getting things spread out and getting
[02:21.400 --> 02:23.120]  your hands into some more shit, man.
[02:23.120 --> 02:25.280]  So very, very glad to see that.
[02:25.280 --> 02:29.800]  And we all knew that was just going to happen naturally, you know, as it should.
[02:29.800 --> 02:34.600]  A couple of things people are going to want to know, like about drops and you coming back
[02:34.600 --> 02:36.400]  to VA or what you got going on.
[02:36.400 --> 02:40.640]  So yeah, I mean, I'll just give it over to you and kind of let the folks know what you
[02:40.640 --> 02:41.640]  want them to know.
[02:41.640 --> 02:42.640]  Yeah, man.
[02:42.640 --> 02:43.640]  Well, you know how it is.
[02:43.640 --> 02:44.640]  What do you say?
[02:44.640 --> 02:50.040]  Duke Diamond does what Duke Diamond does because Duke Diamond is Duke Diamond.
[02:51.040 --> 02:53.640]  What's understood doesn't need to be explained.
[02:53.640 --> 02:59.080]  So we'll go into gardening.
[02:59.080 --> 03:06.200]  So doing that's always good times.
[03:06.200 --> 03:12.520]  New stuff, you know, working on all that, you know, but things take time.
[03:12.520 --> 03:19.400]  You know, anything worth doing right, you know, it's going to take some time.
[03:19.760 --> 03:28.280]  So I had something that I've been working out with my buddy Drew and that finally is
[03:28.280 --> 03:30.040]  coming to fruition.
[03:30.040 --> 03:37.560]  So but it's just like a real, real limited, like a real limited thing coming up in like
[03:37.560 --> 03:38.560]  a week.
[03:38.560 --> 03:41.440]  So it ain't nothing, ain't nothing big like talking about.
[03:41.440 --> 03:47.120]  Do a little something else in November, but it'll be after New Year's.
[03:47.120 --> 03:51.600]  So I'm working on this one, everything I really hit it.
[03:51.600 --> 03:54.280]  Shirts, hoodies, things like that.
[03:54.280 --> 03:59.680]  That's getting ready to be happening here in about 10 days.
[03:59.680 --> 04:02.320]  So that's cool.
[04:02.320 --> 04:04.960]  Running through the soil.
[04:04.960 --> 04:07.800]  Got Jeremy, he's the man.
[04:07.800 --> 04:14.760]  He made my soil blend up for me so I could save my back and not have to, you know, do
[04:14.760 --> 04:16.420]  it the old fashioned way.
[04:16.420 --> 04:21.980]  So I'm running, running through that, making sure everything's all cool.
[04:21.980 --> 04:24.620]  Document the runs and everything.
[04:24.620 --> 04:30.260]  And you know, as long as everything's all good, he'll be able to offer that to people,
[04:30.260 --> 04:34.500]  which that's going to be super cool.
[04:34.500 --> 04:39.420]  And other than that, you know, you know, do the little discord thing on Friday nights.
[04:39.420 --> 04:43.380]  You know, I'm always checking the messages, but you know, we do a little seed giveaway
[04:43.380 --> 04:44.940]  thing on Friday nights.
[04:45.660 --> 04:49.780]  Anytime I got a buddy that wants to kind of kick it and shoot the shit, you know, I got
[04:49.780 --> 04:57.020]  the little thing here, you know, I can record it, put it on, put it on YouTube.
[04:57.020 --> 05:01.500]  Last one I did was with my buddy, the mycology collector.
[05:01.500 --> 05:02.500]  He's good.
[05:02.500 --> 05:03.500]  He's good people.
[05:03.500 --> 05:07.820]  It was all about shrooms and shit.
[05:07.820 --> 05:11.220]  So you know, switch up, switch up gears a little bit.
[05:11.220 --> 05:14.900]  Other than that, you know, it's just...
[05:15.860 --> 05:18.540]  You know, same old, same old.
[05:18.540 --> 05:21.380]  Just stay busy all the time.
[05:21.380 --> 05:24.180]  Work and keep it moving and whatnot.
[05:24.180 --> 05:31.460]  And I keep thinking about the last time we talked.
[05:31.460 --> 05:36.300]  We had that interview and you're talking about people like need to get smacked up and I was
[05:36.300 --> 05:39.500]  like, you know, you know, I don't know.
[05:39.500 --> 05:42.980]  I think about that like pretty, pretty constantly, man.
[05:43.060 --> 05:45.060]  Like, what is Marco saying, man?
[05:45.060 --> 05:47.540]  And then I was like, you know what, man?
[05:47.540 --> 05:49.660]  Next time I see you, I'll be like, yeah, you're right, man.
[05:49.660 --> 05:51.860]  Some of these jokers, you get smacked the fuck up.
[05:54.260 --> 05:56.500]  Took a while, you know, it took a while to think on that.
[05:56.500 --> 05:58.700]  Now I got I got an answer for sure.
[05:59.860 --> 06:00.980]  That's what's up, man.
[06:01.700 --> 06:05.540]  Well, that's kind of the problem with this industry is that we treat it more like how
[06:05.540 --> 06:08.420]  comedians do, where like, you know, comedians are stealing jokes.
[06:08.420 --> 06:12.820]  Seemed like nobody was really telling the truth till Rogan came out and called out Mencia.
[06:13.660 --> 06:17.580]  The behind the scenes curtain aspects of the cannabis industry is that there's a lot of
[06:17.580 --> 06:22.140]  people that steal each other's work or pretend to do certain things and just, you know,
[06:22.140 --> 06:24.100]  polish it a little bit and call it something else.
[06:24.780 --> 06:27.460]  When a lot of us behind the scenes know exactly what they're doing.
[06:28.180 --> 06:31.580]  And, you know, kudos to you, Duke, because, you know, shit happens to you, buddy.
[06:31.580 --> 06:36.380]  But I would say probably the majority have no idea about it, man, because you just keep it
[06:36.380 --> 06:38.540]  moving. You always educate.
[06:38.540 --> 06:43.020]  And I think that's that's really what people are after, dude, is that you, you know, I
[06:43.020 --> 06:47.980]  always say you really carry the torch for more of like the living soil crowd as well as
[06:47.980 --> 06:51.100]  the character that should be, you know, that that torch as well.
[06:51.820 --> 06:55.380]  So I kind of wanted to get into into those seeds.
[06:55.380 --> 07:01.020]  And if you feel like you want to express anything today, man, the platform's here.
[07:01.020 --> 07:04.460]  Otherwise, you know, I'll just kind of let you guide that part of the conversation.
[07:04.980 --> 07:06.460]  And then, of course, I got a bunch of questions.
[07:06.460 --> 07:09.100]  We'll get into some shit. Oh, well, sure.
[07:10.100 --> 07:13.500]  So the two things that are coming up, one's called the head game.
[07:13.860 --> 07:17.060]  So a little background on the two things.
[07:17.060 --> 07:24.860]  They both they both share the same male before I had gone away like well, actually, I
[07:24.860 --> 07:26.180]  was like the year prior.
[07:26.940 --> 07:30.900]  I had some boys back back east that needed some shit for outdoor.
[07:31.300 --> 07:36.940]  So I was taking an eagle male and just hitting hitting a few other few other things.
[07:37.220 --> 07:39.740]  And one of the things was the free bird.
[07:39.740 --> 07:44.740]  They really they were really digging that, which was excuse me, which was a headband
[07:45.700 --> 07:46.740]  and screaming eagle.
[07:46.980 --> 07:49.340]  So it was like a double dose of screaming eagle on it.
[07:49.700 --> 07:52.380]  Put them up with that and a few other things.
[07:52.860 --> 07:55.300]  They really they were really digging it back home.
[07:55.620 --> 08:03.940]  So I give my body drew a jar of some of the bud and I was like, yeah, some like some of
[08:03.940 --> 08:07.660]  the bud in there, like the lower is, you know, seated, but the colors are good to go.
[08:07.660 --> 08:14.020]  You can blaze it. And I literally had hooked him up with that in the parking lot when I
[08:14.020 --> 08:17.620]  was like getting ready to head out because, you know, the man was after me and shit.
[08:17.900 --> 08:21.700]  So I'll pass him off those and grow them out.
[08:21.740 --> 08:24.980]  He's like, my God, that was fucking awesome shit.
[08:25.220 --> 08:29.420]  So he grows up the seed and everything is like, man, this is the truth.
[08:29.620 --> 08:34.700]  You know, when I want to do something with it, I was like, yeah, do you think, man?
[08:35.500 --> 08:37.980]  So he played around with a little bit.
[08:38.100 --> 08:47.100]  One of the things was Virginia Beach, Afghani really like set tiny, tiny little sour
[08:47.100 --> 08:49.180]  apple buried in that pine.
[08:49.180 --> 08:50.620]  Like it's just killer shit.
[08:50.620 --> 08:52.140]  Real narcotic weed.
[08:52.660 --> 08:56.100]  He had hit that and he also hit the Kimbee.
[08:56.540 --> 09:01.540]  So those were the two offerings now on the on the head.
[09:01.540 --> 09:03.700]  Again, like they stack up.
[09:03.700 --> 09:09.460]  It's like Virginia Beach, Afghani, but like it stacks up like even harder and some more
[09:09.460 --> 09:15.460]  resin to it and everything still got that same same type of, you know, put your back
[09:15.460 --> 09:19.900]  tight punch. The Kimbee hybrid, they call that the delusion.
[09:20.100 --> 09:28.540]  That's the same way, but definitely leans more like the the Kim Kim tennis ball rubber
[09:28.740 --> 09:35.740]  and just that that nasty kind of funk on the on the smell.
[09:36.100 --> 09:42.540]  And, you know, allegedly, you know, it coats the mouth when you smoke it and has a good
[09:42.540 --> 09:44.220]  solid put you back effect to.
[09:45.220 --> 09:47.460]  Hmm. I do.
[09:47.500 --> 09:52.460]  So since you mentioned that Virginia Beach, Ghani, you know, that's been a classic around
[09:52.460 --> 09:53.700]  these parts, you know what I mean?
[09:53.860 --> 09:56.260]  When I was in college, I had a roommate from there.
[09:57.020 --> 10:00.820]  What do you know? Like what are the kind of the origins of that strain, man?
[10:00.820 --> 10:02.820]  Because that's you know, that's like a serious strain.
[10:02.820 --> 10:06.900]  And it's also one that, you know, probably a lot of folks try to copy, you know, I mean,
[10:06.900 --> 10:09.260]  and relabel and try to kind of create.
[10:09.820 --> 10:17.460]  Yeah, so like, you know, you always hear all types of, you know, weird shit, tall tales,
[10:17.460 --> 10:23.260]  like you saw people, the weirdest one I heard was about a sailor, a sailor and a midget.
[10:25.580 --> 10:26.420]  I don't know.
[10:27.220 --> 10:29.100]  I did hear the one about the sailor.
[10:29.140 --> 10:32.780]  Yeah. Some of us sailor and a midget.
[10:33.700 --> 10:43.100]  But my boy, my boy Rob, the one that he passed away a little while back, he knew Harley and
[10:43.100 --> 10:47.780]  all them cats at the beach and, you know, was part of that part of that crew.
[10:48.220 --> 10:54.420]  And they said, you know, he always told me the same thing is that a cat brought it out
[10:54.540 --> 10:55.820]  from Kentucky.
[10:56.460 --> 11:00.180]  And then I'd also heard it from like two other people outside that crew.
[11:00.180 --> 11:07.260]  So to my knowledge, dudes from Kentucky brought it out during the 80s and then been
[11:07.260 --> 11:08.420]  chilling there ever since.
[11:08.780 --> 11:15.220]  Because it was great back in the day, like, you know, under just HPS lights, you know,
[11:15.220 --> 11:20.820]  you'd be able to hit that three light shit and just some ebb and flow trades like it was,
[11:20.900 --> 11:24.140]  you know, the yield on it, the smell on it, the potency.
[11:25.580 --> 11:29.540]  It just it just hit, you know, and you just checked every box.
[11:29.540 --> 11:34.420]  So it was just like a go to for everybody back home, especially like not just for the
[11:34.420 --> 11:37.020]  head, but, you know, make a little money to.
[11:37.700 --> 11:38.620]  Exactly.
[11:40.940 --> 11:41.900]  All right, well, that's cool.
[11:41.940 --> 11:46.740]  Probably the craziest story I heard was something along the lines of a sailor or because,
[11:46.740 --> 11:48.460]  you know, the Navy base is there.
[11:48.460 --> 11:49.380]  So it's always something.
[11:50.060 --> 11:54.860]  So a sailor brought a seed back from over Afghanistan or some crazy shit.
[11:54.900 --> 11:57.180]  So I'm glad you explain that a little better.
[11:57.340 --> 12:00.540]  That's kind of cool that it's from actually, you know, Kentucky.
[12:00.540 --> 12:01.140]  That's kind of dope.
[12:01.940 --> 12:02.780]  Yeah. Yeah.
[12:02.780 --> 12:08.100]  That was that was the consensus there is like nobody really, really knows like talking
[12:08.100 --> 12:13.820]  about. But, you know, when you when you hear the same shit three times from different,
[12:14.180 --> 12:18.940]  you know, people that are separated, then, you know, it kind of makes more sense than a
[12:18.940 --> 12:25.620]  sailor sailing a ship in Afghanistan in the 80s smuggling seeds back in a midget or
[12:25.660 --> 12:27.540]  something, you know, in a car hole.
[12:27.780 --> 12:32.140]  Bro, can you imagine that was the story for real?
[12:32.460 --> 12:35.820]  Are you all just going you're going crazy about that?
[12:36.020 --> 12:39.060]  Yeah, they're really they're hiding seeds in their buttholes.
[12:39.420 --> 12:41.060]  That was probably a little bit much.
[12:41.060 --> 12:46.620]  But OK, I might be adding a little bit more on that one.
[12:46.620 --> 12:48.420]  But it was crazy shit like that.
[12:48.940 --> 12:50.500]  Yeah, it really was, man.
[12:50.940 --> 12:53.100]  You hear all types of crazy shit.
[12:56.620 --> 13:01.060]  So like, where do you think like back in the day, I mean, it did seem like a lot of the
[13:01.060 --> 13:05.820]  genetics were coming, or at least from the East Coast were coming from Florida,
[13:05.820 --> 13:10.100]  Kentucky. I remember some stuff were coming in the Carolinas if you if you knew certain
[13:10.100 --> 13:15.340]  people. And, you know, it always kind of baffled me where that stuff was coming from.
[13:15.340 --> 13:19.100]  And it did seem like, yeah, then the good stuff would then get to New York and Miami.
[13:19.820 --> 13:22.460]  And then, of course, everybody's getting paid if they were able to get it there.
[13:22.980 --> 13:23.980]  Oh, yeah.
[13:23.980 --> 13:28.420]  Yeah. Every every region had it had its own thing, you know, as for damn sure.
[13:30.500 --> 13:36.620]  And being like you got Interstate 95 right there, you know, that it's just, you know,
[13:36.620 --> 13:41.100]  Virginia is like, you know, it's like smack dead in the middle, you know what I mean?
[13:41.100 --> 13:44.860]  So, you know, everything was kind of coming up and through it.
[13:45.180 --> 13:47.500]  And then from the beach, we got that on our logo.
[13:47.540 --> 13:50.420]  And then if I straight up, yeah, and any five.
[13:50.420 --> 13:51.420]  Oh, yeah.
[13:51.420 --> 13:52.900]  That's quite the trail.
[13:54.300 --> 13:55.540]  Yeah. I mean, you got.
[13:55.700 --> 13:58.940]  Yeah. And then you got 64 intersects with it right in Richmond, too.
[13:58.940 --> 14:02.820]  It goes all the way to the beach, goes all the way through like Kentucky and all that.
[14:02.820 --> 14:06.620]  So, yeah, you would end up seeing all types of shit, man.
[14:06.980 --> 14:07.980]  All types of shit.
[14:10.060 --> 14:12.020]  Where do you think the genetics really were coming from?
[14:12.020 --> 14:15.900]  Because a lot of it, or at least from the East Coast, was coming from the East Coast.
[14:15.900 --> 14:23.420]  Because a lot of it, or at least for us, was like we mentioned it before, the Krippi was the one that like the Holy Grail for many, many years.
[14:23.820 --> 14:26.100]  Supposedly that came out of somewhere in Florida.
[14:26.740 --> 14:32.820]  And then there were a bunch of other genetics that were like like here today, gone tomorrow kind of thing that people wish they would have had.
[14:33.180 --> 14:36.940]  Do you think that was just somebody with talent that was pumping that stuff out?
[14:36.940 --> 14:43.020]  Or do you do you think that was you know, there were really multiple people in Florida pumping out those kind of genetics back then?
[14:44.020 --> 14:54.100]  I think anytime you got like really passionate people about their growing and everything and want the best, you know, they were seeking their shit out.
[14:55.060 --> 14:57.780]  You know, seed bank of Holland, right, with Neville.
[14:59.740 --> 15:05.700]  Super Sativa Seed Club was was was doing their thing later on since he comes around.
[15:07.140 --> 15:09.980]  That was that was real huge in the in the 90s.
[15:10.740 --> 15:20.820]  And even before that, like you had what sacred seeds and Brotherhood of Eternal Love, like you had people that were like really, really about their up their shit.
[15:21.420 --> 15:31.020]  And, you know, you also had like import weed, you know, people get seed out of and you just never can tell, you know, they're playing around with something that they were getting.
[15:32.700 --> 15:34.780]  You know, there's that that as well.
[15:35.140 --> 15:49.020]  I think a lot of it was just people really just really going for it, you know, and saying like, yeah, you know, I got a seed catalog and let me let me just go ahead and take the risk and see about getting these seeds.
[15:49.020 --> 15:51.380]  And then they they go and do that.
[15:51.780 --> 16:00.620]  They, you know, either just growing it out in the pure or, you know, they might be messing around and, you know, making their own their own little hybrids of it and shit.
[16:00.900 --> 16:04.100]  So I think I think that was probably a good majority of it.
[16:04.140 --> 16:15.460]  You know. Yeah, I feel like a lot of it was, you know, people ordering some things overseas and then once they got their hands on them, then people were starting to work on a little bit here and that kind of thing.
[16:16.380 --> 16:22.020]  Yeah, it's especially back then, it wasn't like, you know, everybody had access to the genetics.
[16:22.020 --> 16:26.420]  So somebody had some weird ass blueberry something or whatever like that really stood out.
[16:27.180 --> 16:31.260]  Usually everybody knew who that person was or knew a person that knew a person.
[16:31.260 --> 16:35.940]  So it seemed like if you weren't connected in that pipeline, you weren't going to get those genetics.
[16:36.540 --> 16:40.060]  Ryan said that he had something he could throw in on there about the genetics in Florida.
[16:40.060 --> 16:43.780]  So I wanted to let him know it's on the creepy.
[16:44.020 --> 16:48.500]  Just the the Cubans had a lot to do with that in Miami.
[16:49.420 --> 16:51.220]  Growing up in Miami, I saw that a lot.
[16:51.220 --> 16:59.340]  And there is honestly, I feel like a lot of strains came from Miami, like a lot of hazes.
[16:59.860 --> 17:01.940]  People are crazy about that, too, back then.
[17:02.820 --> 17:08.180]  And then a lot of people know about the mango haze or Miami mango and all that.
[17:10.020 --> 17:12.060]  But yeah, I was just the creepy.
[17:12.340 --> 17:14.300]  Whenever I think of creepy, I think of Cubans.
[17:14.500 --> 17:17.980]  I think of Cubans and just trap houses like pushing it.
[17:18.020 --> 17:28.820]  Like, you know, that's a great point, man, because if you think about it for a strain to be known like on the whole East Coast or in the whole region, you know, everybody knows this blueberry.
[17:28.820 --> 17:31.780]  Everybody knows this. It had to be a huge grow.
[17:31.780 --> 17:33.700]  You feel me? Couldn't have just been one grow.
[17:33.700 --> 17:37.980]  It had to be multiple outfits growing that same strain.
[17:37.980 --> 17:41.060]  And, you know, nobody else is more organized than, you know, crime.
[17:41.060 --> 17:44.620]  You know what I'm saying? So that makes it that makes a good point.
[17:45.180 --> 17:47.620]  And people always went out of their way to say creepy with a K.
[17:47.620 --> 17:54.780]  So I don't know if there was ever like some other bullshit genetics out there or something, but they always went out of their way to let me know that.
[17:55.020 --> 17:56.140]  Get this shit with the cake.
[17:58.780 --> 17:59.660]  Possibly, I guess.
[17:59.660 --> 18:01.780]  Yeah, I see.
[18:02.180 --> 18:03.020]  See, walk it.
[18:03.780 --> 18:05.340]  Oh, you got some more.
[18:06.780 --> 18:13.740]  So when we were kind of growing up, it did seem like the New York sour diesel, that kind of stuff was was fire as well.
[18:15.820 --> 18:22.620]  But, you know, it was almost like these like fantasy strains would show that people really wanted would just appear every now and then.
[18:22.620 --> 18:24.460]  And then it seemed like people would unload it.
[18:24.740 --> 18:32.620]  Maybe it would take a week, maybe it would take a month and then you wouldn't see it for a long time again, which I would imagine is because they got to do that whole flip again.
[18:33.260 --> 18:41.100]  But when I was younger, I didn't realize how long it actually really took to to grow, especially at the doing outdoors and that kind of thing.
[18:41.580 --> 18:47.620]  So when when you're kind of moving forward with this back in the day, that's kind of why I wanted to start more with this show.
[18:47.620 --> 18:59.340]  Duke is kind of picking your brain back then because you had an eye for stuff that really smelled to high heaven, you know, and I've spent many nights chopping up with sticky kind of talking about that on.
[18:59.700 --> 19:07.260]  It just seemed like you had, you know, you had something that that other breeders didn't and you were able to find that.
[19:07.260 --> 19:11.180]  And I would love to kind of peer more into how you were able to achieve it.
[19:12.180 --> 19:24.940]  Well, the to me, the smell, because, you know, when I'm looking to make something, I'm looking to check as many of those boxes as possible.
[19:25.420 --> 19:30.620]  But primarily my smell needs to be there and my potency needs to be there.
[19:30.700 --> 19:33.740]  And I feel like they're kind of, you know, tied in.
[19:33.820 --> 19:36.980]  You know, they're kind of, you know, one in the same.
[19:37.460 --> 19:42.460]  I'm not saying there's like nothing potent that doesn't smell, you know, vice versa.
[19:42.460 --> 19:52.740]  But, you know, those are the two two main things, you know, I need smell and effect, you know, like structure and everything else.
[19:53.140 --> 19:55.060]  You know, that's that's right there with it.
[19:55.100 --> 20:03.700]  But, you know, flowering time and I'm not too concerned about, you know, long as it's respectable, you know.
[20:04.220 --> 20:07.420]  But those are the primary things.
[20:07.780 --> 20:13.580]  And then when you're growing out your female populations, like making sure that you're on point there.
[20:14.020 --> 20:25.900]  But when you when you're going into making that that male selection, like, I mean, it's great, you know, if you got like a stinky male point and veg, like, that's cool and all.
[20:26.780 --> 20:34.420]  But, you know, when breeding for smell, like it was very important to, you know, take a couple of clones.
[20:35.260 --> 20:51.260]  And, you know, I'm looking at the male naturally, how he wants to flower out, you know, structurally and all that, you know, floral formations, how fast till I get a bud set, yada yada.
[20:51.620 --> 21:02.620]  But I also like to reverse a male clone, like I'm not growing him up like super huge or anything and just feeding him like I would, you know, any other plant in bloom.
[21:02.900 --> 21:14.620]  And then just kind of kind of get an idea at the end of that cycle what I'm what I'm looking at as far as far as smell that he's looking to pass on.
[21:14.860 --> 21:16.780]  Now, is he going to pass that on?
[21:17.660 --> 21:21.140]  You know, you know, fuck is true breeding for it?
[21:21.140 --> 21:21.980]  Yeah, sure.
[21:22.220 --> 21:26.860]  But, you know, it's to me, it's better than just taking a wild stab in the dark.
[21:27.340 --> 21:36.220]  And typically when I'm doing my male selections, there's a lot of them that would definitely cut the mustard.
[21:36.220 --> 21:48.780]  But then that's kind of like the final distinguishing factor of like, well, you know, this guy was a little more smelly and a little more what I was looking to do.
[21:49.100 --> 21:53.780]  So, you know, that was kind of my process in doing that.
[21:54.260 --> 22:03.140]  And yeah, so he said the female selection, of course, but then, you know, really, really getting a little heavier into the male side of it.
[22:05.410 --> 22:11.250]  And so, I mean, from what I'm hearing, I mean, obviously, male and female matter in any kind of genetic aspect.
[22:11.610 --> 22:25.730]  But what I've learned from you and growing your genetics and like reading some of the stuff that you give to the community, you know, you're the only person I've seen where you say, like, hey, if you if you really push this girl, she's going to she's going to man her out on you.
[22:25.730 --> 22:28.730]  Or, you know, you just mentioned like you're not pushing the males.
[22:28.730 --> 22:32.450]  And that's almost sounds like blasphemy.
[22:32.490 --> 22:40.410]  Like when you were talking like three of light and stuff like there are a lot of people here in Denver that just thought, hey, man, if you're not hitting three of light, like you're not even a farmer.
[22:40.450 --> 22:46.010]  I mean, I guess the aspects of, you know, taste and smell the things that you just talked about your breeding for.
[22:46.330 --> 22:49.090]  That wasn't that wasn't the focal point.
[22:49.090 --> 22:52.890]  But now the community here in Denver realizes that that fad is gone.
[22:52.890 --> 22:59.930]  Like if you're not growing, you know, it's not just about the weight percentage and even the way that was calculated is silly, too.
[23:01.770 --> 23:04.250]  For sure. For sure, man.
[23:04.250 --> 23:07.970]  You definitely want to have the full package.
[23:07.970 --> 23:08.650]  And I mean, like.
[23:09.690 --> 23:17.170]  You know, like what they were doing on like a recreational legal market, like a shit, ain't it ain't new, man.
[23:17.290 --> 23:22.490]  You know, like we've been selling weight for a long fucking time, like way before it was legal.
[23:22.930 --> 23:30.730]  And, you know, if I got pounds of, you know, the stinkiest shit you ever ever smell that tastes great and everything.
[23:31.050 --> 23:39.250]  And then I got, you know, packs of some like some big bud, you know, big bud skunk or some shit like that just ain't quite there.
[23:39.250 --> 23:40.650]  But like it yields. I mean.
[23:41.770 --> 23:49.130]  What the fuck are you going to go by, you know, whether you're smoking it and flipping it or just, you know, as it is, you know.
[23:50.130 --> 23:53.130]  So what about herms, Duke?
[23:53.250 --> 23:56.090]  Because I was just popped a pack of seeds.
[23:56.090 --> 23:58.810]  A guy sent me a free pack and he didn't.
[23:58.810 --> 24:01.770]  He basically said they're stabilized.
[24:01.770 --> 24:04.250]  Femme, you know, they're feminized or stable.
[24:04.250 --> 24:05.410]  Right. So grow them out.
[24:06.090 --> 24:08.530]  Kim D. Cross, I'm not going to call the guy out.
[24:08.530 --> 24:12.410]  He's a small guy and I like this support, you know, all kinds of people.
[24:12.410 --> 24:14.730]  So, you know, he sent me free packs.
[24:14.730 --> 24:15.530]  Ain't no big deal.
[24:15.930 --> 24:27.130]  But it took took my time because like day 24 ish, I started getting, you know, pollen sacks, man, and flower.
[24:27.130 --> 24:31.930]  I mean, and if and out of 10 seeds, seven of them, I grew out.
[24:31.930 --> 24:35.730]  And out of that seven, pretty much everyone, man, it was like consistent.
[24:36.490 --> 24:40.490]  I got a lot of other things going on in the same environment.
[24:40.490 --> 24:42.730]  So then they didn't get stressed that way.
[24:43.290 --> 24:50.930]  But I'm wondering if that's like a case of people getting too rambunctious or too ahead of themselves, trying to like cross things and put things out there.
[24:50.930 --> 24:58.650]  Or is there something to it like Kim D. Crosses can do that until you kind of that kind of stuff that matters?
[24:59.330 --> 25:09.450]  Yeah, with Kim D. stuff and like there's a lot of things they'll produce like those like very late manners, not all the time.
[25:09.450 --> 25:19.090]  But you might see one or two poke out the bud when you're, you know, in your last week, last couple of days or something, you know, there is there is that.
[25:19.410 --> 25:33.490]  But like what you're talking like when I see anything do that, especially in the in the 20s, that's telling me either like like, yeah, just genetically it's all confused and mixed up.
[25:34.250 --> 25:39.330]  Or there's some type of there's some type of stress that's been introduced.
[25:39.330 --> 25:51.090]  And like I said, you're growing that same thing amongst another population of what I'm assuming, knowing you, it's like it's pretty good variety of different things.
[25:52.530 --> 26:00.730]  You know, it's when you know, especially when it's more than one seed and all of them are kind of freaking out.
[26:01.010 --> 26:06.010]  And like I said, everything else in the room, it's like a variety of things is not freaking out.
[26:06.450 --> 26:10.210]  It's telling me that, well, you know, the feeds are on point, right?
[26:11.490 --> 26:14.330]  There's no light leaks and things of that nature.
[26:14.330 --> 26:20.410]  And there's nothing that's really, you know, trying to, you know, get things freaking out.
[26:20.730 --> 26:25.370]  So that would kind of, you know, lead me more to like this genetically.
[26:25.370 --> 26:28.810]  It's a little might be a little mixed up.
[26:28.810 --> 26:41.930]  But, you know, that's the other thing is like, yeah, it might have been it might have been free, you know, but man, like even when I would get free shit out, like I'd already at least grown a little bit of it.
[26:42.090 --> 26:43.090]  You know what I mean?
[26:43.130 --> 26:43.810]  Yeah.
[26:44.330 --> 26:52.450]  Just because like, you know, I don't I'm trying to waste somebody's time, you know, and, you know, their space and potentially like welcome like that.
[26:52.490 --> 27:00.290]  So, yeah, you know, some some of the some of the folks, yeah, they need to need to slow it down a little bit.
[27:00.290 --> 27:01.290]  And, you know.
[27:01.970 --> 27:03.130]  Yeah, I can dig that.
[27:03.130 --> 27:03.650]  I'm through.
[27:04.490 --> 27:09.970]  So so what that said, though, you know, I'm going to assume, you know, this gentleman took it to a certain point.
[27:09.970 --> 27:13.490]  OK, either worked it or maybe just threw a little pollen or whatever.
[27:14.170 --> 27:17.490]  And to his credit, the plants looked amazing.
[27:18.050 --> 27:24.890]  And to his credit, the plants looked amazing, even that first, you know, 20 days, 24 days and flower.
[27:25.250 --> 27:26.490]  It looked really good.
[27:26.490 --> 27:28.530]  Stem rubs loud, stanky.
[27:28.530 --> 27:30.090]  I was really looking forward to it.
[27:30.610 --> 27:38.010]  I mean, with that said, like, is there any way that you'd take some seeds like that and kind of maybe continue to work them?
[27:38.010 --> 27:45.730]  And if so, what would be some ways should I just keep interworking within the remaining seeds I have, you think, or what you what you think?
[27:46.730 --> 27:52.850]  Well, since they're them's, you won't have to worry about, like, you know, calling and shit.
[27:52.850 --> 27:59.850]  So like you keep calling males, you can at least predict how many you want to grow each run.
[28:00.330 --> 28:07.610]  And if it's something that's like really that appealing about it that you like, you really, really want.
[28:07.970 --> 28:23.090]  I mean, it could be, you know, just worth, you know, throwing a few in, do them small, maybe in a little smaller and more of them and just keep calling them out and calling them out and then, you know, find your find your clone, you know.
[28:24.690 --> 28:27.850]  But, you know, it just don't really use that for breeding stock.
[28:27.850 --> 28:32.210]  I would imagine it'd be more find that good clone you wanted and kind of lock in right there.
[28:32.490 --> 28:33.570]  Yeah, exactly.
[28:33.570 --> 28:37.850]  Unless you're like, oh, those people, that's a guess.
[28:38.610 --> 28:40.570]  People are getting hurt or whatever.
[28:41.530 --> 28:42.690]  Unless you're paying.
[28:42.930 --> 28:44.810]  Yeah. Unless you're into that, you know.
[28:44.890 --> 28:45.730]  Yeah, I got you.
[28:45.850 --> 28:48.170]  Yeah, I'd probably call it call it good right there.
[28:48.650 --> 28:49.250]  There you go.
[28:49.530 --> 28:51.010]  I do. Do you mind explaining?
[28:51.010 --> 28:55.690]  Because a lot of the audience is new to cannabis just in general, especially from farming.
[28:55.690 --> 29:07.810]  Can you kind of explain why regular seeds are coveted to some and why feminized seeds are coveted to some so that, you know, the average person can hear it from a breeder's point of view?
[29:08.290 --> 29:09.410]  Yeah, for sure.
[29:10.690 --> 29:17.010]  So naturally, the benefit of a fem seed versus a regular is.
[29:17.410 --> 29:25.330]  And I'm just assuming, you know, the newer people, it's like, all right, it's legal now.
[29:25.330 --> 29:33.130]  I'm allowed, you know, four plants, six plants, whatever you want to make the most of your plant count.
[29:33.450 --> 29:36.290]  So that that definitely helps with that.
[29:36.810 --> 29:37.570]  Um.
[29:39.050 --> 29:44.330]  Um, things when when bred in a in a feminized route.
[29:45.530 --> 29:51.290]  And when things are bred from a male perspective or a male route.
[29:53.130 --> 30:04.970]  So if I take plant a female plant, the male cross them right now have a F1 hybrid, there's going to be a variance, right?
[30:04.970 --> 30:11.090]  Like a like a spread of what you're going to see in its expression there.
[30:12.170 --> 30:15.130]  You're going to see some lean heavily toward mom.
[30:15.210 --> 30:19.610]  You're going to see a majority sharing, you know, little traits from each one.
[30:19.890 --> 30:32.570]  And then you're going to have some that are going to lean heavily toward like the dad side from what he was passing on on his X chromosome from his mother and so on and so forth.
[30:33.530 --> 30:45.530]  Um, if you take those seeds and you take a male and a female from from that and you cross them together, that's what you would call your F2 generation.
[30:45.530 --> 30:53.330]  So your F2 generation, you're going to get a way, way more diverse population, right?
[30:54.170 --> 31:00.130]  So within that diverse population, like you can find some really, really stellar stellar stuff.
[31:00.850 --> 31:10.170]  Now, on the feminized part of it, you can take a plant, female plant that's been reversed, right?
[31:10.610 --> 31:16.970]  And the pollen from that to another plant and make like a like a feminized hybrid.
[31:17.570 --> 31:20.490]  Now, the big, big thing.
[31:21.570 --> 31:31.810]  About the feminized thing is you might see S1, like of some real popular clone that you heard of and everything.
[31:32.450 --> 31:43.570]  So just so let it be known, like a lot of people assume like, oh, well, that that famous clone has been reversed onto itself and made these feminized seeds.
[31:43.570 --> 31:54.570]  I'm going to find, you know, an assortment of assortment, but they're thinking they're going to get corn from seed that way right off the bat.
[31:54.930 --> 32:02.810]  And more or less what's happened is that self generation you you essentially made the F2 generation.
[32:02.810 --> 32:05.890]  You're actually going to get quite a spread.
[32:07.330 --> 32:13.330]  If they do it again and make an S2, you'll see things begin to begin to tighten up.
[32:13.890 --> 32:19.690]  I've made films before.
[32:22.370 --> 32:24.250]  And I've done a lot of regs, too.
[32:27.130 --> 32:40.810]  Being as like when we're when we're only dealing with X chromosomes and just sharing basically the mitochondrial DNA and we're leaving out maybe certain Y link traits and stuff like that.
[32:41.450 --> 32:46.890]  Not everything reads out so well doing it, doing it that route.
[32:48.170 --> 32:50.130]  The same stuff applies, right?
[32:50.170 --> 32:56.730]  Like, you know, you're still making your selections and you're growing out a population and seeing seeing where you're at.
[32:57.770 --> 33:02.410]  Some things might have the look and everything else, but they don't have the punch.
[33:03.810 --> 33:07.210]  But that can happen with the with the with the regulars, too.
[33:07.610 --> 33:22.850]  Right. So no matter which way you're going, just do your homework and, you know, see that the people are are testing, you know, what they're putting out there.
[33:23.170 --> 33:25.690]  You really, really got to look at that.
[33:27.170 --> 33:31.730]  You know, that's the biggest, biggest advice that I could that I can give you.
[33:32.250 --> 33:44.210]  Me personally, like I can see where like if they are feminized or tested and shit like you can take it to the bank like you got four spots open, you can drop four seeds and, you know, be in there.
[33:46.250 --> 34:00.250]  Me like I wouldn't necessarily have a problem with, you know, you you call out some males and you keep some clones and then you just run run your favorite clones anyway, because you're going to you're probably going to do that with your film.
[34:00.290 --> 34:01.610]  Anyway, you're going to find a winner.
[34:02.010 --> 34:05.850]  You're going to keep coins of that and you're going to run that repeatedly.
[34:05.850 --> 34:15.250]  So, you know, it's just kind of kind of up to you because I guess always been like a big, big debate, which is regular or which is better regs or films.
[34:16.250 --> 34:19.570]  Are these more potent, better this way, that way?
[34:19.810 --> 34:28.810]  Honestly, they're both tools in the toolbox of breeding, you know, so you can you can you can breed some strings.
[34:29.370 --> 34:37.770]  You can breed some straight trash either way and you can you can you can make some gold either way and sometimes maybe even both.
[34:37.770 --> 34:41.650]  So you can take take that for what it's worth, I guess.
[34:42.330 --> 34:49.690]  So so do you think it would be better than to start stabilizing a regular line?
[34:49.930 --> 34:56.090]  Let's go regular, stabilize that and then do some film to kind of strengthen it later.
[34:56.090 --> 34:57.130]  Or do you think you know what?
[34:57.170 --> 34:58.010]  What do you think on that?
[34:59.330 --> 35:03.930]  Um, it kind of kind of depends on what you're what you're working with.
[35:03.930 --> 35:21.170]  If you're if you're dealing with true breeding, true breeding varieties for the for the traits that you're looking for versus say not not true breeding traits that you're looking at and the amount of work that it's going to take to get there.
[35:22.370 --> 35:24.930]  You can you can do that through feminization.
[35:25.770 --> 35:27.370]  You can do it through regs.
[35:27.770 --> 35:33.210]  You might find one works better than the other or it might get you there might get you there quicker.
[35:34.690 --> 35:35.810]  By a little thing.
[35:37.810 --> 35:48.890]  And you know, and if you were to do it, you know, both ways, you might see, you know, one expressions great on, you know, the feminized route, or it might be lacking in another thing.
[35:48.890 --> 35:54.570]  And on the other route that that, you know, it was it had what it was lacking.
[35:55.050 --> 36:02.650]  And you might you might combine those together at the end, and you might actually end up with the full package.
[36:02.650 --> 36:06.530]  So, you know, just yeah, you just kind of got to go for it.
[36:07.210 --> 36:11.450]  And then look at your progeny and see see what's actually going on.
[36:11.730 --> 36:14.610]  And then kind of make your make your decision from there.
[36:14.930 --> 36:24.690]  Because like, yeah, like there's all this, you know, technology and like people go on and on about it like, oh, yeah, you know, you could do these markers and this and that.
[36:24.690 --> 36:43.810]  It's like, hey, man, unless you got, you know, a million dollar lab, DNA, RNA synthesizer and, you know, spectrology and all the shit like you're going to you're going to have to do it this way, which is the old fashioned way using your using your senses.
[36:44.130 --> 36:50.050]  And, you know, looking at what's going on and predictability and things of that nature.
[36:50.050 --> 36:58.450]  And you got to go the long route and you're just going to have to grow them out and, you know, give the old pudding test.
[36:58.450 --> 36:59.570]  Get their work in.
[37:00.330 --> 37:01.530]  Yeah, that's it, man.
[37:01.730 --> 37:03.930]  Oh, man, there's no shortcuts.
[37:04.330 --> 37:05.410]  Oh, man.
[37:05.490 --> 37:07.250]  Oh, I don't want to grow.
[37:07.810 --> 37:08.810]  I would.
[37:08.810 --> 37:12.210]  You know, what are your thoughts on the autos and kind of how things are improving?
[37:12.210 --> 37:21.210]  But at the same time, it's still like, you know, from your standpoint, like, how are you going to really work with those lines if everything once it's flowered out is gone forever?
[37:21.930 --> 37:27.810]  Right. Yeah, there there is that, you know, you're not not looking to keep clones.
[37:27.810 --> 37:31.090]  You might just be looking to run through them.
[37:31.090 --> 38:00.970]  They're they're not they're not my thing, but, you know, maybe I could I could see the potential for it if, you know, you're in some type of like a legal market and you were able to have like an auto film from seed that was still, you know, super banging and able to select the seed out a whole field and rock and roll it for maybe like hash production, you know, like the vape cart market or something.
[38:01.090 --> 38:05.770]  Like that, you know, it might be might be pretty, pretty good, pretty profitable.
[38:07.330 --> 38:09.330]  So, yeah, I could see it that route.
[38:09.530 --> 38:17.050]  But like, you know, me and I'm just going to do my normal, normal thing and keep coins and do a lot of freezer.
[38:18.010 --> 38:26.370]  Right. Yeah, that soccer mom, we like I guess it doesn't really matter unless until it really gets to the pen.
[38:26.370 --> 38:27.570]  Right. Yeah.
[38:27.930 --> 38:38.010]  Yeah, exactly. It's it's it really comes down to the mylar bag, you know, and the and the artwork on it and everything, you know, that's that's what's really important, you know.
[38:38.570 --> 38:40.330]  Facts. Absolutely.
[38:41.370 --> 38:49.010]  Yeah. So, again, you're one of the first ones that kind of start to teach people that, you know, read the labels.
[38:49.050 --> 38:53.370]  You know, I don't I think a lot of us just fell into the trap.
[38:53.370 --> 38:56.090]  Hey, they gave me this cool little manual every week.
[38:56.090 --> 38:58.210]  I follow this and my weeds.
[38:58.250 --> 39:02.330]  OK, you know, you're the one that was my book, at least the first one.
[39:02.330 --> 39:05.570]  I was like, yeah, that's just probably yucca extract and cranberry juice.
[39:05.570 --> 39:14.050]  So do you mind kind of briefly kind of I know that was a nice rant that night, but do you mind kind of going on a brief rant about what's in a lot of that stuff?
[39:14.050 --> 39:19.730]  And I know there's other products out there that have improved, but especially back in the day, what was really in that stuff?
[39:20.730 --> 39:30.730]  Yeah, you know, there was a lot of like popular things that were it's like Epsom salt and like lemon and lime juice.
[39:32.730 --> 39:38.730]  Basically, oyster shell and some dolomite lime and molasses mixed together.
[39:39.730 --> 39:41.730]  It's a lot of these things.
[39:43.730 --> 39:47.730]  They can be made, made at home.
[39:48.730 --> 40:03.730]  Especially, you know, for the for the organic crowd out there, I'm not when I have some more time, like I'm looking to learn, I guess, more about K&F and J.
[40:03.730 --> 40:22.730]  Damn, I mean, something thing, but definitely looking to learn more about that, because it's just really it's really cool that like people are, you know, they're making their own stuff and like not just looking at it like, you know, this is that, you know, and I'm just doing it.
[40:22.730 --> 40:33.730]  But like what's within that, like, you know, not just like nutrient, but like those naturally occurring PGRs, you know, that come within, you know, organic.
[40:34.730 --> 40:40.730]  So like, you know, the alfalfa and the trichotinole and all that shit.
[40:41.730 --> 40:46.730]  So and that's what it all boils down to is a lot of like the fancy products.
[40:47.730 --> 41:00.730]  It might just be basically a little cow mag made from dolomite lime, maybe some oyster shell broken down with some molasses in there.
[41:01.730 --> 41:03.730]  They add a little kelp extract to it.
[41:04.730 --> 41:08.730]  And then, you know, they call it call it good last sticker.
[41:08.730 --> 41:09.730]  Forgot that. Right.
[41:10.730 --> 41:12.730]  Yeah, you gotta have the cool sticker.
[41:13.730 --> 41:18.730]  And then later you will get into my bags with cool cool logo.
[41:19.730 --> 41:24.730]  Yeah. So basically, yeah, a lot of a lot of things you can make yourself.
[41:26.730 --> 41:30.730]  But unlike the same token, like it does take time, it does take space.
[41:31.730 --> 41:36.730]  You know, some people are working, you know, in a 60 hour weeks and shit.
[41:36.730 --> 41:39.730]  And we got the family and all that ain't got time for all that.
[41:39.730 --> 41:40.730]  Or maybe do the space.
[41:41.730 --> 41:47.730]  But if you do have time and space and it's like, you know, big hobby and everything, you want to save some cheddar.
[41:48.730 --> 41:52.730]  Yeah, you can you can really look at it and you can you can make all your own stuff.
[41:53.730 --> 41:58.730]  Like I've been giving out soul recipes and regimens and shit like that for years.
[41:58.730 --> 42:02.730]  Maybe 2 percent of those people actually do it.
[42:03.730 --> 42:14.730]  Everybody else is like, oh, it's that's a lot of work, you know, so, you know, but it's out there, you know, information and knowledge and all that.
[42:14.730 --> 42:18.730]  So if you're looking to do it, yeah, definitely, definitely should.
[42:19.730 --> 42:24.730]  And then, like, you know, there's the guys with the salts, you know, they spend shit ton of money, man.
[42:25.730 --> 42:36.730]  And a lot of these companies are just still going off the old same old recipes like used to use with the old, the old Peters, you know, fucking Jacks and all that shit from way back.
[42:36.730 --> 42:41.730]  And are people that used to source their insults and everything, you know, it's the same shit.
[42:41.730 --> 42:49.730]  But instead of growing for two hundred dollars a year, you know, the guys are dumping ten thousand, fifteen thousand a year on these.
[42:50.730 --> 42:53.730]  Making people worry that was a that was like a badge of honor.
[42:54.730 --> 42:56.730]  Oh, yeah. Oh, man.
[42:56.730 --> 42:58.730]  I'm using a house and garden nutrients.
[42:58.730 --> 43:00.730]  I'm spending thousands on the shooting power.
[43:00.730 --> 43:02.730]  It's like, well, what's in that?
[43:02.730 --> 43:04.730]  I never looked.
[43:04.730 --> 43:06.730]  Never thought about it either.
[43:06.730 --> 43:07.730]  Yeah.
[43:07.730 --> 43:09.730]  Like, you know, the money was so good.
[43:09.730 --> 43:13.730]  So the people that really understood that they could handle it.
[43:14.730 --> 43:15.730]  Oh, yeah, man.
[43:15.730 --> 43:16.730]  Yeah.
[43:16.730 --> 43:24.730]  That and the other problem was like back in the day, like you, you couldn't or you shouldn't be going to a to a hydro store, you know what I mean?
[43:24.730 --> 43:25.730]  Get him the fuck up.
[43:25.730 --> 43:29.730]  So you got to be kind of hip to, you know, making your own shit anyway.
[43:29.730 --> 43:36.730]  So I said, I'd rather money be in my pocket than, you know, somebody else's more power to him.
[43:36.730 --> 43:39.730]  Like, don't get me wrong, but, you know, exactly.
[43:39.730 --> 43:43.730]  You know, if I can change my oil and all that shit, I'm going to change my oil.
[43:43.730 --> 43:57.730]  You know, I mean, you want to be different, you know, you know, until until changing the oil costs me money, meaning I can't be somewhere else making more money.
[43:57.730 --> 43:59.730]  You know, change my own.
[43:59.730 --> 44:00.730]  Exactly.
[44:00.730 --> 44:01.730]  Man, exactly.
[44:01.730 --> 44:10.730]  I do everything I can, you know, and like certain things, like I feel like I can refine it maybe a little bit, a little bit better for my own needs and everything.
[44:10.730 --> 44:15.730]  So, you know, I guess we can I'm going to be making some jungle juice, man.
[44:15.730 --> 44:31.730]  And you want to go on fruit shopping to the to the hippie grocery store and get all them good organic fruits and everything and get the old Jacqueline food processor out and start juicing, you know, get that back in the work.
[44:31.730 --> 44:34.730]  That's like, Kevin would be like water skiing when he was 80.
[44:34.730 --> 44:35.730]  Yes.
[44:35.730 --> 44:36.730]  Yeah.
[44:36.730 --> 44:37.730]  Yeah.
[44:37.730 --> 44:42.730]  I said the crispy can to just is all it has to be flexible to bed.
[44:42.730 --> 44:45.730]  He'd be like pumping that fucking shit up.
[44:45.730 --> 44:46.730]  Going on.
[44:46.730 --> 44:47.730]  Yeah.
[44:47.730 --> 44:49.730]  You know, that's right.
[44:49.730 --> 44:51.730]  Fired up, fired up for that.
[44:51.730 --> 44:54.730]  Yes, man.
[44:54.730 --> 44:55.730]  That's what's up.
[44:55.730 --> 44:57.730]  Show the people you don't have to go to the stores.
[44:58.730 --> 45:01.730]  I'm going to a grocery store this Saturday doing a little education thing.
[45:01.730 --> 45:07.730]  But I told the owner, unfortunately, I will be trying to show them how to stay out of here.
[45:07.730 --> 45:09.730]  You know what I mean?
[45:09.730 --> 45:12.730]  There's always there's some stuff you can go in there and buy.
[45:12.730 --> 45:14.730]  You always need a little something.
[45:14.730 --> 45:15.730]  Not the nutrients.
[45:15.730 --> 45:16.730]  Not that.
[45:16.730 --> 45:18.730]  Yeah, man.
[45:19.730 --> 45:28.730]  The key to me always was once I had a good base built, once my soul was where I wanted to be and I got it in pots.
[45:28.730 --> 45:38.730]  You know, microbes like, yeah, you know, but that's the thing is like people are, you know, getting into farming their own microbes and all now, too.
[45:38.730 --> 45:41.730]  But, you know, getting microbes, that was one thing.
[45:41.730 --> 45:45.730]  But everything else, you know, you know, I always had the back one.
[45:45.730 --> 46:00.730]  I left over from mixing the soil up and then beyond that, like sets them up, some salt, some molasses, you know, fruit juice and fruit blended up, you know, not not really a really much, much other than that, you know.
[46:02.730 --> 46:03.730]  Keeping it natural.
[46:05.730 --> 46:06.730]  Keeping it simple.
[46:06.730 --> 46:09.730]  Even a cheap to keep it real cheap.
[46:10.730 --> 46:17.730]  Yeah, I guess it's silly to be spending a ton of money now doing this, especially with all the free education that's out there.
[46:17.730 --> 46:21.730]  I mean, there's just so many different ways to make better nutrients that you can find.
[46:22.730 --> 46:24.730]  Marco and I talk about this each and every week.
[46:25.730 --> 46:40.730]  Like when you're getting more of like now you're getting into like the composting worms and, you know, that whole like soil food web, rove beetle style where you're being active in building up your mother nature as your living soil system is starting to come alive and thriving.
[46:40.730 --> 47:06.730]  I think that's how a proactive farmer is able to stay ahead on a lot of this stuff is they just start, you know, if it's a marathon race and that's obviously the way you're looking at it, then we also need to start our aspects to combat, you know, bad pest pressures or, you know, combative pest pressures by using our own combative measures by, you know, going out of our way to understand predatory mites and stuff.
[47:07.730 --> 47:10.730]  So was there things that you felt like were worthwhile?
[47:10.730 --> 47:18.730]  I mean, you know, Marco and I talked to the experts too, and they say to use these things and some of the predatory mites are, do seem like they actually work.
[47:18.730 --> 47:23.730]  And then some of the like super expensive, finicky ones, the humidity has to be dialed in.
[47:23.730 --> 47:29.730]  I'm still on the fence of those are actually worth it for anything more than maybe just the tent glow.
[47:30.730 --> 47:31.730]  Yeah.
[47:31.730 --> 47:43.730]  My thing, because we're looking at it nowadays, you know, it could be, you know, we're just doing our doing our thing at home.
[47:43.730 --> 47:52.730]  You know, we got the little spare room or, you know, we got the tent or a couple of tents and then, you know, then there's making money.
[47:52.730 --> 47:53.730]  Right.
[47:53.730 --> 47:58.730]  We got 100 lighter going on, you know, bigger, a little smaller, whatever.
[47:58.730 --> 47:59.730]  Right.
[48:00.730 --> 48:04.730]  Certain things we have in control in our home.
[48:04.730 --> 48:12.730]  Right. Whereas we're going to lose some of those controls if we're doing more of what is called a commercial commercial scale.
[48:12.730 --> 48:14.730]  Right. So.
[48:15.730 --> 48:22.730]  Things that would be like in my control is, well, I can I don't have people over.
[48:22.730 --> 48:29.730]  Right. I'm not I'm not taking in, you know, random random clones, shit like that.
[48:30.730 --> 48:35.730]  My environment's basically sealed off to just me and I can control just me.
[48:36.730 --> 48:41.730]  You know, if I'm out back, you know, working in the field and shit and chopping weeds or doing whatever.
[48:42.730 --> 48:50.730]  And, you know, my ass stripping them clothes off, you know, I'm getting the water scrub it up, you know, put some clean clothes on before I go back and I do my thing.
[48:52.730 --> 48:58.730]  Not having people over, you know, because, you know, you just pick up some random growers off the street.
[48:58.730 --> 49:00.730]  Hey, we'll see about that, bro. Shit, man.
[49:00.730 --> 49:04.730]  I have some powdery mildew spores up in the dreadlocks or something.
[49:04.730 --> 49:07.730]  And you just never know. Right.
[49:08.730 --> 49:11.730]  They might they might have crabs and spider mites.
[49:11.730 --> 49:13.730]  Real. So you just you just don't know.
[49:14.730 --> 49:18.730]  Also, keeping the pets out out of the room because like one, like there's a hair thing.
[49:18.730 --> 49:27.730]  But to like, you know, dog goes run through them weeds and let them on up and you should, you know, you might bring you maybe some spider mites or something.
[49:28.730 --> 49:37.730]  Taking in the clones from random places, from stores and, you know, you buy these clones wherever, you know, as a tricky business to.
[49:37.730 --> 49:43.730]  So versus say like, you know, something like large scale, you're going to lose a lot of that control.
[49:43.730 --> 49:45.730]  You got employees. You don't know what they're doing.
[49:46.730 --> 49:51.730]  They might they might have their tent in their house and they might they might have nasty friends.
[49:51.730 --> 49:56.730]  They might have russets and they might have the fuck knows man.
[49:56.730 --> 50:00.730]  Fungus gnats. They got fucking spider mites riding on their ass.
[50:00.730 --> 50:04.730]  You know what I mean? Like you just never know. And then they come to work and boom.
[50:05.730 --> 50:17.730]  So to me, like IPM on something like that, I would be a lot, a lot heavier, a lot heavier on me personally.
[50:18.730 --> 50:22.730]  Just for like my little little medical thing at the house or whatever.
[50:24.730 --> 50:33.730]  You know, I still do an IPM as far as like, you know, I'll spray a little something, you know, here and there.
[50:33.730 --> 50:40.730]  But I'm I'm more along the lines of like an ounce of prevention is worth 100 pounds of cure.
[50:40.730 --> 50:45.730]  So I'm just looking to block that off. And I keep a vigilant eye out, you know.
[50:46.730 --> 50:59.730]  And I'm more into the microbial thing because like to me, like the likelihood of like a bug thing happening versus like a spore that I don't see.
[50:59.730 --> 51:03.730]  So I'm more I'm more vigilant against, say, like powdery mildew.
[51:03.730 --> 51:13.730]  And I really like the some of those exotic beneficial microbes that you can spray around and keep your mom's good and happy and healthy.
[51:13.730 --> 51:24.730]  Well, mineral oil and like, you know, I try to like make it like it's a it's a food thing to along with the preventative maintenance, you know, all in one.
[51:24.730 --> 51:35.730]  You know, that's why I like to like to be at. Like I said, just being very vigilant, you know, watching, looking, getting you like a little cheap digital scope.
[51:35.730 --> 51:38.730]  You know what I mean? Check your leaves out and everything.
[51:38.730 --> 51:43.730]  And, you know, you said just a little bit of prevention goes goes a hell of a long way.
[51:44.730 --> 51:52.730]  Yeah, yeah, it does. Man, noticing things early is huge, like, you know, little things, notice that little thing that's not supposed to be on your plan.
[51:52.730 --> 51:55.730]  And ask yourself, what is it? Why is it there?
[51:56.730 --> 52:03.730]  Yeah, man, I've been I've been fortunate enough to we got a Christmas gift last, you know, obviously last Christmas.
[52:03.730 --> 52:09.730]  This is thing called Masterclass. Right. And you get to hear from like super famous people and they break shit down.
[52:10.730 --> 52:20.730]  And what I'm learning from watching a lot of these people like, you know, some of these are like extremely famous individuals is that it's the fucking basics for whatever you're trying to do.
[52:20.730 --> 52:25.730]  Like when you're getting down to the this kind of stuff, it sounds almost like like, yeah, I mean, yeah, of course.
[52:26.730 --> 52:29.730]  But most people just don't put in the basic work at the beginning.
[52:30.730 --> 52:35.730]  They always are thinking ahead, trying to get more to like wait is, you know, where it's at, because that's where the money is.
[52:35.730 --> 52:41.730]  But, you know, watching this show and I think other shows, more people will realize that it's all about the repeat business.
[52:42.730 --> 52:45.730]  If you get people to come back to you, then you'll have to go out there and work so hard.
[52:45.730 --> 52:56.730]  You can just get out there and focus on your farm, because when you do start to build up your own brand and kind of the underground aspects, you have to, in a way, understand, obviously, creating the product.
[52:56.730 --> 53:02.730]  But you got to find networking skills. And a lot of us, including myself, for a long time, I liked kind of being recluse.
[53:03.730 --> 53:05.730]  You know, it was just myself and a business partner for a while.
[53:05.730 --> 53:10.730]  And we kind of lived that lifestyle for years where it was just no one came to the house.
[53:10.730 --> 53:15.730]  I don't give a fuck, you know, your mom, you know, no one came to the fucking house.
[53:16.730 --> 53:19.730]  And there were certain rules on that that allowed us to be successful.
[53:20.730 --> 53:29.730]  But then on the same time, Duke, I think I lost myself a little bit as well, because we got kind of like, you know, we were eating a lot of mushrooms too back then and stuff.
[53:29.730 --> 53:32.730]  So it was kind of like, you know, you want to remember that society is out there.
[53:33.730 --> 53:35.730]  You want to interact with people. So there's a balance there.
[53:35.730 --> 53:43.730]  But the ego of wanting to show off your grow when you first start out, especially if you're successful, I think that temptation is there for everybody that first starts out.
[53:44.730 --> 53:50.730]  But once it's become kind of more of just mainstream, you know, I would hope that you kind of move on past that point.
[53:50.730 --> 53:55.730]  So if you know from the beginning, hey, you're going to feel like you want to show off, it's like a new car, I guess, or something to you.
[53:56.730 --> 53:58.730]  You know, you're successful at doing something fun.
[53:58.730 --> 54:04.730]  But you need to resist that temptation because that is the number one way I think why we fucked up a ton of grows.
[54:05.730 --> 54:09.730]  We first started out is because we were always inviting people over asking what the problems were.
[54:09.730 --> 54:13.730]  I think those problems were is that we kept inviting people over that had spider.
[54:14.730 --> 54:15.730]  It was more like spider mites back then.
[54:16.730 --> 54:19.730]  And then, of course, Russet mites is that times 10 when you're a brand new farmer.
[54:20.730 --> 54:21.730]  Yeah, man.
[54:22.730 --> 54:31.730]  And like I said, the people, they're trying to just totally skip the script.
[54:32.730 --> 54:34.730]  You know, like you got to start basic.
[54:35.730 --> 54:38.730]  You got to try to master those basics.
[54:39.730 --> 54:41.730]  And then, you know, you go from there.
[54:42.730 --> 54:56.730]  And if you get those basics down and you're doing very well and you got a friend, you know, it's like, yeah, I'm doing this because your friend is showing you their weed.
[54:57.730 --> 54:58.730]  Maybe they're growing the same thing.
[54:58.730 --> 55:03.730]  You're like, wow, they're yielding a little more or there's a little smellier or whatnot.
[55:04.730 --> 55:07.730]  And they turn you on to some things that they do.
[55:08.730 --> 55:11.730]  I don't recommend changing more than one thing at a time.
[55:12.730 --> 55:15.730]  That way you got some type of metric to say this worked.
[55:15.730 --> 55:16.730]  This did not work.
[55:17.730 --> 55:20.730]  And you can narrow it down because you change the one thing.
[55:21.730 --> 55:36.730]  So just keeping it simple and building slowly because, you know, I can't count how many times people say like, oh, yeah, you know, my shit's looking potentially good.
[55:37.730 --> 55:40.730]  I'm potassium deficient, nitrogen deficient and this and that.
[55:41.730 --> 55:49.730]  But, you know, and they start wanting to feed more and more and more and they don't realize like you've been feeding cow mag like it's going out of style.
[55:50.730 --> 55:54.730]  You've introduced like a lock out through this toxicity.
[55:55.730 --> 56:04.730]  So, you know, understanding the basics of plant available, not plant available, mobile nutrients, immobile nutrients.
[56:04.730 --> 56:12.730]  Understanding those basics and what the plant needs at its most basic level to do what you want it to do.
[56:13.730 --> 56:20.730]  And then watering, you know, people thinking, oh, man, I'm getting all these problems and it's dripping these russets.
[56:21.730 --> 56:24.730]  It's like, well, they're waterlogging their plants.
[56:25.730 --> 56:26.730]  You know, they're watering way too much.
[56:27.730 --> 56:29.730]  They don't put enough aeration in their soil or whatnot.
[56:29.730 --> 56:33.730]  And they're going off with some guy saying, oh, yeah, I'm watering every other day.
[56:34.730 --> 56:35.730]  And then they're watering every other day.
[56:36.730 --> 56:38.730]  But the guy every other day has got more aeration in his soil.
[56:39.730 --> 56:41.730]  Maybe his humidity is not in check.
[56:42.730 --> 56:46.730]  Maybe he's running at like 25 percent and, you know, your humidity is not in check either.
[56:47.730 --> 56:56.730]  And you're like, you know, 70 percent, you know, environmental variables, you know, you can't go on like a cookie cutter thing, you know.
[56:56.730 --> 57:03.730]  So by understanding those basics, you know, you'll be a lot better off for it, you know.
[57:04.730 --> 57:06.730]  And it's going to keep you from running into problems.
[57:07.730 --> 57:09.730]  And if you do run into a problem, you'll know how to remedy it.
[57:10.730 --> 57:11.730]  You know, yeah.
[57:12.730 --> 57:18.730]  Yeah. That part I was joking is we're now calling that a Jay-Z bar, man, because it's off the cuff and it's just terrific.
[57:19.730 --> 57:25.730]  It's like, you know, a legendary bar because especially when you first get into it, man, you learn about kelp.
[57:26.730 --> 57:27.730]  You learn about crab meals.
[57:28.730 --> 57:40.730]  Like you start adding all these different amendments, you know, Layton's famous for saying that, you know, you're being a moron, meaning that you're just putting more on and more on just to like, I don't know, to make things shiny, I guess, or to feel like you're really farming.
[57:41.730 --> 57:53.730]  And then, of course, when you when you start to actually get some stripes, you know, on your on your vest, you realize that it is it's the simple stuff and kind of breaking this stuff down and realizing, right, I added one amendment.
[57:53.730 --> 57:55.730]  I'm going to see how these things work out.
[57:55.730 --> 57:57.730]  I'm going to really pay attention to this.
[57:58.730 --> 58:10.730]  Those are people probably have wasted months or years, not really even kind of just coasting probably in life and not realizing what they were doing by just constantly being like, oh, man, there's some kind of deficiency.
[58:10.730 --> 58:14.730]  OK, let's add more kelp or like there was a joke for a while.
[58:15.730 --> 58:23.730]  More cow, cow mag like the more cowbell from the Saturday Night Live skits, you know, like people just thought that that's how you grew high in cannabis and you want to.
[58:25.730 --> 58:32.730]  It was just silly, man, and the forums and stuff is why I think those really started to take off when they did is because people were having so many problems.
[58:33.730 --> 58:34.730]  They were just trying to find ways.
[58:35.730 --> 58:42.730]  And of course, as time progressed, like overgrow was one that I thought where people were actually trying to help each other, not troll each other.
[58:43.730 --> 58:49.730]  Yeah. And, you know, the thing is like these plants, you know, they're not strippers at the shoe show, man.
[58:50.730 --> 58:52.730]  They don't respond to dollars being thrown at them, right?
[58:53.730 --> 58:54.730]  Like that doesn't work.
[58:55.730 --> 58:57.730]  You know, they're you know, and they have very basic needs.
[58:58.730 --> 59:00.730]  And it's one of those things where less is more.
[59:01.730 --> 59:14.730]  And when it comes to when it comes to growing weed, man, like I've always noticed, it's like very typically the majority of people, they never underdo shit.
[59:15.730 --> 59:18.730]  It's always over, like way too much of this, way too much of that.
[59:19.730 --> 59:29.730]  You know, you got to hit the hit the median and, you know, and maybe try working yourself up instead of going way on the high end, you know, because, you know,
[59:30.730 --> 59:36.730]  I've had a lot of friends that were going that route and you give them a clone, they grow it.
[59:37.730 --> 59:41.730]  And, you know, their yields are kind of shit, you know, half or less.
[59:42.730 --> 59:43.730]  And you're like, what the hell are you doing?
[59:44.730 --> 59:48.730]  And you find out, you know, their feed regimen and say, hey, man, you're running that way too hot.
[59:49.730 --> 59:53.730]  And they're not necessarily, you know, seeing burns and shit like that.
[59:53.730 --> 01:00:02.730]  But, you know, I'm like, well, you know, why don't you cut that feed in half basically and try running it like that and see the yields and the quality go up.
[01:00:03.730 --> 01:00:12.730]  So, you know, less is more in most cases, you know, and you'll definitely as you're growing plants.
[01:00:13.730 --> 01:00:19.730]  That's another thing is people are constantly switching up for the next best thing and the next best thing.
[01:00:20.730 --> 01:00:27.730]  And like this market, especially with the seeds and everything, there's dudes are like looking to push like here's the next thing, here's the next thing.
[01:00:28.730 --> 01:00:33.730]  People aren't really running the same thing over and over and over and really dialing things in.
[01:00:34.730 --> 01:00:40.730]  But, you know, if you do have something very special, definitely put that work in to dial it in.
[01:00:41.730 --> 01:00:45.730]  You know, so like from seed, I'll grow everything.
[01:00:46.730 --> 01:00:49.730]  You know, I might give a couple of little pinches to get it to push up a little bit.
[01:00:50.730 --> 01:00:54.730]  But I grow it more all natural and I kind of see what all is going on.
[01:00:55.730 --> 01:00:58.730]  Then, you know, I'm going to find my keeper.
[01:00:59.730 --> 01:01:07.730]  And then on the next round, if it's something like I'm really into, I'll take multiple clones and I'm going to grow these clones.
[01:01:07.730 --> 01:01:09.730]  And one of them I'm going to top.
[01:01:10.730 --> 01:01:18.730]  Another one I'm going to really, really bush it out and have like eight, ten, twelve tops all growing off.
[01:01:19.730 --> 01:01:26.730]  And then I'll probably grow another one that's a couple pinches, bush it up, a little bit of a dominant cola.
[01:01:27.730 --> 01:01:29.730]  That way I can see if it's yielding right.
[01:01:30.730 --> 01:01:35.730]  If the plant gets all funky, you know, with distribution of growth toxins and all,
[01:01:36.730 --> 01:01:44.730]  instead of having ten big donkey dick buds, it all turned into a bunch of equally small buds that would have equaled to one.
[01:01:45.730 --> 01:01:46.730]  You know what I mean?
[01:01:47.730 --> 01:01:52.730]  So then you're understanding the best way to get your yields through your space management.
[01:01:53.730 --> 01:01:57.730]  You know, because like for y'all that are growing in a tent, you know, you're four by four.
[01:01:58.730 --> 01:02:01.730]  Every bit of that is very crucial.
[01:02:02.730 --> 01:02:11.730]  And back in the day, I saw some really amazing shit going down people just in like a spare closet where they made these little grow cabinets.
[01:02:12.730 --> 01:02:18.730]  And I mean utilizing every, every spare little inch of space to get the most out of it.
[01:02:19.730 --> 01:02:22.730]  So you can understand a little bit of what's going on there.
[01:02:23.730 --> 01:02:32.730]  And then maybe play around with the, you know, the one that you haven't topped all crazy or whatever that you grew like similar to the first run.
[01:02:33.730 --> 01:02:36.730]  Maybe try feeding that one a little bit, a little bit heavier.
[01:02:37.730 --> 01:02:39.730]  You know, maybe try to boost it up a little bit.
[01:02:40.730 --> 01:02:46.730]  You know, maybe you'll see things that you were correcting in round one where you were like, ah, you know, it seemed a little more hungry here.
[01:02:46.730 --> 01:02:55.730]  So try to correct that, you know, that next round and maybe give a little bit of a boost and see if you come out better on that.
[01:02:56.730 --> 01:03:05.730]  So after all this, you'll understand what's the best shape to go with and you'll get a better idea on like what it wants, you know, food wise and all.
[01:03:06.730 --> 01:03:12.730]  But also take some different buds, you know, at different harvest dates.
[01:03:12.730 --> 01:03:19.730]  Because like the last time, you know, you might have had your little jeweler's loop out and you're like, alright, 64 days seem to be the day.
[01:03:20.730 --> 01:03:23.730]  Well, your environment might have changed between then and now, plus you're running from clone.
[01:03:24.730 --> 01:03:30.730]  So you're scoping and, you know, look for that, that point like leading up right before that.
[01:03:31.730 --> 01:03:32.730]  Take a few buds before that day.
[01:03:33.730 --> 01:03:37.730]  Take some buds, you know, on that day and then leave some to go a little bit after that date.
[01:03:37.730 --> 01:03:47.730]  And then you might, you know, sample ones and be like, wow, you know, the stuff that was like three days later was a whole hell of a lot more potent and it had a little more stink and flavor on it too.
[01:03:48.730 --> 01:03:49.730]  So then you're starting to dial that in more.
[01:03:50.730 --> 01:03:52.730]  And then on your next run, you'll know what shape to grow.
[01:03:53.730 --> 01:04:01.730]  So you're growing them all the same shape and you'll be in that range of, you know, what it looked like when you pulled it and you felt that that was the best.
[01:04:01.730 --> 01:04:04.730]  And then play around with that, you know, day here, day there.
[01:04:05.730 --> 01:04:06.730]  Harvest tip too.
[01:04:07.730 --> 01:04:17.730]  And that's really, really how you'll get your shit dialed and you'll be able to grow it to like, you know, genetic potential, like the best that you can, you know.
[01:04:20.730 --> 01:04:29.730]  Yeah, I don't, you know, even we do this show every week, you know, I don't think enough people talk about like, especially at the beginning of understanding a balanced canopy and what that can really achieve for a room.
[01:04:30.730 --> 01:04:35.730]  Or what you can achieve if you only have a really kind of small space and you're just learning to dial in what you've got.
[01:04:36.730 --> 01:04:38.730]  Temperature is a big one too.
[01:04:39.730 --> 01:04:42.730]  Yeah, yeah. Temperature and humidity and airflow.
[01:04:43.730 --> 01:04:45.730]  So crucial, so crucial.
[01:04:46.730 --> 01:04:51.730]  And without environment, you know, you're not able to get it to go optimal.
[01:04:51.730 --> 01:05:02.730]  So like when you do have your environment really dialed in, you'll notice that, you know, it's growing faster, therefore it might want that extra feed, you know.
[01:05:03.730 --> 01:05:09.730]  And you'll see it, you know, come back quite a bit, you know.
[01:05:10.730 --> 01:05:13.730]  It's a huge difference if you can get your environment dialed.
[01:05:14.730 --> 01:05:20.730]  And like, I get it, like I've grown all types of fucked up spots, you know, just trying to make it happen.
[01:05:21.730 --> 01:05:35.730]  But in places, and especially nowadays, it's so much easier, you know, you don't have to dig out a hole underneath of a house and crawl under it to, you know, get your grow on and shit.
[01:05:36.730 --> 01:05:46.730]  You know, you can really dial those tents in, get your humidity and temperature just right and get everything, you know, dialed in this little microclimate.
[01:05:46.730 --> 01:05:57.730]  And like, I get it, you know, like, yeah, it might, you know, it might be legal, but still like you want to get the most that you can out of the space that you have.
[01:05:58.730 --> 01:06:07.730]  So, yeah, just understanding like environment and then nutrition and all that stuff will complement genetics.
[01:06:08.730 --> 01:06:10.730]  Genetics doesn't dictate those two.
[01:06:10.730 --> 01:06:13.730]  Those two will dictate the genetic and get into that potential.
[01:06:14.730 --> 01:06:18.730]  And then the rest is the X factor of yourself.
[01:06:19.730 --> 01:06:35.730]  And like I said, knowing the proper, proper watering and other various aspects of it, you know, keeping it simple and understanding the plant and then understanding your specific plant that you're trying to optimize.
[01:06:36.730 --> 01:06:47.730]  Yeah, keeping it, keeping it consistent to like you say, watering is big, keeping your water and consistent how you do it, how you apply that water and you want that soil to be evenly wet.
[01:06:48.730 --> 01:06:51.730]  You know, you know, for me, like you said, you had some great points.
[01:06:52.730 --> 01:06:56.730]  But like for me, growing a plant again is almost as fun as growing a new seed.
[01:06:57.730 --> 01:07:03.730]  Like when I'm doing it, like changing the temperature, like I got a strain that I really like growing.
[01:07:03.730 --> 01:07:05.730]  It grows really great in the cool.
[01:07:06.730 --> 01:07:08.730]  I grew it in the heat, didn't like it as much.
[01:07:09.730 --> 01:07:14.730]  It was still fire, but it was a lot hairier, you know, it didn't have that bag appeal, you know what I'm saying?
[01:07:15.730 --> 01:07:22.730]  So that's why, you know, temp's a big factor too to consider, you know, when you're thinking about that overall product.
[01:07:23.730 --> 01:07:26.730]  And, you know, we were talking about the old Gany, right?
[01:07:27.730 --> 01:07:29.730]  You know, one thing about her, she hates bright light.
[01:07:29.730 --> 01:07:35.730]  Like any time we grew it, you know, yeah, we'd either had the lights dimmed down a little bit for like big runs.
[01:07:36.730 --> 01:07:44.730]  Or like if she's just in the room, you know, and you got a plant or two for the head, you know, we always put her in the corner to the side as far away from the light.
[01:07:45.730 --> 01:07:46.730]  And she always performed the best.
[01:07:47.730 --> 01:07:53.730]  If you put it under, right directly under DE lights, man, and like everybody else is happy, man, she'd wilt down and everything.
[01:07:54.730 --> 01:07:55.730]  Not happy at all.
[01:07:56.730 --> 01:08:03.730]  Turn it down a little bit, she'd, you know, get kind of happy, but you'd see her go to sleep before the light comes off, you know, she's just overworking.
[01:08:04.730 --> 01:08:17.730]  So, you know, you do have that part to dial into, you know, you can get like a light meter and everything and figure out, you know, exactly what emuls are doing best for you.
[01:08:18.730 --> 01:08:25.730]  Like me personally, like I'll start off, you know, obviously like if you got signs, like it's too much light, you know, crank it the fuck down.
[01:08:26.730 --> 01:08:33.730]  But I'll start, you know, kind of median, you know, toward, you know, and kind of step it up a little bit.
[01:08:34.730 --> 01:08:42.730]  And then, you know, if you got a light meter or whatever, you can, you know, write it down, see where your emuls are at on the canopy and whatnot.
[01:08:42.730 --> 01:08:50.730]  And then, you know, on the next runs, right, you can tweak that a little bit and really dial that in as well.
[01:08:51.730 --> 01:08:57.730]  I think you want to be around like, what is it, like 800, you know, is pretty good.
[01:08:58.730 --> 01:09:03.730]  You know, some things take more, you know, things like that, Danny, are going to take a bit less.
[01:09:04.730 --> 01:09:05.730]  That's good to know, man.
[01:09:06.730 --> 01:09:07.730]  Yeah. Yeah.
[01:09:07.730 --> 01:09:14.730]  Because, you know, like I usually typically I like to be around a thousand and heavy, you know, heavy flower and going hard.
[01:09:14.730 --> 01:09:20.730]  But see, that's good to know on that, Danny, because I did get some some seeds from Jolly Pond Farm.
[01:09:20.730 --> 01:09:22.730]  I don't know if you know them. Shout out to them.
[01:09:22.730 --> 01:09:25.730]  They did a little Danny. Yeah, they're good people.
[01:09:25.730 --> 01:09:27.730]  He did a nice little Danny run.
[01:09:27.730 --> 01:09:29.730]  Some of run some of those seeds.
[01:09:29.730 --> 01:09:38.730]  And now knowing that now does the I guess she doesn't feed as heavy as well with that light or does she still eating heavy and just doesn't like that light?
[01:09:40.730 --> 01:09:46.730]  Doesn't like the light, just keep it between like seven and eight hundred, you know, somewhere in that range.
[01:09:48.730 --> 01:09:54.730]  Definitely defoliator like a little bit more so because like she she throws a lot of fans.
[01:09:54.730 --> 01:10:00.730]  So getting all those inward fans off and those innermost nodes, get them cleaned off.
[01:10:02.730 --> 01:10:15.730]  And. With her, it's pretty much like a median to low on the feed, you know, she'll she'll like, I know you're in soil, too.
[01:10:16.730 --> 01:10:19.730]  So, you know, the same shit applies, like I'd say.
[01:10:20.730 --> 01:10:25.730]  Well, back one, I would see week five, six, seven, you know what I mean?
[01:10:26.730 --> 01:10:28.730]  You know, putting on that a little bit of extra biomass.
[01:10:30.730 --> 01:10:33.730]  Calcium's kind of kind of a big thing with her, too.
[01:10:36.730 --> 01:10:40.730]  Yeah, and I run I run calcium on her to about week five.
[01:10:41.730 --> 01:10:47.730]  You know, and I'm also introducing a magnesium feed, you know, around then, too.
[01:10:48.730 --> 01:10:50.730]  And then keeping that three, five, six and seven.
[01:10:51.730 --> 01:10:52.730]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:10:54.730 --> 01:10:55.730]  Yeah, she's a little fat for you.
[01:10:56.730 --> 01:10:57.730]  Real, real fat.
[01:10:58.730 --> 01:10:59.730]  Oh, yeah, I'm looking forward to it.
[01:10:59.730 --> 01:11:04.730]  I know you'll know right away when it when it's that when it's got that turf that you're looking for with the game.
[01:11:05.730 --> 01:11:06.730]  Oh, yeah. Yeah.
[01:11:06.730 --> 01:11:07.730]  You smell it when you go in the room, man.
[01:11:08.730 --> 01:11:16.730]  Typically, like, yeah, the ones that do the best, like, you know, touch that bud and it's like sap, like pine tar, you know, sticky shit.
[01:11:18.730 --> 01:11:24.730]  Do that in your opinion, man, from the stuff that you've done, like when you're walking through the room, you do a stem rub.
[01:11:25.730 --> 01:11:27.730]  Is that a real good example of what it's going to be?
[01:11:28.730 --> 01:11:29.730]  OK, yeah.
[01:11:30.730 --> 01:11:31.730]  Do you mind kind of talking about that?
[01:11:31.730 --> 01:11:33.730]  So, like, it's cool.
[01:11:35.730 --> 01:11:49.730]  And I have I have seen it kind of be a little indicator, but maybe one percent of the time or less, you know, because, like, I've had some stuff that's like hella, hella nasty on the smell, like on a stem rub.
[01:11:50.730 --> 01:11:55.730]  And that's some of the freest, nicest shit that there is, you know, so you get so excited.
[01:11:57.730 --> 01:11:58.730]  Oh, I know. I know.
[01:11:58.730 --> 01:11:59.730]  I know.
[01:11:59.730 --> 01:12:03.730]  Like, is the stem rub gang that you breed and like that, too?
[01:12:04.730 --> 01:12:06.730]  I guess that's how they get them releases out so quick.
[01:12:07.730 --> 01:12:08.730]  I don't even know the female.
[01:12:08.730 --> 01:12:10.730]  But that's that one's got the rub, man.
[01:12:11.730 --> 01:12:13.730]  And I want that boy to that's my stud.
[01:12:14.730 --> 01:12:16.730]  Get these things made right off the get go.
[01:12:16.730 --> 01:12:17.730]  First one.
[01:12:20.730 --> 01:12:23.730]  Yeah, I got to agree, man, that rub is an all for me.
[01:12:23.730 --> 01:12:25.730]  And, you know, it isn't always 100.
[01:12:26.730 --> 01:12:28.730]  But you do get addicted to doing it, you know, go.
[01:12:29.730 --> 01:12:30.730]  Oh, yeah. Yeah.
[01:12:30.730 --> 01:12:31.730]  It ain't nothing wrong with it.
[01:12:31.730 --> 01:12:33.730]  Yeah. You know, there's nothing wrong with it.
[01:12:33.730 --> 01:12:43.730]  Like I like, you know, stinky plants and veg, you know, and it tells me a little something, you know, and it might not be indicative of the, you know, the the finish smell of that plant.
[01:12:43.730 --> 01:12:45.730]  But, you know, I do like that.
[01:12:45.730 --> 01:12:49.730]  It's putting in that that effort to put out a little stink for us.
[01:12:49.730 --> 01:12:51.730]  One thing I do is that now, Rob, I do a little crush.
[01:12:51.730 --> 01:12:52.730]  I crush my stems.
[01:12:52.730 --> 01:12:55.730]  I'm just, you know, I'm just in there observing the plants.
[01:12:55.730 --> 01:13:01.730]  I crush just one little crush, work it all the way up the stem, not to the point that it'll bend over.
[01:13:01.730 --> 01:13:06.730]  But then you'll notice it'll just start bulking up and just getting gnarly looking on the stems.
[01:13:07.730 --> 01:13:08.730]  Yeah, I do.
[01:13:08.730 --> 01:13:15.730]  If you're at that point to pull up, pull them little fans that are starting to go out, pull those little fans off the little nose right there.
[01:13:16.730 --> 01:13:18.730]  And then do that little pinch.
[01:13:18.730 --> 01:13:23.730]  And then once he's healed up, man, they'll they'll shoot off, become dominant branches on you.
[01:13:23.730 --> 01:13:27.730]  It's a good way to, like, fill in like those little little gap spaces and shit.
[01:13:27.730 --> 01:13:28.730]  Mm hmm.
[01:13:28.730 --> 01:13:30.730]  Oh, hey.
[01:13:30.730 --> 01:13:41.730]  So when you're running through your plants, doing pheno hunts and stuff and you and you see like, you know, in bed, some of these are starting to show rails and stuff, even on some of those smaller families.
[01:13:42.730 --> 01:13:47.730]  Is that indication of like, hey, this might be this might be a keeper we want to keep our eye on?
[01:13:47.730 --> 01:13:50.730]  And I guess is to twofold question.
[01:13:50.730 --> 01:13:57.730]  And then also sometimes with that, I've noticed that those same genetics, when you clone them, they'll bleed.
[01:13:58.730 --> 01:14:05.730]  Is that also indication of something that this is this should be at least, you know, you keep your eye on and really run through and see if it's a keeper.
[01:14:06.730 --> 01:14:10.730]  I don't get like more or resin production for me.
[01:14:11.730 --> 01:14:15.730]  That's automatically definitely going to like that.
[01:14:15.730 --> 01:14:23.730]  It might not end up being my my keeper because, you know, something else might have maybe a little less resin.
[01:14:23.730 --> 01:14:27.730]  But the terpene development was like way higher.
[01:14:27.730 --> 01:14:28.730]  It tasted better.
[01:14:28.730 --> 01:14:30.730]  It was more potent, you know.
[01:14:30.730 --> 01:14:32.730]  So, you know, it ain't a bad thing.
[01:14:32.730 --> 01:14:34.730]  If I get all the above, that's cool.
[01:14:34.730 --> 01:14:40.730]  Now on as far as like plants bleeding and stuff, it's like certain genetic lines.
[01:14:40.730 --> 01:14:42.730]  They typically do that.
[01:14:42.730 --> 01:14:49.730]  You know, a lot of certain types of sativa is like, there's like quite a few out there that do it.
[01:14:49.730 --> 01:14:52.730]  But, you know, it's it's pretty pretty good.
[01:14:52.730 --> 01:14:57.730]  Does that indicate anything that you should keep your eye on that or is that just, hey, every now and then certain genetics do that?
[01:14:58.730 --> 01:14:59.730]  Yeah, I mean, it could be.
[01:14:59.730 --> 01:15:11.730]  It depends on like maybe like the line you're you're breeding or growing, of course, like to finish flowers going to, you know, regenerate.
[01:15:11.730 --> 01:15:18.530]  There's, yeah, I mean it could be, it depends on the, like maybe like the line you're breeding
[01:15:18.530 --> 01:15:23.890]  or growing. Of course like the finished flower is gonna, you know, really tell you what's up, but
[01:15:24.530 --> 01:15:29.730]  during breeding that might be like one of those traits that could be predictable,
[01:15:29.730 --> 01:15:36.290]  you know, within a population. The ones that do typically exhibit this and this and, you know,
[01:15:36.290 --> 01:15:40.610]  might be those desired things that you're looking for and that might be something that
[01:15:40.610 --> 01:15:45.810]  might make or break it on your male selection, you know. It could be a good thing.
[01:15:47.650 --> 01:15:54.450]  And have you ever, when you're running through stuff, come across a mutant that you've actually
[01:15:54.450 --> 01:15:59.090]  ever had as a keeper? Or are those a complete waste of time?
[01:16:00.370 --> 01:16:06.530]  I've seen it go both ways, you know. Back in the day I grew like a bunch of DJ Short stuff
[01:16:07.090 --> 01:16:13.490]  and like he bred for mutants, you know, so like a bunch of crazy shit would pop out.
[01:16:15.490 --> 01:16:22.050]  And sometimes, yeah, you know, you find what you want. Other times, no. Within my own stuff,
[01:16:24.530 --> 01:16:31.570]  I've seen it kind of go both ways, you know. It depends on the mutation and all,
[01:16:31.570 --> 01:16:36.130]  you know. So, yeah, it just, it always kind of comes down to the,
[01:16:37.650 --> 01:16:45.170]  you know, that end result and what it's all about. You know, you get like trifolates and
[01:16:45.170 --> 01:16:52.690]  things like that and certain things like it seem like those females, which, you know, trifolates,
[01:16:52.690 --> 01:17:00.050]  you know, typically they're males, but that certain females that were trifolate were like,
[01:17:00.370 --> 01:17:05.330]  leaps and bounds better than the others, you know, across like a large population. So,
[01:17:06.050 --> 01:17:13.900]  you know, it's kind of cool. Yeah, man, there's such like a debate on that, whether they're worth
[01:17:13.900 --> 01:17:19.020]  your time or not. So I appreciate your candid response on that because, you know, it does seem
[01:17:19.020 --> 01:17:25.340]  like you can find some weird like duck foot, weird Dr. Chris style. I mean, I know those are very
[01:17:25.340 --> 01:17:29.420]  extreme variations and stuff, but. Oh, yeah. Yeah. I mean, everything in between.
[01:17:29.420 --> 01:17:36.060]  That's the thing, man. Yeah. You just never know what you're, what you might or might not find. I
[01:17:36.060 --> 01:17:41.820]  mean, like I've had little, little runt plants, you know, that most people are like, oh, you know,
[01:17:41.820 --> 01:17:47.740]  get it out, get it out, get it out. I've had it to where, yeah, they did suck and I did end up
[01:17:47.740 --> 01:17:52.780]  throwing them away at the end, but I've also had it come out, you know, and they were some of the
[01:17:52.780 --> 01:17:59.260]  best plants that there were out of the whole population. So, you know, it just depends,
[01:17:59.260 --> 01:18:05.340]  I guess, on your space and the person and, you know, but I found some real gems, man. So me
[01:18:05.340 --> 01:18:11.260]  personally, like I'll grow a mutant now, I'll run out, I'll let it have its day, you know,
[01:18:11.260 --> 01:18:19.020]  and so it shows me otherwise. You know, Beeleaf, his creature is like he's got a whole line off
[01:18:19.020 --> 01:18:24.380]  that and she's somewhat of a mutant, you know, and he doesn't release that plant per se because
[01:18:24.380 --> 01:18:27.980]  of the issues, but he creep throws out at everything and he comes out with some really
[01:18:27.980 --> 01:18:33.100]  nice stuff. So I think when you can dial it in and really work it, Brian, probably, you know,
[01:18:33.100 --> 01:18:39.180]  it's probably worth it, but it probably takes a lot of time to get there. Obviously. One thing
[01:18:39.180 --> 01:18:44.220]  about ruts, Duke, sorry, sorry to cut you off, when you, on ruts, like I'm doing a little selection,
[01:18:45.020 --> 01:18:51.180]  but like I got a rut in the group and I'm like not even gonna clone that, all right,
[01:18:51.180 --> 01:18:56.380]  because I'm not a breeder. Now as a breeder, would you go ahead and take one off that rut just in
[01:18:56.380 --> 01:19:00.860]  case the smoke and everything else was fired and you could throw that back at some or would you
[01:19:00.860 --> 01:19:07.580]  kind of say, nah, too small of stature, we're not even gonna mess with that. I typically clone
[01:19:07.580 --> 01:19:13.180]  everything. If you want the best weed of your life, don't clone it, you know what I mean? Correct.
[01:19:13.740 --> 01:19:17.660]  That's just how it's gonna work. You want it to rain, man, go wash your car,
[01:19:18.220 --> 01:19:23.580]  you know what I mean? Then you'll be trying to rebadge. Yeah, yeah, exactly, man, but yeah,
[01:19:24.140 --> 01:19:31.580]  I'm big on if I'm running through shit to find a keeper, I'm gonna keep a clone of everybody
[01:19:31.580 --> 01:19:39.900]  and see what all is going on and then at the end, and sometimes even like before I'm chopping,
[01:19:40.140 --> 01:19:46.940]  there's just some things, it's like there's no smell or anything, it's small or whatever,
[01:19:46.940 --> 01:19:52.220]  and it's like, yeah, even if it's the most potent in the world, I'm just wanting my thing so I can
[01:19:52.220 --> 01:19:58.380]  go ahead and say, all right, number 23, you're coming out, and then you go back to actually
[01:19:58.380 --> 01:20:04.940]  blazing and everything and revisiting each one over a month or so. You can whittle it down
[01:20:05.580 --> 01:20:12.940]  and normally you're always left with, it depends what you start with, but a good hunt for me
[01:20:12.940 --> 01:20:19.820]  typically always ends up with somewhere between five and seven that I always have a hard time
[01:20:19.820 --> 01:20:24.380]  with, and then I just kind of got to revisit them and then I'm growing them from clone again
[01:20:24.940 --> 01:20:31.820]  and then making up my mind. Does that equate to about 10% you think, man, roughly on what you do?
[01:20:32.380 --> 01:20:41.580]  Yeah, yeah, it can be, yeah, exactly. 10% are tough chores. Yeah, they really are, man,
[01:20:41.580 --> 01:20:49.100]  they really are. That makes sense. Yeah, normally I'll find good homes for them too because I have
[01:20:49.100 --> 01:20:55.980]  friends that's like four out of five of us all agree this one, but there's that one boy who's
[01:20:55.980 --> 01:20:59.820]  like, I don't know, man, that one there, and it's like, all right, well, there's your baby.
[01:21:02.380 --> 01:21:12.460]  Yeah, yeah, man. So what are your thoughts, man, kind of switching gears, I guess.
[01:21:13.020 --> 01:21:19.180]  So some people say, you know, depends where the seed was bred. Like, okay, there was bred in Cali
[01:21:19.180 --> 01:21:25.260]  in the desert hills and then I get it here in Virginia in the humid environment. Are those
[01:21:25.340 --> 01:21:30.460]  things that would be like stressful to the plant as it's growing, in your opinion?
[01:21:31.740 --> 01:21:39.020]  That's like, you know, epigenetics and acclimation and like that takes a hot minute,
[01:21:39.020 --> 01:21:48.060]  you know, to really play a part. And that's also something if you were growing something that's
[01:21:48.300 --> 01:21:57.660]  in say Afghanistan for like a thousand years, you know, the plants might just very obviously be very
[01:21:57.660 --> 01:22:04.380]  pissed off in your environment, but we're growing inside, right? And that's something in our control
[01:22:04.380 --> 01:22:11.980]  so we could kind of, you know, dial it in a little bit more, you know, to make those plants a little
[01:22:12.940 --> 01:22:16.220]  happier, you know, maybe run a little bit, a little dryer.
[01:22:16.780 --> 01:22:21.260]  As the grower, you want to go ahead and take control of that and give that plant what it wants
[01:22:21.260 --> 01:22:25.580]  and what it's been expecting, be more successful that way. Definitely.
[01:22:25.580 --> 01:22:32.380]  Yeah, yeah, if that's my jam, yeah, if that's my jam and I'm looking to hunt that out, you know,
[01:22:33.580 --> 01:22:38.380]  and have that clone that I'm going to keep, yeah, I want to, like I said, kind of cater to it
[01:22:38.940 --> 01:22:45.660]  and, you know, see what I can do. And then after that point, you know, maybe every time that,
[01:22:45.660 --> 01:22:51.500]  you know, it'll come around and join the others, you know, being happy.
[01:22:57.190 --> 01:22:59.830]  All right, man. So we got, what are you thinking about,
[01:23:02.070 --> 01:23:08.390]  so you don't like autos, we kind of got through that part. Switching more over to like...
[01:23:08.390 --> 01:23:09.190]  Not my place.
[01:23:10.070 --> 01:23:14.950]  Yeah, mine too, man. And I've talked to a lot of people and I still want to try them sometime,
[01:23:14.950 --> 01:23:16.630]  I just haven't gotten around to it.
[01:23:17.590 --> 01:23:22.950]  You know, I grew autos like way, way back in the day, man. Like, dude, this is M. Danzen,
[01:23:24.390 --> 01:23:29.830]  he had these ones called Low Riders. He sent me a whole, whole fuck ton of them, man. And I
[01:23:29.830 --> 01:23:34.790]  grew them out. I'm like, those are pretty neat, you know, just throw them out, you know, you get
[01:23:34.790 --> 01:23:42.550]  a little bud on the stem. Yeah, unless they don't work and then they end up being like a big old
[01:23:42.550 --> 01:23:48.790]  root or allis plant. Those ones suck. Because the idea was like, you know, you grow it around some
[01:23:48.790 --> 01:23:52.790]  hedges and some bushes and get your little gorilla grow on right in the city.
[01:23:54.470 --> 01:23:59.270]  Yeah, it don't matter. Something about that green that just stands out no matter how much green is
[01:23:59.270 --> 01:24:05.990]  around, you know, the mayor. Yeah, man. Yeah, I definitely do. No worries, man. It's just the
[01:24:05.990 --> 01:24:15.270]  creeper, man. That's right. Hey, so for like the younger dudes in the game that want to get into
[01:24:15.270 --> 01:24:21.190]  the washing, do you think moving forward, Duke, that you're going to kind of maybe start to focus
[01:24:21.830 --> 01:24:24.310]  more of your stuff for that aspect of the game?
[01:24:27.350 --> 01:24:35.510]  You know, that is a possibility. If I'm looking to do like a hash plant type of a,
[01:24:36.310 --> 01:24:42.470]  you know, project and stuff, that would be something that could be definitely considered.
[01:24:43.270 --> 01:24:52.230]  You know, even out of a population, you'll have just certain individuals that are more
[01:24:52.230 --> 01:24:58.870]  exceptional that will give you more of a return. That's just how it is. But in the past,
[01:24:58.870 --> 01:25:07.510]  I have been breeding more for certain residents versus others. But
[01:25:08.310 --> 01:25:13.750]  other times, it's just nothing you can really put in your control like that. You know,
[01:25:14.390 --> 01:25:18.310]  you're going after one thing. It might just be a real grease ball, you know.
[01:25:20.550 --> 01:25:25.670]  But yeah, it's always cool when they do. Another thing is like, you know, people say,
[01:25:25.670 --> 01:25:31.510]  oh yeah, it washes good. It washes good. It washes good. Yeah, great. But, you know, I notice them,
[01:25:31.510 --> 01:25:36.550]  man, like motherfuckers are taking some really gnarly weed and they're washing it and then it
[01:25:36.550 --> 01:25:42.550]  don't smell for shit. You know what I mean? Like those terpenes have been kind of washed off,
[01:25:42.550 --> 01:25:48.070]  you know what I mean? So just because it returns doesn't necessarily mean it should be washed. And
[01:25:49.350 --> 01:25:55.510]  me personally, like, so much fucking work, man. I'm more into, you know, and like,
[01:25:55.510 --> 01:26:04.950]  it's just me personally. I can hear Denver right now. But I like my Drassed, man. I can clean it
[01:26:04.950 --> 01:26:11.270]  up. If I want razzing, I'll smash it. You know what I mean? Simple, simple as that. Nice little,
[01:26:11.270 --> 01:26:17.670]  nice little tumblers and dry ice and shit like that. Shit, man. Make easy money. Fuck yeah,
[01:26:17.670 --> 01:26:26.150]  man. Way easy. I agree. So what do you so do like oily versus sticky, man? You know what I mean?
[01:26:26.150 --> 01:26:31.830]  Like sometimes, you know, some plants are just oily. Some are just sticky. I imagine the sticky
[01:26:31.830 --> 01:26:35.990]  ones are going to be better for hash. What's your experience? Do you breed for sticky? I mean,
[01:26:35.990 --> 01:26:41.990]  does that even factor into it? It just it just kind of works out that way because certain
[01:26:41.990 --> 01:26:47.510]  individuals that we're that we're breeding with are, you know, progeny is typically going to be,
[01:26:47.510 --> 01:26:54.710]  like I said, more that greasy kind of tar type of type of resin. And then other stuff, you know,
[01:26:54.710 --> 01:27:03.910]  you get more of that dry, dry resin, dry, dry stuff with a fat head is generally like what's
[01:27:03.910 --> 01:27:11.270]  what what you're looking for for a dress or something with a head that can break off easy
[01:27:11.270 --> 01:27:20.230]  and not just be a goofy mess. So it's kind of kind of more more desired. But, you know,
[01:27:20.230 --> 01:27:25.110]  like if you look in like old traditional hash, like they do, like in Lebanon and stuff like
[01:27:25.110 --> 01:27:30.710]  that, they just take it and they're just basically given given handies out to the plants, you know,
[01:27:30.710 --> 01:27:37.030]  and then just in that shit off their hands, you know, you get that greasy shit. Yeah, pretty much
[01:27:37.670 --> 01:27:45.270]  like a brand. Yeah, giggity. Yeah, that's why I love hanging out with you,
[01:27:45.270 --> 01:27:48.150]  dude, because you'll ever now and then you'll just throw some shit down there like that
[01:27:48.790 --> 01:27:54.390]  or tell you a little your little stories, you know, you know, you like it, man. You get all
[01:27:54.390 --> 01:28:04.310]  that. You get all the real good ones. Well, I love the TV. That's right. Those are fun to hear, man.
[01:28:05.190 --> 01:28:10.230]  And really, you know, there's a lot of shit that people just don't realize in this from the bad
[01:28:10.230 --> 01:28:15.910]  side. So you're very lucky that most of you are farming right now from a legal standpoint. So,
[01:28:16.470 --> 01:28:21.670]  you know, count your blessings on that and go full force with this and put time and effort into it.
[01:28:22.470 --> 01:28:28.470]  And if you're brand new to this, then like Duke and Marco and myself and everybody that's a part
[01:28:28.470 --> 01:28:35.110]  of this channel, start so slow that you're just focused on a successful flip and then really
[01:28:35.110 --> 01:28:41.110]  start to to understand things like your your goal when you walk down there is to really check the
[01:28:41.110 --> 01:28:46.630]  environment every single day. That should be probably the first thing you know that you got
[01:28:46.630 --> 01:28:50.470]  your especially as you get better at this, you got your little mental checklist and you realize,
[01:28:50.470 --> 01:28:55.510]  all right, I got to do this to that. And it'll be however you kind of it'll be your formula,
[01:28:55.510 --> 01:28:59.910]  your little flow of how you set your thing up. But the environment should be paramount.
[01:29:00.630 --> 01:29:04.150]  And too many people are so focused on trying to make money. And it's like, well,
[01:29:04.870 --> 01:29:10.950]  the yield matters. Yes. When you're doing it successfully. But if you're pumping out stuff,
[01:29:10.950 --> 01:29:14.790]  or you're having a bunch of harms because maybe you are overfeeding or your environment's too bad
[01:29:14.790 --> 01:29:20.390]  when you got powdery mildew. Well, you know, that's those are zero dollars. That's wasted
[01:29:20.390 --> 01:29:24.470]  time and effort. And I promise that happened to a lot of us when we first were getting into this.
[01:29:25.350 --> 01:29:32.950]  We just made a lot of money. Hell, yeah, man, keep it slow, slow. This isn't, you know, there's
[01:29:32.950 --> 01:29:39.990]  there's huge misconceptions, I think, Duke, when you're talking hustling cannabis compared to other
[01:29:39.990 --> 01:29:44.710]  things in life. You know, there is fast money with that stuff. You can't step on cannabis,
[01:29:44.710 --> 01:29:49.670]  right, Marco? No, it's not really a thing where you just keep it going and going. So you got to
[01:29:49.670 --> 01:29:55.030]  put in the time and effort to actually create this kind of stuff. Even before that, before that fish
[01:29:55.030 --> 01:30:00.790]  scale, man, before that fish scale ever got stepped on. It started with farmers growing for years,
[01:30:02.150 --> 01:30:07.350]  a field of cocoa plants. And like, was it like an acre? It's like an acre of the shit or something
[01:30:07.350 --> 01:30:13.830]  goes into one kilo of that shit. You know what I mean? So no wine before it's time. Right. You
[01:30:13.830 --> 01:30:20.310]  know, whether you're brewing beers or wine, like follow your heart and know your basics and, you
[01:30:20.310 --> 01:30:26.230]  know, just try to refine your craft a little bit at a time. Like me, like I just try to get a little
[01:30:26.230 --> 01:30:35.110]  better each time I do it, you know, and that's after goddamn 19, what, 1994. Right. So so now
[01:30:35.110 --> 01:30:42.070]  like I'll be damned if he called me a master grower, I'd laugh in your face and say, you know,
[01:30:42.070 --> 01:30:46.390]  ain't no such thing, man. You can't master this shit. Just try to get a little bit better each
[01:30:46.390 --> 01:30:52.470]  time. That's right. Yeah. Let that for you out there that hear that kind of stuff. I promise
[01:30:52.470 --> 01:30:58.790]  you that person is a fugazi individual if they're using that. Like if granted, if they're, you know,
[01:30:58.790 --> 01:31:03.750]  do they're coming up to stage with some of that stuff? I've heard like the presentation person
[01:31:03.750 --> 01:31:08.630]  say that and then the grower like given that look like, what did you just fucking call me? You know,
[01:31:09.990 --> 01:31:15.990]  but for most of the industry, that's almost a derogatory term. It's somebody that's probably
[01:31:15.990 --> 01:31:21.110]  hacked their way into certain things and now wants the community to thinks that they're a master
[01:31:21.110 --> 01:31:29.110]  grower or a master farmer. That's when you're focused on the wrong. I was a master. I was
[01:31:29.110 --> 01:31:33.990]  a magician, man. I even laughed at that shit. I was like, if there was ever a master electrician,
[01:31:33.990 --> 01:31:37.910]  it was probably like Nikola Tesla. You know what I mean? But even he would be like, yeah,
[01:31:37.910 --> 01:31:45.590]  you ain't mastering this shit. That's right. Y'all said something big. I hit you with the
[01:31:45.590 --> 01:31:49.910]  gold bar, Brian environment, man. If you guys are going to spend some money, spend it on that
[01:31:49.910 --> 01:31:54.790]  environment, dial that environment in. That's going to save you the most headaches from pest
[01:31:54.790 --> 01:32:01.030]  pressure. That's kind of your starting point. You can't even start fighting a pest until
[01:32:01.030 --> 01:32:08.550]  your environment is in a good condition. For me, key one, get that environment dialed in, man.
[01:32:08.550 --> 01:32:15.030]  Hey, look what Ryan just showed me. For us old cats, we definitely didn't have any of this kind
[01:32:15.030 --> 01:32:25.990]  of shit. No, so he's like 82, 70. Nice. Yeah. If you're a younger individual and you understand
[01:32:25.990 --> 01:32:30.870]  technology and you're understanding how to farm cannabis, now you have something where you can,
[01:32:30.870 --> 01:32:34.230]  in real time, I don't even know how you're doing that. What program is that?
[01:32:34.230 --> 01:32:35.270]  It's Trollmaster.
[01:32:35.270 --> 01:32:38.870]  Trollmaster, right? That's what I like about the new generation,
[01:32:38.870 --> 01:32:45.590]  Duke and Marco. These guys understand stuff and probably teach a lot of us how to do a variety of
[01:32:45.590 --> 01:32:54.230]  things. To keep the focal point, I guess, on the grow itself, I don't want people to forget that,
[01:32:54.230 --> 01:32:59.750]  yes, technology is fantastic, but there is no substitution for being in the grow each and every
[01:32:59.750 --> 01:33:06.230]  day. Even if it's your, quote unquote, day off, I still think you need to drive over there if that's
[01:33:06.230 --> 01:33:11.350]  how it is, or run down to your basement and tent and just check on things. That could be a 15-minute
[01:33:11.350 --> 01:33:16.390]  thing, but that should be a daily focus. I think sometimes you get lost in a lot of this technology
[01:33:16.390 --> 01:33:20.310]  or people are pitching it to you when you're first getting into this, like, oh, yeah, you don't even
[01:33:20.310 --> 01:33:25.590]  have to go in your grow for a couple of days. For me personally, when I hear that kind of stuff,
[01:33:25.590 --> 01:33:29.670]  my ears flap over and I don't listen to another word they're saying or try to move on to the next
[01:33:29.670 --> 01:33:35.910]  booth politely. I think it's just some of the worst advice I see and it's still being
[01:33:35.910 --> 01:33:45.110]  spread at some of the larger hydroponic-type expos, that the goal is not to be in the grow room.
[01:33:46.390 --> 01:33:53.670]  Yeah, and they're all tools, right? But there's an old saying, be smarter than the tool you're
[01:33:53.670 --> 01:34:04.550]  working with, right? So, that workspace, knowing why that temperature and that humidity
[01:34:04.550 --> 01:34:10.630]  needs to be where it needs to be, understanding your VPD and everything,
[01:34:11.190 --> 01:34:17.030]  understanding that airflow, and then these tools, they're going to make it easier for you
[01:34:17.030 --> 01:34:23.430]  naturally. You can check it on the phone, that's hella cool, but it's no substitution for the
[01:34:23.430 --> 01:34:29.030]  the best instrumentation we got, and that's our nose and our eyes and everything and being able to
[01:34:29.030 --> 01:34:37.510]  physically see, because like I said, you spot a thrip or a mite or something like that
[01:34:38.390 --> 01:34:43.510]  on the day that you wouldn't have normally gone, you might be able to go ahead and get that settled
[01:34:43.510 --> 01:34:52.310]  real quick versus letting them run amok for two days or whatever. It's always good to,
[01:34:52.310 --> 01:34:57.190]  like I said, at least peep in and go over that first part of your checklist, even if there's
[01:34:57.190 --> 01:35:07.190]  no work to be done, and yeah, it's just good habit. Yeah, or like little things happen,
[01:35:07.190 --> 01:35:13.510]  like somehow a plant got knocked over or like somehow one of the lights blew up, finally ran
[01:35:13.510 --> 01:35:18.790]  out, or there's just like little nuances that you can check that make a dramatic difference,
[01:35:19.350 --> 01:35:22.790]  whether you're growing in your basement, you're growing for somebody else at a larger facility,
[01:35:22.790 --> 01:35:27.510]  and especially if you're growing for yourself at a larger facility, all of those little nuances
[01:35:27.510 --> 01:35:34.470]  add up to making profit at the end of the year or find ways to just kind of move the process a
[01:35:34.470 --> 01:35:41.830]  little bit quicker so eventually you have an extra flip. I think all of that stuff is now
[01:35:41.830 --> 01:35:46.390]  how the industry is dialing in, where we were joking before we even came on the air, back in
[01:35:46.390 --> 01:35:53.430]  the day it was very prideful, I guess, to spend a lot of money on newts, and now it's the exact
[01:35:53.430 --> 01:35:59.350]  opposite. I really like that aspect of where the industry is going as far as individuals that love
[01:36:00.150 --> 01:36:10.470]  building soil system is that it's pennies on the dollar. I don't ever want to feel like I'm cheap.
[01:36:10.470 --> 01:36:19.830]  I like being frugal, but at the same time it's still about quality. If I can make it myself
[01:36:19.830 --> 01:36:24.390]  and we're making it for pennies, just because I'm doing it for pennies doesn't necessarily in this
[01:36:24.390 --> 01:36:30.470]  world mean that it's subpar quality. I think once farmers start to realize that as well, it's like,
[01:36:30.470 --> 01:36:36.950]  well yeah, I'm making it for cheap, but I'm not, for the most part, unless you are spending a ton
[01:36:36.950 --> 01:36:41.830]  of money on nutrients, your work and time and effort is that you're making something that you
[01:36:41.830 --> 01:36:47.270]  couldn't purchase at your local growth store. It's above and beyond. It's far superior, especially
[01:36:47.270 --> 01:36:51.990]  when we're getting into the IMOs and stuff, Marco. That's what I was talking about all weekend.
[01:36:52.550 --> 01:36:56.790]  We got Ryan here that's now doing his own IMOs and stuff and playing around with stuff.
[01:36:57.750 --> 01:37:02.470]  The torch keeps getting passed on that aspect. Duke, I think if you really start to play around
[01:37:02.470 --> 01:37:10.790]  with natural farming, man, and you dive deeper into the jajamp aspects, the future is obviously
[01:37:10.790 --> 01:37:15.430]  bright for you, man, on that. I also think that Marco would love to chop it up with you on that
[01:37:15.430 --> 01:37:19.670]  kind of stuff. Those are two bright minds. I'm always looking to learn more.
[01:37:20.550 --> 01:37:23.030]  You guys could definitely trade. This is good for everybody.
[01:37:23.990 --> 01:37:28.390]  I've got to get you to VA. I'll get you back home.
[01:37:29.990 --> 01:37:34.230]  I'll be there. I'll be there at SkunkCon, whether or not it happens or not. I'll still
[01:37:34.230 --> 01:37:36.150]  come and do it. I know. They pushed it back.
[01:37:37.190 --> 01:37:39.270]  You know how many people ask me to ask you about that?
[01:37:40.630 --> 01:37:42.630]  Yeah, we'll be there. I'm going to be there.
[01:37:42.630 --> 01:37:43.510]  Is that going on?
[01:37:45.670 --> 01:37:47.590]  Yeah, they said mid-November.
[01:37:48.390 --> 01:37:49.350]  Yeah, they moved it back.
[01:37:49.910 --> 01:37:52.310]  Yeah. I'll be there. Like I said, dude, I'm going to be there.
[01:37:52.390 --> 01:37:53.830]  I don't know anything about it.
[01:37:53.830 --> 01:37:54.550]  Regardless.
[01:37:54.550 --> 01:38:00.790]  Yeah, you need to come, Brian. SkunkCon. Gene Trader is putting it on. I'll shoot you a link
[01:38:00.790 --> 01:38:02.630]  on there. Instagram.
[01:38:02.630 --> 01:38:10.550]  Looking for the skunkiest weed, man. The whole crew is showing up, man. Yeah, man. Yeah,
[01:38:10.550 --> 01:38:18.470]  it's going to be cool. My boy, he's got a bunch of farmland up in Hanover. We got a big bonfire,
[01:38:18.470 --> 01:38:24.630]  barbecue, moonshine, the whole works, man. It's going to be a big old thing. So even if they don't
[01:38:24.630 --> 01:38:29.350]  have it, man, I'm still going to do that. We can just all go out there during the day and just do
[01:38:29.350 --> 01:38:29.850]  whatever.
[01:38:30.790 --> 01:38:37.510]  Yeah, shoot me that address. That sounds like some fun right there. Yeah, the best skunk.
[01:38:37.510 --> 01:38:39.190]  You better get your shit together.
[01:38:39.190 --> 01:38:42.470]  Man, I'm like, yeah, Duke's going to be there. You better get your shit together.
[01:38:43.430 --> 01:38:49.510]  Man, I would think the best skunk is probably in your father's closet or shoe drawer or some shit.
[01:38:50.150 --> 01:38:53.750]  A lot of the stuff that a ton of people forgot about that didn't.
[01:38:56.390 --> 01:39:03.830]  I heard Ed Rosenthal talk and a couple of, like Jorge Hervantes and a few others,
[01:39:03.830 --> 01:39:10.790]  and they were saying that from their standpoint, the skunks, the true skunks were being bred so
[01:39:10.870 --> 01:39:17.190]  that that stuff would be eliminated because if you're growing it in your house and it fucking
[01:39:17.190 --> 01:39:21.990]  reeks like that, everybody kind of knows that there's not a million skunks walking around.
[01:39:21.990 --> 01:39:29.190]  So what is that? Is there truth in that? Has everything been watered down in the industry
[01:39:29.190 --> 01:39:32.790]  basically because people were getting caught because it was so skunky?
[01:39:33.750 --> 01:39:43.190]  There was a time where you would see in certain seed menus bred for being low odor as a positive.
[01:39:47.110 --> 01:39:54.230]  I never subscribed to that whole thing, but it was a thing though. It definitely was a thing.
[01:39:55.430 --> 01:40:00.470]  Sour Diesel, man, a lot of people went down because they've grown that plant.
[01:40:00.870 --> 01:40:06.870]  You had to understand, you're growing smelly weed, you need to have extra protocols in place
[01:40:07.430 --> 01:40:13.670]  so it does not get busted. It's not just a carbon scrubber. You need Ona-Gel. You need that shit in
[01:40:13.670 --> 01:40:19.750]  little glass jelly jars and keep them by the windowsills, keep them by any entrance and exit
[01:40:19.750 --> 01:40:25.830]  and everything to add that extra layer of protection. Then don't go running around in
[01:40:25.830 --> 01:40:35.350]  the plant and then go to the store. Don't be stupid. That's a good way to get yourself had.
[01:40:36.870 --> 01:40:42.070]  But that leads back to that reclusive lifestyle. You lived out away from people,
[01:40:42.790 --> 01:40:48.470]  you do your thing, you still keep all those scents down because you never know, man. You
[01:40:48.470 --> 01:40:52.790]  may have Jehovah's Witness come knock on your door. You wait out in the middle of nowhere,
[01:40:52.790 --> 01:40:58.310]  he's trying to tell you about Jesus or whatever. You might have a census worker. You just never
[01:40:58.310 --> 01:41:06.710]  know who might roll up. It's just like that sometimes. So you had to definitely, there's
[01:41:06.710 --> 01:41:11.830]  extra layers of prevention in the smell department if you were going to go that route and
[01:41:12.470 --> 01:41:18.150]  grab a stinky stink. And even with your outdoor, after your outdoor was done,
[01:41:18.950 --> 01:41:23.670]  shit, you're going to be hanging and drying somewhere. So you got to make
[01:41:23.670 --> 01:41:27.590]  sure that shit was kind of off grid and you took that same protocol.
[01:41:30.230 --> 01:41:34.310]  Hey, I learned too from a lawyer when you are living out in the sticks and you don't want
[01:41:34.310 --> 01:41:39.190]  people coming up to your stuff, when you say like no soliciting by law, that doesn't mean shit.
[01:41:39.190 --> 01:41:44.390]  But if you put up a bunch of signs that say no trespassing, I guess by law, that does mean
[01:41:44.390 --> 01:41:48.710]  something. So for you guys that live out there that maybe don't have a few of those signs up,
[01:41:49.510 --> 01:41:54.550]  maybe think about that. And dude always joked about getting a few of those beware of dogs,
[01:41:54.550 --> 01:41:58.230]  even if you don't have a dog, because most people are afraid of getting bit.
[01:42:00.790 --> 01:42:06.550]  No classic was that the trespassers will be shot. Survivors will be shot again.
[01:42:08.310 --> 01:42:09.750]  You see that a lot of Virginia.
[01:42:10.710 --> 01:42:13.270]  Oh yeah. That's a little stand by.
[01:42:15.350 --> 01:42:21.270]  Well, that country living mountain living style where you choose to live like that. So if
[01:42:21.270 --> 01:42:27.590]  somebody is coming at you best believe that they, especially where Georgia, Virginia,
[01:42:27.590 --> 01:42:34.870]  certain aspects of the South, everybody has a few guns within their life length.
[01:42:35.510 --> 01:42:40.310]  Because of that reason, man, because nobody, nobody wants that for their family. So it's
[01:42:40.310 --> 01:42:45.030]  kind of like a nuclear thing, almost like I can end you, you can end me. So let's just be cool
[01:42:45.030 --> 01:42:50.550]  with each other. And I think a lot of that country living is that way where it's just like, I respect
[01:42:50.550 --> 01:42:56.150]  you. I respect your land. Don't fuck with mine. And everything's fine. It's just when idiots like
[01:42:56.150 --> 01:43:01.190]  me, when I was younger, do like Cal tipping and stuff, you know, and the people running out with
[01:43:01.190 --> 01:43:05.190]  the shotgun, thank God. I don't think they were aiming it at us, but they were definitely
[01:43:05.190 --> 01:43:09.830]  fucking shooting it in the air. Makes you run real quick.
[01:43:09.830 --> 01:43:14.310]  Hell yeah, that rock salt burns for fucking days, man.
[01:43:15.270 --> 01:43:19.110]  My dad talks about that to this day, that rock salt when he was a kid.
[01:43:20.230 --> 01:43:21.350]  Stealing watermelons.
[01:43:21.350 --> 01:43:23.510]  Shit fucking burns. Hell yeah, man.
[01:43:24.630 --> 01:43:25.190]  Hell yeah.
[01:43:26.390 --> 01:43:26.950]  Tough, bro.
[01:43:27.910 --> 01:43:33.990]  Mm hmm. Yeah. Another thing we want to touch on with environment, you know, you know,
[01:43:34.710 --> 01:43:39.190]  your body, your body is one of the best instruments. You know, I do have the apps,
[01:43:39.190 --> 01:43:44.870]  the Govee, they monitor and all that. But I walk down into my grow and feel it. You know,
[01:43:44.870 --> 01:43:48.950]  you can know, you know, when that temperature is right, when that environment is good. And
[01:43:48.950 --> 01:43:53.030]  right when I walk down into the grow, I can feel it on my legs, you know, because I go down there
[01:43:53.990 --> 01:43:58.310]  early in the morning with my coffee. And when I feel that coolness on my legs, I'm like,
[01:43:58.310 --> 01:44:04.150]  all right, everything's good. Walking on in and then the thermometers and the humidity is all
[01:44:04.150 --> 01:44:10.070]  matching. We're good to go. So just another little tidbit on the on the environment, you know.
[01:44:11.110 --> 01:44:16.630]  Yeah, man. Like I said, you don't want that muggy, sticky feeling air, you know, you want that,
[01:44:16.630 --> 01:44:19.270]  even though you might be running your humidity up a little bit
[01:44:19.830 --> 01:44:26.790]  higher. Like so like for me, like if I walk outside right now, it's probably like 30%,
[01:44:27.590 --> 01:44:33.590]  you know, maybe even a little lower, definitely dry. So when I walk into a room,
[01:44:34.870 --> 01:44:38.870]  it's gonna feel like a little bit, you know, you know, if I'm running, you know, 60%,
[01:44:39.590 --> 01:44:45.030]  you know, my humidity, it's gonna feel weird when I walk in. But see, I'm looking, I'm looking for
[01:44:45.030 --> 01:44:52.150]  that feel, like you said. But even though, you know, you got it running, but that air circulation
[01:44:52.150 --> 01:44:57.830]  is good. Yeah, it doesn't it doesn't really feel that bad. And you can look at the body language
[01:44:57.830 --> 01:45:01.590]  of those plants, too. They're gonna let you know if they're happy. They're happy. Yeah.
[01:45:03.750 --> 01:45:08.070]  So it's kind of the opposite. You know, it is in Virginia, when we walk out the front door,
[01:45:08.070 --> 01:45:12.790]  you have a sweat rag, you're gonna start sweating. Brian, Brian saw that firsthand,
[01:45:13.270 --> 01:45:17.990]  came out to DC. A little taste of that humidity. It reminded me of growing up in Savannah,
[01:45:17.990 --> 01:45:23.750]  where you take a shower, walk outside. Yeah, everything is dripping. Yeah, you get you get
[01:45:23.750 --> 01:45:29.030]  out the shower, dry off and go outside and you're wet again. You know, you feel gross, man.
[01:45:30.550 --> 01:45:36.150]  And that's the way your plants feel, you know, so definitely small pass, man.
[01:45:36.870 --> 01:45:46.950]  Yeah, I like Colorado for that reason. There's no sweat. Yeah, I mean, it does sometimes suck
[01:45:46.950 --> 01:45:52.070]  in the winter, gets too little too much, but you can walk outside. It feels good.
[01:45:52.630 --> 01:45:57.510]  The thing that got me the most like when I went to Las Vegas, just living out there,
[01:45:57.510 --> 01:46:02.070]  your drink wouldn't condensate. Like in Virginia, you'll get your drink of just
[01:46:02.070 --> 01:46:07.910]  poor water. Yeah, so dry out there. A cold drink with ice won't even condensate on a table.
[01:46:10.870 --> 01:46:17.350]  Yes, it's cool. I just like a year ago here in Vegas. Yeah, we need to go back. Yeah.
[01:46:18.310 --> 01:46:22.150]  Go out there. What are y'all doing, man? Counting cards, high rolling.
[01:46:23.590 --> 01:46:29.430]  Now we ain't counting cards. That shit is tough. They make it they make a movie on it and everybody
[01:46:29.430 --> 01:46:33.670]  thinks they can do that, but I promise you under the lights, rain man, boss and everything.
[01:46:34.310 --> 01:46:41.910]  That shit is not easy. You got to be a borderline genius to handle all the variables of that to be
[01:46:41.910 --> 01:46:47.750]  successful. But I do think time and effort into playing poker, because when you play poker,
[01:46:47.750 --> 01:46:53.990]  you don't play against the house that you can find income for yourself for that. Yeah, especially
[01:46:53.990 --> 01:47:00.950]  like a local casino. Yeah, definitely seen that happen. Make a little side income or
[01:47:00.950 --> 01:47:04.390]  passive income. Just make sure you don't lose the other income. Yeah, but your money
[01:47:05.990 --> 01:47:10.150]  you got to educate yourself for a while before you ever sit down at the table. I think otherwise
[01:47:10.150 --> 01:47:14.870]  you're going to you're going to educate yourself by losing a lot of money. Nobody wants to do that.
[01:47:14.870 --> 01:47:21.430]  That's an expensive education. Yeah, but there's a lot of YouTube channels just like this on the
[01:47:21.430 --> 01:47:29.350]  same subject. I think if you're used to hustling, poker will make a kind of you'll enjoy that
[01:47:29.350 --> 01:47:34.630]  because if you put the time and effort into it, you will be better than others and you will be
[01:47:34.630 --> 01:47:42.310]  rewarded for that because it is a game of skill. I've never played, you know that? It's interesting
[01:47:42.310 --> 01:47:50.790]  to that for you. Never played a game of poker. That's probably good, dude. That's another long
[01:47:50.790 --> 01:47:56.550]  road. Yeah, nobody wants to go down that road unless they really understand what it is.
[01:47:57.590 --> 01:48:03.590]  Yeah, I hate learning shit that cost me a bunch of money to learn. I gotta lose to learn.
[01:48:05.910 --> 01:48:11.030]  Spades and blackjack. There we go. I'll play some spades. Spades is a whole other.
[01:48:12.070 --> 01:48:18.630]  That's a fun game, especially with people that really enjoy hustling and that kind of thing.
[01:48:19.350 --> 01:48:27.030]  Oh, yeah. Talking shit. That's a like. Yeah, some dice. It's hot in the house kind of thing. Let's
[01:48:27.030 --> 01:48:32.310]  play spades on the porch. Yeah, yeah. Lose the amount of money it would have cost to turn on the
[01:48:32.310 --> 01:48:42.710]  AC. If you had an AC. Yeah, that's true. A lot of people don't. Yeah, yeah. You got that. You
[01:48:42.790 --> 01:48:48.070]  ever played dice? Yeah, yeah. Big fat seven, mother fucker.
[01:48:52.070 --> 01:48:55.830]  You get that. It's intimidating, man. It's a young man when they start playing dice in front of you.
[01:48:56.390 --> 01:49:00.870]  Oh, yeah. Did you ever used to take the washcloth and throw it in the freezer and then put it over
[01:49:00.870 --> 01:49:09.350]  the back of the fan? No. He's trying to get a swamp cooler or something. Yeah,
[01:49:09.670 --> 01:49:16.230]  in that biology. I can. The healthy biology in the swamp. I told you, baby,
[01:49:17.430 --> 01:49:22.870]  we were just poor, but like, yeah, yeah. It worked out good, though.
[01:49:24.950 --> 01:49:30.710]  Girl, box fan being poor will allow you to be outside a lot. So that's cool. Yeah,
[01:49:30.710 --> 01:49:36.470]  yeah. We had a clothesline and everything. And the same little wooden clips you hang on the
[01:49:36.470 --> 01:49:41.910]  clothesline where we clip onto the little fan with the little frozen towel and it cool your
[01:49:41.910 --> 01:49:48.790]  ass right off. Man, I still use clothes pins in my grow, man. I just now got my wife got me some
[01:49:48.790 --> 01:49:53.670]  orchid clips because they look a lot cooler. Somebody's giving me a hard time. I still use
[01:49:53.670 --> 01:50:02.390]  clothespins. Yeah, yeah. They look great, man. Hell yeah. Yeah. Aren't you traveling the,
[01:50:02.870 --> 01:50:09.830]  you know, certain areas of Canada? I don't I'm an American. I'm stupid. I was trying to name
[01:50:09.830 --> 01:50:17.910]  two like areas where you are. But yeah, aren't you traveling around, Ken? Vancouver. Yeah,
[01:50:17.910 --> 01:50:23.270]  I'm in North Vancouver today. And then I'm going to be in hope for the weekend at the Mums Cup.
[01:50:23.270 --> 01:50:30.150]  But speaking of sour diesel, Duke, I got New York sour diesel in seed form years ago and I
[01:50:30.710 --> 01:50:36.630]  grew the same strain for two and a half years. And I've got one that's a one year cure and one
[01:50:36.630 --> 01:50:43.510]  that's a year and a half. And when I handed to Kevin Jodry, he sniffed both and he really loved
[01:50:43.510 --> 01:50:50.550]  the one with the one year cure instead of the year and a half. Do you think in the curing that long
[01:50:50.550 --> 01:50:57.110]  that it's going to add the extra flavor or that extra half a year cure? Is that a downside?
[01:50:57.750 --> 01:51:05.830]  Well, most most stuff that that I grow and. Depending on people's growth style, because like
[01:51:06.870 --> 01:51:10.870]  I can grow, say, like some chem dog and that shit's like notorious for like
[01:51:10.870 --> 01:51:16.790]  turning brown, like kind of kind of quick, you know, mine, though, like I keep it cool, dark
[01:51:16.790 --> 01:51:25.750]  place the way I grow. It stays nice, man. I feel like right around like six months. It was like
[01:51:26.150 --> 01:51:32.630]  like the peak of it, you know, and even like keeping it, you know, keeping it put away and
[01:51:32.630 --> 01:51:39.030]  everything that year mark. And like I said, you got to you had to really be in the light
[01:51:39.030 --> 01:51:43.430]  wanting to keep it around or you're growing like a lot of weed. But keeping some weed like that
[01:51:43.430 --> 01:51:49.590]  around for a year mark, it still is just as nice. But it seems to me like right after that point,
[01:51:49.590 --> 01:51:55.110]  like it starts to degrade, you know, even like keeping it put up and everything correctly.
[01:51:56.550 --> 01:52:03.590]  Yeah, it seems to start to fall off pretty, pretty harsh after that, you know, in all regards.
[01:52:07.420 --> 01:52:12.940]  Yeah, that was I think what Kevin was smelling and I've had a few people, they like the smell
[01:52:12.940 --> 01:52:17.980]  of the older one, but the smell of the younger one is a little bit more bite. So they're they're
[01:52:17.980 --> 01:52:25.180]  wanting to enjoy that more than the older one. But I consume by pill form. So I grow a lot of
[01:52:25.180 --> 01:52:31.260]  weed, but I don't consume a lot of weed. So I've got lots just kicking around at home. I people
[01:52:31.260 --> 01:52:39.340]  don't like me for that. No, I got I got a question for you, man. And like apologies to all Canadians
[01:52:39.340 --> 01:52:46.940]  because like for years, you know, the joke was, you know, you get your your milk and bags. And
[01:52:46.940 --> 01:52:50.860]  have you ever encountered a bag of milk in your in your day?
[01:52:52.780 --> 01:52:59.340]  Yeah, yeah. Not generally in the stores in the restaurants. They sell the bags of milk. So
[01:52:59.340 --> 01:53:04.620]  out of the larger dispensers, but yeah, actually used to I was a truck driver and I delivered milk
[01:53:04.620 --> 01:53:11.340]  in Calgary, Alberta. And we'd have the big jugs. You'd see the blue containers everybody loves to
[01:53:11.340 --> 01:53:18.140]  grab. Those would be full with a bag of milk in it. Yeah. Nice, nice. Yeah, it was like that used
[01:53:18.140 --> 01:53:24.220]  to be the thing. And then like karma got my ass because they switched it up, man. I got to them
[01:53:24.220 --> 01:53:32.220]  for a milk up in there. Bra the BOP is doing the bag milk, man. You know, I got tearing off shit
[01:53:32.220 --> 01:53:40.860]  and looking squeezing a bag of milk, orange juice in the bag. No. Yeah, they all are you myself from
[01:53:40.860 --> 01:53:45.420]  the screen because it's your guys's show. So carry on, guys. But loving what you're saying,
[01:53:45.420 --> 01:53:48.300]  do you have a hell of a lot of information, brother? I love it.
[01:53:50.220 --> 01:53:55.100]  Oh, man, thanks. Thanks for answering that for me. Karma got my ass.
[01:53:56.540 --> 01:53:59.820]  As a nasty as bag of milk to know, I should go.
[01:53:59.820 --> 01:54:06.140]  I should. Yeah, rough shit. They had it in the jail.
[01:54:12.700 --> 01:54:17.660]  Do you ever get the chocolate milk in the bag? I want to go. I didn't have a chocolate. I just
[01:54:17.660 --> 01:54:22.620]  had the white. That's anything where it doesn't have to be refrigerated.
[01:54:23.580 --> 01:54:31.580]  No, it's cold. Refrigerate it. Yeah, a little little bag. Yeah. Yeah. It's some thick ass
[01:54:31.580 --> 01:54:38.620]  plastic, too. And I got to go at it. Yeah. He's just stabbed that motherfucker with a fork.
[01:54:39.180 --> 01:54:44.380]  You know, preparation so I can tear it just so because you just tear it with your teeth.
[01:54:44.380 --> 01:54:51.740]  Man, it's all uneven, man. And they get fucked up real quick, man. So people don't want to know
[01:54:51.820 --> 01:54:56.940]  about right. Don't want to know about that life. It's not like I know that life, but I have been
[01:54:56.940 --> 01:55:03.980]  locked up in jail for a few hours. And I know how confined that feels and it's fucked up.
[01:55:04.700 --> 01:55:11.900]  You up in Richmond City? Well, I was in there in my 20s and I spent a night there,
[01:55:11.900 --> 01:55:16.300]  spent a night at Petersburg. I was rowdy, man, when I used to go out when I was young.
[01:55:16.300 --> 01:55:20.220]  I like to mix it up. You take your chain, dude.
[01:55:21.180 --> 01:55:24.220]  These are taking people's chains, putting their shoes up, man.
[01:55:26.060 --> 01:55:29.020]  In Debo style, mother. I'm having a good time, man.
[01:55:30.220 --> 01:55:32.380]  All those Jordans, give me that starter jacket.
[01:55:39.260 --> 01:55:40.060]  Take that shit.
[01:55:40.860 --> 01:55:48.700]  I just didn't like bouncers in the club. I did not. Me and bouncers never saw eye to eye.
[01:55:48.700 --> 01:55:53.500]  So when I go in there, I would I'd be like, find the biggest bouncer and like,
[01:55:53.500 --> 01:55:56.860]  all right, we're going to get it all. If you look at me too much and then
[01:55:56.860 --> 01:56:00.860]  shit, all you got to do. I don't even know if that motherfucker is still open or not.
[01:56:00.860 --> 01:56:06.060]  But club club boss, bro. Boss boss. Thank you. Coppermine.
[01:56:06.700 --> 01:56:09.980]  Coppermine. Yes, sir. I know you tobacco company.
[01:56:11.980 --> 01:56:15.740]  When you want to put a collar on, you want to put a polo on going on the tobacco.
[01:56:15.740 --> 01:56:19.260]  Yeah, yeah. No fake Rolex, man. Go find you a sugar mama.
[01:56:19.260 --> 01:56:22.700]  I'm not sure she'd been had when she shows up at the trailer.
[01:56:24.380 --> 01:56:29.740]  She's not there. Mechanicsville somewhere. Oh, yeah. Nice, man. Nice.
[01:56:30.700 --> 01:56:33.500]  But yeah, be nice to see you, man, in person. Hope they do.
[01:56:33.980 --> 01:56:38.220]  Scott, I'll be cool. And a lot of people are looking for you, obviously. I know you won't be
[01:56:38.220 --> 01:56:43.100]  there. Yeah. So for people that were asking, that's that's now moved to November.
[01:56:43.820 --> 01:56:51.020]  Yeah, I think it was like November 15 and 16 or one of those two days, I think, is when they're
[01:56:51.020 --> 01:56:59.500]  planning on. But, you know, don't don't take my word for it. They might I might be totally wrong.
[01:56:59.500 --> 01:57:06.540]  But regardless, man, I'll be there, you know, no matter no matter what.
[01:57:07.500 --> 01:57:13.580]  Yeah, they had a field. Exactly. They had a date and it was set and they took money and then all
[01:57:13.580 --> 01:57:17.980]  of a sudden out the blue, they gave everybody their money back via PayPal and they set a new
[01:57:17.980 --> 01:57:23.980]  date. So it was November. But I'll find out and shoot it to you. Yeah, it's like somewhere around
[01:57:23.980 --> 01:57:29.340]  like the second week. I remember I remember that part. And the main reason being they wanted the
[01:57:29.340 --> 01:57:35.820]  outdoor guys to be able to have outdoor stocks in there, too. So it's going to be killer. Yeah,
[01:57:35.820 --> 01:57:41.820]  man. Yeah. Yeah. And there's some these girls, some scholar out there outside to fucking.
[01:57:42.460 --> 01:57:48.140]  That's that's going to be a good one. I know them assholes going to be out the parking lot
[01:57:48.140 --> 01:57:57.980]  selling pounds. That's shit, too. Coming up. Yes, sir. I just you want to kind of go over
[01:57:57.980 --> 01:58:03.820]  your new logo and your thought process behind that and that kind of stuff. I know you're
[01:58:03.820 --> 01:58:08.620]  do you mind showing do you have any of that new the new get up stuff or still?
[01:58:09.340 --> 01:58:16.700]  No, not yet. New jobs coming soon. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. My boy, my boy Brad, like we went to
[01:58:16.700 --> 01:58:25.180]  school together back in the day and he's hell of an artist back then. But he he works at River City
[01:58:25.180 --> 01:58:31.020]  tattoo. He don't do tattoos. He literally he just released a new art book or whatever,
[01:58:31.020 --> 01:58:37.900]  and it's called I don't do tattoos. But anyway, he'll draw you shit up. He's outstanding. So
[01:58:37.900 --> 01:58:44.380]  I just gave him a basic like idea and let him run with it because like, you know, his mind just
[01:58:44.380 --> 01:58:50.060]  works different than the rest of the world, you know. So, yeah, he he really outdid himself.
[01:58:50.140 --> 01:58:55.820]  He really did good. Nice. So yeah, yeah.
[01:58:57.260 --> 01:59:02.860]  As for Brad, Brad Douglas, it gets you straight. And it seems like you went with like you
[01:59:02.860 --> 01:59:07.500]  incorporated some of the old school stuff, but maybe have more like some symbolism within this
[01:59:07.500 --> 01:59:14.060]  one or. Oh, yeah. You can't get to hidden shit. OK. Oh, yeah. You get lost up in there, man.
[01:59:14.060 --> 01:59:18.780]  So that was his thought process and stuff. You kind of just said like, hey, I like this idea.
[01:59:18.780 --> 01:59:25.660]  And then he kind of ran with it. Yeah. So let me see some Ed Roth. I want something gritty,
[01:59:25.660 --> 01:59:32.140]  you know, something fucking Richmond gritty. Ed Roth, fucking skunks. Let's go. You know,
[01:59:32.140 --> 01:59:37.900]  and I showed him the old logo and just let him roll with it. Yeah, he's good, man. He's real good.
[01:59:39.900 --> 01:59:45.580]  Yeah. His his Instagram, if you ever want to check out his shit, it's big zoidi,
[01:59:45.580 --> 01:59:53.020]  B.I.G. Z.O.I.D.Y. And check him out. He's he's got some cool shit.
[01:59:55.340 --> 02:00:04.380]  Shit. Yeah, I bet I bet you can probably throw up that. Oh, yeah. Right on.
[02:00:06.380 --> 02:00:12.300]  You'll have to do it yourself. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. I got it. I forgot he sent me a sticker.
[02:00:12.300 --> 02:00:20.860]  Yeah. Nice. Big, zoidi. Yeah. Yeah. Like I said, you need some you need some ink or whatever. Go
[02:00:20.860 --> 02:00:30.060]  over to River City Tattoo. It's off the boulevard in Richmond. And afterwards, get you some buzz
[02:00:30.060 --> 02:00:39.020]  and Ned's barbecue, which is good. There you go. Yeah, I like that, man. Like a good artist. I love
[02:00:39.020 --> 02:00:44.060]  how you can just tell them like with words because, you know, we can't draw. I can't. So I
[02:00:44.060 --> 02:00:48.060]  tell them with words and then when they put that shit down, it's just it's just special. It's like
[02:00:48.060 --> 02:00:54.940]  our guy. Shout out B. Rob designer digital. He's the guy that does a lot of our logos. But that's
[02:00:55.980 --> 02:01:00.460]  he does it hit after hit, you know, like there was somebody in the reptile game that used them,
[02:01:00.460 --> 02:01:05.500]  I guess, because of us. And they were extremely pleased. So yeah, shout out to everybody that
[02:01:05.500 --> 02:01:11.580]  does solid work. I think this is probably the same way, Duke. This gentleman, like, you know,
[02:01:11.580 --> 02:01:17.660]  there's no template for his the way he does his style. So actually draws it out. Yeah. Artists are
[02:01:18.780 --> 02:01:24.300]  different, man. Like their brains are wired up a little different. And God bless them. You know,
[02:01:26.780 --> 02:01:32.220]  it's just really cool to like, like you said, just words even, you know, and then to see what
[02:01:32.220 --> 02:01:40.220]  they come up with. It's mind blowing to me. So do you mind sharing like so, you know,
[02:01:41.580 --> 02:01:45.420]  the thought process with the new logo and moving forward? It seems like you have a lot of that
[02:01:45.420 --> 02:01:50.140]  behind the scenes. I'm sure you'll reveal that in time. But I want the community to know that
[02:01:50.140 --> 02:01:54.860]  it seems like, man, you've really taken the time to think this through and your branding and your
[02:01:54.860 --> 02:02:02.460]  marketing is now like, you know, it's tip top, man. It's first class. And I think, you know,
[02:02:03.500 --> 02:02:07.420]  it's really cool to see that you put the time and effort. I'm sure you've had a lot of time
[02:02:07.420 --> 02:02:12.140]  to think about the way that you want to accomplish things in life. So I want to talk about some of
[02:02:12.140 --> 02:02:16.460]  those things, some of the things, the good things that are going on with you, not only with the
[02:02:16.460 --> 02:02:20.780]  seeds and bringing in that, but you had briefly mentioned that you're working with Jeremy from
[02:02:20.780 --> 02:02:27.580]  Builders Soil and he's creating kind of your own, you know, I don't know exactly how he words it,
[02:02:27.580 --> 02:02:31.820]  but it's kind of like he seems like he works with like the legends of the industry or the
[02:02:31.820 --> 02:02:38.220]  legends of Grow or there's some kind of verbiage. And he seems like he's working with you on the
[02:02:38.220 --> 02:02:44.060]  same level with those other individuals of now coming out with your own soil. So I was hoping
[02:02:44.060 --> 02:02:49.340]  we could kind of dive deeper into that and what you hope to achieve with that with the community.
[02:02:49.420 --> 02:02:53.660]  And if you mind sharing certain aspects of what makes your soil a little bit different than
[02:02:53.660 --> 02:03:03.100]  everybody else. Yeah, for sure, man. The idea struck me probably in like
[02:03:05.740 --> 02:03:14.860]  late 2018 because, you know, everybody's got their own style, right? And, you know,
[02:03:14.860 --> 02:03:21.020]  if I grow weed my way versus another guy growing their way and another gal grows her way and,
[02:03:21.020 --> 02:03:26.300]  you know, we got all these different styles and we'll just take environment like out the
[02:03:26.300 --> 02:03:32.060]  window. We'll just say like we're all like, you know, focused on our environment. Temperature,
[02:03:32.060 --> 02:03:38.540]  humidities are good, air flow is good, everything's cool, but somebody's growing in Peter's Socks,
[02:03:38.540 --> 02:03:43.340]  you know, I'm growing in my soil and my little input. Somebody else is doing a cocoa with some
[02:03:43.660 --> 02:03:51.500]  glucose formula or whatever. Like, you know, you can, and this is without the harvest, the dry,
[02:03:51.500 --> 02:03:56.700]  and the cure part, you know, all that's separate as well, but just the grow itself, you know,
[02:03:56.700 --> 02:04:05.980]  that's a big X factor. Especially you're putting seeds out in the market and you're giving them
[02:04:05.980 --> 02:04:12.460]  expectations on what they can expect as far as a yield rate, smell, flavor, and all these things.
[02:04:14.300 --> 02:04:19.740]  People, you know, that's the biggest X factor of them all, you know. I don't know what medium
[02:04:19.740 --> 02:04:24.780]  they're going to grow on. I don't know if they're a first-time grower or, you know,
[02:04:24.780 --> 02:04:31.500]  long, long time grower, right? So, I thought like it would be because, you know, I like my soil and
[02:04:31.500 --> 02:04:35.660]  I get it. Like, people do their synthetics and like I ain't gonna hate on them at all,
[02:04:35.660 --> 02:04:42.860]  but I can at least say like, hey, if you can have the same environmentals as I do and we both grow
[02:04:42.860 --> 02:04:49.820]  in the same medium and we're both doing the same inputs, our results should be very, very similar,
[02:04:49.820 --> 02:04:57.100]  you know. So, that was number one, and number two was, you know, I'd see a lot of people
[02:04:57.980 --> 02:05:03.580]  getting like Fox Farm soil and they get turned off, you know, because like, oh yeah, I'm doing
[02:05:03.580 --> 02:05:09.500]  my soil thing, but you know, all soils aren't created equal, you know. Then some people get
[02:05:09.500 --> 02:05:13.980]  confused. They buy like a mix that's meant for like starting up some seeds and clones and they're
[02:05:13.980 --> 02:05:19.180]  in there blooming it with water only, you know what I mean? I've seen other people mix up some
[02:05:19.180 --> 02:05:24.220]  gnarly old super soil and they're in there just feeding it to death, you know. Like, they're not,
[02:05:25.740 --> 02:05:31.100]  you know, they're, it's almost like information overload and people overcomplicate and all these
[02:05:31.100 --> 02:05:37.900]  other factors. Like, so I thought, hey, if I can get my mix, which is like done me right for fucking
[02:05:37.900 --> 02:05:43.580]  ever, it's minimal work, minimal input, you don't have to throw it out, like it's a cheaper way to
[02:05:43.580 --> 02:05:49.500]  grow, great results and everything from quality, quantity, the whole works, that would be really
[02:05:49.500 --> 02:05:56.220]  awesome. So, I talked to Jeremy back in the day and I was supposed to talk to him at that
[02:05:57.100 --> 02:06:03.980]  that last Ndendo Expo I saw you at, Brian, and you know, like the man was fixing to be after
[02:06:04.060 --> 02:06:09.980]  my ass, so I had to cut it short. So, when that show was over, I was at the door, so I didn't get
[02:06:09.980 --> 02:06:16.780]  to talk to him further and then when I was away, you know, you got lots of time, you know, so
[02:06:17.340 --> 02:06:23.340]  make best use of your time, you know, plan and, you know, get things, you know, figured out, think of
[02:06:24.140 --> 02:06:29.660]  the different ways of doing stuff and I was like, yeah, it's definitely something that needs to be
[02:06:29.660 --> 02:06:36.860]  done. So, I wrote him a letter and then he wrote me a letter back and he was like, dude, yeah,
[02:06:36.860 --> 02:06:42.620]  I'm all about it and that's what he said, he's like, I'm working with other people in the industry
[02:06:42.620 --> 02:06:48.220]  and we have this like legend series, you know, where they're doing, you know, different inputs
[02:06:48.220 --> 02:06:54.140]  and this and that, he's like, dude, that would be perfect and I was like, cool, because like, you know,
[02:06:54.140 --> 02:06:58.380]  a lot of people, you know, it's weird, right, because like I can take a picture and it looks
[02:06:58.380 --> 02:07:05.740]  all good and shit, but like, yeah, sure, y'all like, you know, I got a real good weed, man, like it is
[02:07:05.740 --> 02:07:14.140]  on point and, you know, they all know that too, so when I get home, you know, I'm writing it all out,
[02:07:14.140 --> 02:07:24.140]  like, hey, here's the mix, you know, based on, you know, a cubic yard, this is what, you know,
[02:07:24.140 --> 02:07:31.500]  I got in there per weight, you know, and per amount and I was like, yeah, like, see what we
[02:07:31.500 --> 02:07:36.940]  can do with this, he's like, all right, well, what I'm gonna do is, I'm gonna mix this up, right, and then
[02:07:36.940 --> 02:07:43.740]  we're going to send it to a lab and we're gonna see what's going on with it, with the levels,
[02:07:43.740 --> 02:07:50.060]  I was like, yeah, because I know it's always done me right, I've never had a lab analysis done on it
[02:07:50.060 --> 02:07:56.460]  because I just never have, so he does it and he's like, yeah, I'm blown away, he's like,
[02:07:56.460 --> 02:08:02.300]  it's like really, really on point for like never, you know, tweaking anything through labs and whatnot,
[02:08:02.300 --> 02:08:07.100]  I was like, yeah, that's great, great to fucking hear, so then we make a few minor adjustments to
[02:08:07.100 --> 02:08:14.140]  get it just right and then we, you know, get a shot off for another lab, comes back, results exactly
[02:08:14.140 --> 02:08:20.860]  where he's wanting to see it, so looking at that, I'm like, yeah, so now you gotta, you know, mix a
[02:08:20.860 --> 02:08:26.940]  batch up, so he mixed up two cubic yards of it for me, send it out and then that's, that's what, you
[02:08:26.940 --> 02:08:34.300]  know, doing our thing and that right now, right, so giving it like a good run out the door
[02:08:34.300 --> 02:08:42.540]  because like there was one thing that we, you know, decided to like switch up was instead of going
[02:08:42.540 --> 02:08:48.700]  with the blood meal, switching it up to a soy amino because like that's a, well, one, like I was
[02:08:48.700 --> 02:08:55.820]  going to input that anyway, but two, it's also like a fast, good nitrogen source, you know, right off the
[02:08:55.820 --> 02:09:04.220]  bat, so, you know, very, very minute change, but, you know, still a change nonetheless, so you gotta
[02:09:04.220 --> 02:09:11.020]  check that out, but, you know, like we're making sure like the soles dose of molybdenum, you know, boron
[02:09:11.020 --> 02:09:19.180]  and a few other things that, you know, you don't typically see, you know, talked about and things
[02:09:19.180 --> 02:09:24.540]  that I felt were like kind of, kind of important to me when I was, you know, really refining my mix years
[02:09:24.540 --> 02:09:33.180]  ago and also like trying to get that soil pH to be like, I said, around that 6.4, 6.5, you know, versus
[02:09:33.180 --> 02:09:38.220]  like a pH neutral and everything, like that was also pretty, pretty big to me as well.
[02:09:38.220 --> 02:09:44.140]  Chris Bounds So if I'm brand new to this system, is this,
[02:09:45.020 --> 02:09:50.460]  you know, is it, you know, I'm adding just a few amendments, is this a water only where it's dialed
[02:09:50.460 --> 02:09:56.300]  in, especially for the beginner, or is this a more advanced soil system?
[02:09:56.300 --> 02:09:59.340]  Chris Bounds I would say like an intermediate, like,
[02:10:00.140 --> 02:10:04.620]  it'd be something, like I am gonna have a couple plants where I just hit it with water only.
[02:10:05.260 --> 02:10:11.100]  I just, I don't know, I just never really recommend that, like, because I don't really
[02:10:12.140 --> 02:10:19.260]  do a whole lot of inputs, you know, but the way I go about it, it's kind of how the cocoa,
[02:10:19.260 --> 02:10:23.980]  the synthetic guys look, and, you know, like a wheat to wheat thing, because there's certain
[02:10:23.980 --> 02:10:29.980]  things in that soil that aren't in my soil, like alfalfa and kelp, like that's something that,
[02:10:30.540 --> 02:10:37.260]  like I want that in my control as an input, you know, so I'm more in like a,
[02:10:37.980 --> 02:10:42.220]  like a wheat to wheat thing, but it's not really a whole lot, you're talking
[02:10:43.820 --> 02:10:47.260]  like a little alfalfa kelp deal at the very beginning,
[02:10:49.020 --> 02:10:55.660]  little earthworm cast in back one OT, a little Epsom salt, or, you know, however you want to do
[02:10:55.660 --> 02:11:03.980]  your magnesium sulfate, and then that's, you know, that's kind of about it. It's not like a
[02:11:03.980 --> 02:11:10.300]  big long list of things to, you know, head in for your input, so, you know, like I said, you could
[02:11:10.300 --> 02:11:16.940]  do probably the water only, but, you know, I'd recommend just put a little extra effort in, and,
[02:11:16.940 --> 02:11:23.500]  you know, get that extra, extra yield and extra, extra smell and all that out of it.
[02:11:24.380 --> 02:11:30.460]  And I think too, like if someone wants to go with your system, hand watering, I think, is paramount,
[02:11:30.460 --> 02:11:35.260]  even if you eventually want to move on to something else, some of those other systems
[02:11:35.260 --> 02:11:44.220]  can cause dramatic, almost like catastrophic levels of like flooding, not only in the room,
[02:11:44.220 --> 02:11:48.940]  but the soil, if you don't understand how it works, or it's not dialed in correctly.
[02:11:49.740 --> 02:11:56.220]  So I think, you know, having somebody like you, man, to have a soil system, and then if you could
[02:11:56.220 --> 02:12:02.620]  just tweak that again real slowly for your environment, again, this might be something
[02:12:02.620 --> 02:12:07.980]  where a lot more people are going to find success, Duke, so, you know, hats off to you in the
[02:12:07.980 --> 02:12:14.300]  Build a Soil platform for, you know, kind of putting out products that, you know, the beginner,
[02:12:14.380 --> 02:12:20.940]  maybe the intermediate farmer can, you know, see immediate results with by just putting a
[02:12:20.940 --> 02:12:26.220]  little more time and effort into understanding their soil systems and where the inputs that
[02:12:26.220 --> 02:12:33.180]  are in those soil systems are coming from. Yeah, man, and like Build a Soil and RootWise,
[02:12:34.380 --> 02:12:41.340]  they're just such awesome people, and Dragonfly Earth Medicine too, because,
[02:12:42.300 --> 02:12:46.140]  you know, there's certain things like, you know, we could just simplify it and be like,
[02:12:46.140 --> 02:12:50.780]  have a little kelp, a little alfalfa do it. If you want to take it up another level, you know,
[02:12:50.780 --> 02:12:57.420]  you could get some radiant green from Dragonfly and brew that up versus that, you know, like,
[02:12:57.420 --> 02:13:05.180]  there's certain levels to it, but overall, at the end of it, it's a pretty damn simple and,
[02:13:05.180 --> 02:13:12.300]  you know, affordable way to do your thing, and it'll give people good success because
[02:13:12.300 --> 02:13:19.180]  I don't want to see people, like, deterred away from organic growing because they got the shit
[02:13:19.180 --> 02:13:25.340]  all fucked up, you know, feeding alfalfa to the end or all the hundreds of other things that they
[02:13:25.340 --> 02:13:31.580]  run into. I want to see people have something affordable. I want to see people have something
[02:13:31.580 --> 02:13:37.420]  simple enough that a beginner can follow, and I want to see people smiling and happy and,
[02:13:37.420 --> 02:13:42.140]  you know, having those good results and, you know, be stoked about growing weed and like,
[02:13:42.140 --> 02:13:47.340]  make weed fucking fun again, you know, and not like such a laborious thing where you're having
[02:13:47.340 --> 02:13:51.900]  to buy all this shit and, you know, and do all this fucking work, like, it's supposed to be a
[02:13:51.900 --> 02:13:57.660]  hobby and like fun and like rewarding and, you know, good medicine for people, like, you know,
[02:13:57.660 --> 02:14:07.020]  like, see people get back to that a little bit more, you know, so I think it's going to be
[02:14:07.020 --> 02:14:13.660]  pretty cool, man, and I'm going to record like a grow by the numbers, you know, in that soil from,
[02:14:14.220 --> 02:14:19.420]  you know, clone and seed start and all the way through the veg and the bloom and the,
[02:14:19.980 --> 02:14:27.180]  you know, the chop and the hang, the dry, the trim, you know, the extended drive, the cure and
[02:14:27.180 --> 02:14:33.980]  everything and, you know, try to spread that, you know, knowledge along, you know, because it goes
[02:14:33.980 --> 02:14:38.140]  a lot of ways to skin the cat, but, you know, I just want to show people like this is how I'm
[02:14:38.140 --> 02:14:42.940]  skinning my cat, you know, you might take one thing out of it, the whole thing might be good
[02:14:42.940 --> 02:14:49.180]  for you, whatever, but at least for new people, I would say like, just stick to these basic things
[02:14:50.380 --> 02:14:55.900]  and you'll get a great result and then if you want to add on to that, at least then you'll have a
[02:14:55.900 --> 02:15:01.420]  baseline, right? So if you do add something that you get better, hey, great, if it gets worse,
[02:15:01.420 --> 02:15:07.980]  then at least you got that baseline of success and say, hey, that didn't work. So are they gonna,
[02:15:07.980 --> 02:15:12.300]  are you guys gonna run this? I know you're running it now, after you run it, is that when it'll
[02:15:12.300 --> 02:15:19.020]  release to the public? Yeah, because Jeremy, he's gonna run some too, but yeah, I'm running it
[02:15:19.580 --> 02:15:27.260]  in a couple of tents and in a big room too, so getting some big, big hoss type plants,
[02:15:27.260 --> 02:15:33.260]  plus some tent size plants and everything and, you know, just making sure, you know what I mean?
[02:15:34.060 --> 02:15:40.860]  Yeah, definitely. Yeah, and I'm growing all my like old usual suspects too, so, you know, I got like a
[02:15:40.860 --> 02:15:45.900]  metric of like, all right, I know what this does, I know what my returns are like, I know what we're
[02:15:45.900 --> 02:15:51.420]  smelling like and yada yada, you know, so after it's all said and done, I have a metric like,
[02:15:51.980 --> 02:15:58.460]  we're still in the same ballpark, right? Or, you know, hey, maybe even a little bit better,
[02:15:58.460 --> 02:16:05.180]  right? But, you know, I don't, you know, it can't be worse. And if for whatever reason I get one,
[02:16:05.180 --> 02:16:11.820]  and then, you know, back to the drawing board, man. Yeah, I commend y'all for that part of it,
[02:16:11.820 --> 02:16:17.500]  man. Because so many people like, they could easily just slap the DD on there, double D,
[02:16:17.500 --> 02:16:22.300]  Duke Diamond and start popping them off, man. But that's much more respect, because
[02:16:22.860 --> 02:16:27.100]  anything could be wrong. One of your ingredients could have been a little off, something could have,
[02:16:27.100 --> 02:16:32.860]  you know, not been quite perfect. And for you guys to do this, man, it makes a lot more business
[02:16:32.860 --> 02:16:38.460]  sense. Because, you know, no need to rush, try to get that money too quick when it could be bad
[02:16:38.780 --> 02:16:45.660]  early. Exactly, man. And like that, the end goal is like happy people with good results and like,
[02:16:46.380 --> 02:16:50.940]  you know, doing their thing, you know, it's not, it's not the money like, yeah, money's cool. Like,
[02:16:50.940 --> 02:16:56.300]  if I can make a little cheddar to spread on this poor cracker, hey, man, I'm cool with that. Like,
[02:16:56.300 --> 02:17:01.740]  you know, I got bills to pay like the next man. But it ain't like, you know, strictly, you know,
[02:17:01.740 --> 02:17:07.180]  just about the about the money, you know, it's, you know, I want to want to see people doing good.
[02:17:07.180 --> 02:17:12.380]  And, you know, if I'm, if I'm growing out, you know, pack some stuff in the same exact soil,
[02:17:12.380 --> 02:17:17.260]  you know, we should be we should be sharing those, those good times, even though you might be in
[02:17:17.260 --> 02:17:23.980]  Australia, Ireland, South Africa, Thailand, Mexico, might be in Virginia, Colorado, where
[02:17:23.980 --> 02:17:28.060]  wherever, you know, we should be able to, you know, sharing that. And that's pretty cool.
[02:17:29.020 --> 02:17:34.140]  You know, he said, money's money's whatever, like, I go get back to doing instrumentation
[02:17:34.140 --> 02:17:39.100]  or something for some some big dollars if I want to get one of these trade shows and stick
[02:17:39.100 --> 02:17:44.700]  up some of these fucking industry jack offs, whatever, strip motherfucker. Let me get that,
[02:17:44.700 --> 02:17:51.100]  you know, but you know, it ain't about that. No, no, no, it's about doing it the right way,
[02:17:51.100 --> 02:17:57.340]  man. Like I was telling somebody that the other day. You know, they were just talking about sales
[02:17:57.340 --> 02:18:01.500]  and stuff like that. And it's not all it's not always about the money. It's about that quality,
[02:18:01.500 --> 02:18:03.980]  get that good quality out and the money's going to come to you.
[02:18:05.180 --> 02:18:10.540]  Hand over. Yeah, man, I want to see people, like I said, growing, growing their own, whether it's
[02:18:10.540 --> 02:18:16.220]  just a recreational thing, like to me, really, I consider all of it medicinal is like, yeah,
[02:18:16.220 --> 02:18:21.020]  you might not be all fucked up, but you know what I mean? Like being in a good headspace and being
[02:18:21.020 --> 02:18:27.340]  happy that it is medicine, you know what I mean? Especially nowadays. So I want to see people
[02:18:27.340 --> 02:18:32.220]  doing good and being successful and having fun and, you know, growing their own because
[02:18:32.860 --> 02:18:37.260]  it's something good, you know, be self-sufficient, you know, grow your own fruits, vegetables,
[02:18:37.260 --> 02:18:42.060]  do it, do it all. You know, it's it's a good way to be save money, get better quality and
[02:18:42.700 --> 02:18:50.540]  it's good. You better. Exactly. Just grow. Yeah, man. Exactly. Dr. Steve Brewer said for your
[02:18:50.540 --> 02:18:59.680]  health. No doubt. All right. Well, you want to kind of but there's going to be a lot more
[02:18:59.680 --> 02:19:06.640]  questions and then I can probably like add some questions to this as well. Ken, are you there?
[02:19:07.840 --> 02:19:13.680]  Yeah, let's run through some. I am here, but a lot of this is getting me stolen,
[02:19:13.680 --> 02:19:16.400]  so I don't know how well I'm going to do today at all. So
[02:19:17.360 --> 02:19:24.960]  look at it. She's the beginning. That's good, man. I'm glad you're smoking like that.
[02:19:25.680 --> 02:19:29.200]  Well, Chris keeps telling me I got to smoke more. So, you know,
[02:19:29.200 --> 02:19:35.200]  London's just been helping out. So, brother, what is your favorite strain?
[02:19:37.520 --> 02:19:45.120]  Well, I can never answer the one favorite one because I got so many different ones for different
[02:19:45.520 --> 02:19:55.600]  things. You know what I mean? So I'll start with I'll start with some daytime, like getting the
[02:19:55.600 --> 02:20:02.560]  getting the day started. Train wreck was always a really awesome one for getting the day started.
[02:20:04.160 --> 02:20:11.360]  I did this one genius phase back in the day like I was like a go to that shit really kept me
[02:20:12.160 --> 02:20:18.400]  kept me going. I'm looking to start feeling a little bit a little bit weird and shit like
[02:20:19.360 --> 02:20:25.360]  a good haze or like super silver haze even. Those were those were always good.
[02:20:26.400 --> 02:20:34.720]  Like this, man. That is those kind of things. Yeah. Yeah. And like they always hit the spot
[02:20:34.720 --> 02:20:43.040]  for me midday. What was it say like a little lunch break had changed, you know, and you got
[02:20:43.040 --> 02:20:51.680]  to get back to work type deal. I mean, like I was I was always partial, like, you know, and I'll stop.
[02:20:55.120 --> 02:21:03.520]  I had all seen 99 cut that I used to like there was a subcool's old Apollo 13 that that particular
[02:21:03.520 --> 02:21:11.360]  coin right there. That was a nice go to later in the evening, man, like, you know, headband. Oh,
[02:21:11.360 --> 02:21:19.600]  geez. They always, always, always kind of kind of hit the spot. And then like a lot of my own work
[02:21:19.600 --> 02:21:27.440]  and start to come into into play there. And just because a lot a lot of the shit that I had was to
[02:21:28.320 --> 02:21:33.920]  more or less like chill out, chill out, you know, relax and everything. And then go on and
[02:21:36.400 --> 02:21:44.080]  yeah. Yeah, exactly, man. So, yeah. So, yeah. A lot of people like, yeah, where's your city?
[02:21:44.080 --> 02:21:51.280]  It was like shit when I worked for Brothers Groom and Sateva out, you know, but a lot of my shit was
[02:21:51.280 --> 02:21:58.880]  like for anti-anxiety, PTSD and good narcotic punch stuff to put you put you down, put you to
[02:21:58.880 --> 02:22:05.920]  sleep, you know, things like that. So, yeah. Hash plants and chem and chem hybrids and stuff like
[02:22:05.920 --> 02:22:12.960]  that always pretty much did the did the trick for me. Well, yeah, you're you're researching for that
[02:22:12.960 --> 02:22:18.720]  time of day when you need that particular strain to cause this effect because that's the pain I'm
[02:22:18.720 --> 02:22:23.600]  feeling or that's the anxiety. And that's that's fantastic. And searching for those strains is part
[02:22:23.600 --> 02:22:32.240]  of the fun. Yeah. Yeah, exactly, man. Like you'll find out what works works best for you. And yeah,
[02:22:32.240 --> 02:22:37.040]  you know, when you find those those ones, you know, like that's that's the good indicator,
[02:22:37.040 --> 02:22:41.440]  you know, your body's not going to lie to you. So, you know, you're going to like that. You
[02:22:41.440 --> 02:22:46.800]  want to keep those clones, you know, and that's how you start to amass, you know, a little mother
[02:22:46.800 --> 02:22:52.640]  collection of things that that work for you, you know, for maybe different different times a day.
[02:22:53.280 --> 02:22:59.600]  And me personally, I would have like multiple things for that time of day. So one day I might be
[02:23:00.160 --> 02:23:04.640]  starting off like this and the next day I start off a different one and then the next day and
[02:23:04.640 --> 02:23:11.280]  then I rotate so I don't get that burnout, you know, all smoking one thing. Yeah, exactly. I kind
[02:23:11.280 --> 02:23:17.440]  of all I've got that I've grown is the sour diesel and I can't smoke anything because I've
[02:23:17.440 --> 02:23:24.720]  got a bad throat that isn't growing in biological situation. The salts kill me. So, yeah, I don't
[02:23:24.720 --> 02:23:29.200]  get really that stoned off of my own stuff anymore because that's all I ever consume. Right?
[02:23:29.920 --> 02:23:36.800]  Yeah. And if you if you switch up that gene pool, you know, you'll you'll just notice you'll get
[02:23:36.960 --> 02:23:44.000]  high school high again because you're I would love that. Yeah, I would love that. I'm a thousand
[02:23:44.000 --> 02:23:51.120]  fifty milligrams a day. So it takes something pretty special to get me high at all. I've given
[02:23:51.120 --> 02:23:57.840]  you a ton of variety. I've given him a ton of variety. I'm not coming on screen because I have
[02:23:57.840 --> 02:24:07.040]  no shirt on. It'd be weird. I do it. I appreciate it. So I we we were at the Unicorn Cup. We probably
[02:24:07.040 --> 02:24:11.680]  went through about 30 different varieties in flower form, at least in about 12 or 14 different
[02:24:11.680 --> 02:24:18.160]  varieties, at least of of rosins and different flavor profiles. And one thing that I noticed
[02:24:18.160 --> 02:24:23.200]  with Kenny's, he leans on those heavy turpentine gas, heavy sedative, dominant ones. And those are
[02:24:23.200 --> 02:24:28.480]  usually where I see him have the most success with dealing with his own personal pain and dealing
[02:24:28.480 --> 02:24:33.040]  with that type of thing. Like when I see him kick one of those, I always see a positive response.
[02:24:33.040 --> 02:24:37.760]  But there isn't there. There isn't a lot that actually gets it gets him good. So I'm always
[02:24:37.760 --> 02:24:42.320]  excited when I find something he's like, damn, that's fine. No, sure. London's no shirt. Jesus.
[02:24:42.320 --> 02:24:48.480]  Thanks. I appreciate that. Yeah, they may have that super chat thing. They might start throwing
[02:24:48.480 --> 02:24:59.680]  dollars at you, man. Yeah, no man boobs, London. That's what Jeff's saying. But anyway, we'll go
[02:24:59.680 --> 02:25:08.240]  the next question. Does Duke know anything about Julius going around northeast in mid 2000s tasted
[02:25:08.240 --> 02:25:16.640]  like an orange Julius from the mall? Man, I don't. But during during that time frame,
[02:25:17.280 --> 02:25:25.600]  your big oranges would have been, you know, somebody growing Calio or Eric 77 Calio or
[02:25:26.480 --> 02:25:37.760]  a hybrid of let's see here. They say to close the years 2004 to five early to start. Yeah.
[02:25:39.440 --> 02:25:48.240]  Let's see, because Jilly Bean came around and like late. Oh, four, I believe. So,
[02:25:49.040 --> 02:25:54.720]  you know, something off of that maybe. But I would suspect is probably somebody rocking out
[02:25:54.720 --> 02:26:03.840]  that old Calio. Okay, cool. So and that is the California orange, but is how it was first. Yeah.
[02:26:05.600 --> 02:26:14.960]  Yeah. Well, that's Jilly Beans. Nostalgic. That takes you back to that is. And see, I got to go
[02:26:14.960 --> 02:26:19.280]  back into the 80s for anything that tastes like what I used to smoke because then I quit for 20
[02:26:19.280 --> 02:26:27.120]  years. So I got to go back to tie stick and, you know, the old strings from gold. Yeah, yeah,
[02:26:27.120 --> 02:26:35.040]  exactly. Yeah. The tie stick dipped in fucking opium and shit. Yeah. That's why they don't hit
[02:26:35.040 --> 02:26:40.880]  the same for you, buddy. Angel dust, you know, a little bit of angel dust in the bad weed. Hey,
[02:26:40.880 --> 02:26:46.880]  man, this is premium stuff now, man. Some love boat. Yeah. Duke, where is the sour?
[02:26:47.120 --> 02:26:52.560]  More. Oh, sorry, Marco. Would you say, right? No love boat. I was a fucking formaldehyde.
[02:26:53.440 --> 02:27:00.640]  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So anyway, the sour these to come to Richard,
[02:27:02.800 --> 02:27:10.800]  where has it been? A Richmond. Sorry. I got locked up in seven. So it was probably a drought from
[02:27:10.800 --> 02:27:21.120]  then on. Pretty heavy. We were blowing up all over the place. Yeah. So let's see, Duke. I'm
[02:27:21.120 --> 02:27:28.240]  smoking on the Thunder Hole this morning. My girl has already benefited from your advice on kelp and
[02:27:28.240 --> 02:27:35.840]  elf alpha. When is the book release? As soon as I get as soon as I get some more time, like I
[02:27:35.920 --> 02:27:42.960]  haven't had time since I was locked up. Right. You got lots of time when you're on the inside,
[02:27:42.960 --> 02:27:48.960]  you get out and you got your busy again. Yeah. Especially catching up for two years. You know,
[02:27:48.960 --> 02:27:56.640]  like there's a lot of a lot of shit to do. Oh, I guess. So what's your favorite dominion strain?
[02:27:57.200 --> 02:28:06.720]  Depends once again, like what what for? I would say like for my like my anxiety and chilling
[02:28:07.760 --> 02:28:17.120]  screaming eagle purple Dahlia were like really good for that on my not like going to sleep like
[02:28:17.120 --> 02:28:23.920]  but, you know, chilling, but definitely stoned as shit. The hoodoo and skunk band were were
[02:28:24.080 --> 02:28:28.960]  definitely up there. Then I started to kind of dwindle into the more heavy,
[02:28:30.080 --> 02:28:39.760]  heavy narcotic type type weeds, you know. So. OK. Yeah. Yeah. Dominion G was a was a hell of a
[02:28:39.760 --> 02:28:46.960]  hell of a strong one. The burnout was pretty, pretty damn strong to the beefcake. They used to
[02:28:47.520 --> 02:28:54.320]  the beefcake. They used to swamp me kind of in between the two. You know, there was there's
[02:28:55.120 --> 02:29:01.360]  and to to make a list, because like I said, I always keep like a rotation, you know, so I don't
[02:29:01.360 --> 02:29:07.280]  I don't catch that burnout. Yeah. If you're if you're like a husband, wife team and you're
[02:29:07.280 --> 02:29:12.400]  growing, I think that purple Dahlia is is something that you should do. So are you still
[02:29:13.200 --> 02:29:19.120]  producing that one or is that one retired? No, no, that one's that one's retired off. But
[02:29:20.800 --> 02:29:26.960]  I do have something in the works up in that ante a little little bit more.
[02:29:29.440 --> 02:29:34.320]  Because everything that one was beautiful to work in progress. Yeah. Yeah. Pretty shit to
[02:29:35.200 --> 02:29:42.720]  I can smell the flavor, the stone on it was just outstanding. Sounds good. Because when you're
[02:29:42.720 --> 02:29:46.720]  farming, you got to remember to who are you farming for? Like you can't always be farming
[02:29:46.720 --> 02:29:52.160]  for yourself if you're in the commercial aspect. So to have something that kind of is stony, but
[02:29:52.160 --> 02:29:56.480]  also really is that has that like purpleness to it and also has that glitter and shine,
[02:29:57.040 --> 02:30:01.680]  you know, that's the average person is going to look at that and want to look at the purple one.
[02:30:01.840 --> 02:30:06.240]  I promise you, if they've never seen that before. So it's just like it's more eyeballs on your
[02:30:06.240 --> 02:30:11.280]  product as well. So remember, you know, genetics matter with this kind of stuff. And that's why we
[02:30:11.280 --> 02:30:16.960]  go out of our way to have people that are, you know, legendary individuals with with understand
[02:30:16.960 --> 02:30:21.600]  how to do this stuff so that you guys can take the time. You put three hours into us each and
[02:30:21.600 --> 02:30:27.520]  every week so that you can minimize probably months and years of just heartache or growing
[02:30:27.520 --> 02:30:33.680]  subpar genetics that are maybe a little too hyped that, you know, nobody really talks about it.
[02:30:34.400 --> 02:30:38.160]  I had a friend that was talking Duke that was kind of like, you know, it's the headline,
[02:30:38.160 --> 02:30:41.680]  you know, some of these breeders are the headline. So everybody's reading the headline.
[02:30:41.680 --> 02:30:46.320]  And then in the, you know, page seven, a few weeks later, they should be coming out being like,
[02:30:46.320 --> 02:30:51.040]  oh, man, everything her and when they do come out with that, nobody reads that headline anymore,
[02:30:51.040 --> 02:30:55.200]  because it's buried in a bunch of other stuff. So do you feel like that's a pretty good analogy?
[02:30:55.200 --> 02:31:01.120]  And it does kind of seem like if you're not paying attention, you can get a bamboozled pretty easily.
[02:31:01.840 --> 02:31:07.760]  That things move so fast, you know, it's that they're looking to put the next best thing in
[02:31:07.760 --> 02:31:12.880]  front of you. By the time it's grown out, they've already had like another drop or two in between.
[02:31:13.760 --> 02:31:19.360]  And yeah, it's just it's like a never ending cycle. And it might not be necessarily the same
[02:31:20.160 --> 02:31:25.040]  place. You know, it's just another person riding another wave or riding on the same person's waves.
[02:31:25.200 --> 02:31:31.680]  So it's just nonstop, nonstop. And eventually, like, you know, they're only going to pull that
[02:31:31.680 --> 02:31:36.880]  off like, you know, once, maybe twice with the same people. And then they're looking to kind of
[02:31:36.880 --> 02:31:42.960]  drift away. But as things are like continuing to grow and legalization becomes, you know,
[02:31:42.960 --> 02:31:50.720]  it's growing more and more. You get more and more new people. And, you know, they're fresh,
[02:31:51.200 --> 02:31:57.600]  fresh fish, man, ready to get got. So that's what I'm saying. Like, if you knew or you got somebody
[02:31:57.600 --> 02:32:03.360]  else looking, you know, to start with you or whatever, always give them give them that advice,
[02:32:03.360 --> 02:32:09.280]  you know, when they're looking to grow something new. Some do their homework, make sure the test
[02:32:09.280 --> 02:32:17.280]  in the shit out, at least. The thing is, with the newest of the new, like you said, by the time that
[02:32:17.280 --> 02:32:24.400]  next headline comes out, there's already been a bunch more drops in between. So it's as fresh,
[02:32:24.400 --> 02:32:30.800]  newest of the new. There aren't any reports on other people growing it, right? So you don't
[02:32:30.800 --> 02:32:38.160]  have that input. But at minimum, at least they should be able to, you know, show like, hey,
[02:32:38.160 --> 02:32:44.320]  you know, they've been growing it, running it through the numbers. And, you know, it's something
[02:32:44.320 --> 02:32:49.440]  quality at the at the end of it. And maybe, you know, throwing those tidbits out there saying,
[02:32:49.440 --> 02:32:54.320]  like, yeah, it's like it's all sensitive to overfeeding. You know what I mean? So,
[02:32:54.880 --> 02:32:58.960]  you know, if you're growing this way, you know, keep your keep your feeds like this, you know.
[02:33:00.800 --> 02:33:06.240]  Otherwise, you're good times are ruined. You know, it's always good to have that data,
[02:33:07.040 --> 02:33:08.080]  data for the grower.
[02:33:10.800 --> 02:33:15.920]  Yeah, I think behind the curtain, sometimes when people are like, oh, yeah, this has been tested.
[02:33:17.280 --> 02:33:22.880]  You know, I don't know how to word this the right way. But sometimes it's not it's it's not tested
[02:33:22.880 --> 02:33:27.440]  by individuals that are maybe even newer to growing and stuff like it's like, yeah, people
[02:33:27.440 --> 02:33:32.800]  have grown it, but it wasn't necessarily like, how do you know it's its full genetic profile? And
[02:33:32.800 --> 02:33:37.920]  I think there's some breeders that that are okay with that. It's like they just want to put out,
[02:33:37.920 --> 02:33:44.960]  you know, 30 different varieties every quarter, however they view view it. And they're so focused
[02:33:44.960 --> 02:33:53.440]  on the different varieties, the steady genetics for the average person. It seems like some guys
[02:33:53.440 --> 02:34:00.560]  just don't really give a fuck about that. And it's sad to see because I don't know, man, I think I
[02:34:00.560 --> 02:34:05.440]  should let somebody because I don't want to say the wrong thing here. But the focus should be
[02:34:05.440 --> 02:34:11.280]  really on putting out your work like if you if that's your this is your art form, then your
[02:34:11.280 --> 02:34:17.280]  artwork should be fire. You should be something that you're proud of. And right. Every time everybody
[02:34:17.280 --> 02:34:22.320]  view that way. Like my name's got to be on it. And like my name is like, it's worth something,
[02:34:22.320 --> 02:34:27.760]  you know, so this tells me like, the name ain't shit, you know what I mean? And they just they
[02:34:27.760 --> 02:34:33.200]  will swap that out for a quick buck. And, hey, you know, they they got their bills to pay or
[02:34:33.200 --> 02:34:39.040]  whatever. I ain't paying them so they can do them. But, you know, they don't they don't last for long.
[02:34:39.040 --> 02:34:47.200]  You know, you'll see them. They come and they go all the time. It's the Instagram weed. Yeah.
[02:34:47.200 --> 02:34:53.440]  Yeah. It's quick. It's up. It's down. You know what I mean? Like, yeah, it's it's it
[02:34:54.000 --> 02:34:59.440]  like purple. Good example where he's saying Instagram weed. Right. Like,
[02:35:01.040 --> 02:35:06.000]  no one smoked it yet, but everybody's on the hype train because of the way I looked, I guess.
[02:35:06.800 --> 02:35:14.960]  But it was purple. No punch. It was purple. And like a good example would be like, let's say you
[02:35:14.960 --> 02:35:19.920]  were, you know, you're doing your Instagram thing. You see a guy's like, oh, yeah, I got this purple
[02:35:19.920 --> 02:35:27.360]  punch going. It's January. Right. And then the dude's got a seed drop in May from Purple Punch
[02:35:27.360 --> 02:35:35.120]  selling it. I mean, you do the math like he had enough time to vegetarian, hit it with some pollen,
[02:35:36.240 --> 02:35:41.280]  half ass, draw some seeds out, put them in packs and start selling them. That's as you're right
[02:35:41.280 --> 02:35:49.120]  there like a like, you know, that math don't add up that actually like like doing those practices
[02:35:49.120 --> 02:35:54.720]  actually hurt our industry and our community way worse than people realize, because when you put
[02:35:54.720 --> 02:36:00.720]  out the genetics to that hasn't been tested and it gets in the hands of people that aren't
[02:36:00.720 --> 02:36:06.560]  experienced, right, they're going to grow that, you know, this is breeder X's, you know, seed,
[02:36:06.560 --> 02:36:10.160]  right. They're going to grow that and then the hype's going to be behind it. And then they're
[02:36:10.160 --> 02:36:15.120]  going to get ahead of themselves. You know, they're going to think that just because that name's tagged
[02:36:15.120 --> 02:36:21.600]  onto it, they can go ahead and work it or sell a clone or and if they sell that clone and maybe
[02:36:21.600 --> 02:36:26.160]  someone takes that and now breeds with it. Now, the genetics are stable. So you kind of could be
[02:36:26.720 --> 02:36:32.000]  set back in your in your breeding program if you add some genetics like that to your stuff. So,
[02:36:32.960 --> 02:36:36.400]  you know, that's why I just feel like, man, don't put the money over quality,
[02:36:36.400 --> 02:36:40.480]  you know, and that goes for each stage of this. That's going to make our whole industry stronger.
[02:36:41.440 --> 02:36:48.080]  Yeah. And at the end of it, like somebody might not even like realize like it wasn't it wasn't
[02:36:48.080 --> 02:36:53.520]  them because like you see it go both ways. Like I've seen people complain about, you know, genetics,
[02:36:53.520 --> 02:36:57.920]  but they're just total shit growers. You know, I've seen it go that way. And I've seen people
[02:36:57.920 --> 02:37:03.520]  do nothing wrong and end up with the whole whole pack of herbs and everything and don't even realize
[02:37:03.520 --> 02:37:07.920]  that, you know, it wasn't something they've done. I've seen both ends of the spectrum,
[02:37:07.920 --> 02:37:13.840]  everything in between. And, you know, like the new people, like I said, it might deter them away
[02:37:13.840 --> 02:37:21.600]  from growing. Right. And that, you know, that's not cool either. But yeah, like it can put a it
[02:37:21.600 --> 02:37:29.840]  can definitely put a put a bad, bad rap out there for sure. Like I used to say, it's like a CD
[02:37:29.840 --> 02:37:36.800]  industry, you know, and people, they're looking to get paid, you know, versus, you know, quality
[02:37:36.800 --> 02:37:43.280]  and being out there for the for the long haul. I run a run at a, you know, take pride in your work.
[02:37:43.920 --> 02:37:48.720]  You know, that's what you do. And that's what a lot of the breeders are doing is taking pride.
[02:37:48.720 --> 02:37:53.600]  But yeah, there's some guys that are more scam artists than grower, and they're just in it for
[02:37:53.600 --> 02:37:59.600]  the money. And that's that's the hard part of the business. Yeah. And it's so prevalent, you know,
[02:37:59.840 --> 02:38:07.440]  um, you know, it's just hard to weed through it all, because the problem is, you'll see some of
[02:38:07.440 --> 02:38:13.120]  the newer cats that are doing their thing and just now coming out, and they are putting in the work
[02:38:13.120 --> 02:38:19.520]  and they are doing a good job. But they're they're they're whole thing is ruined by the other 10 guys
[02:38:19.520 --> 02:38:24.800]  that aren't there fly by night seed company. They're fucking people's gardens up, and it ruins
[02:38:24.880 --> 02:38:32.160]  it for that other new person, you know, so then people only stick to, you know, places that have
[02:38:32.160 --> 02:38:37.760]  been in business for like a long time and have that good track record, you know, it's kind of,
[02:38:37.760 --> 02:38:44.960]  it's kind of sad. And in that regard, but, you know, once again, you know, just do do the homework
[02:38:44.960 --> 02:38:50.400]  on it. And, you know, look at, you know, there might be a new person, but just look at what
[02:38:50.400 --> 02:38:55.520]  they're doing, you know, um, you know, if they're in there, you know, doing their thing, and,
[02:38:55.520 --> 02:39:00.800]  you know, they're testing everything out and, you know, putting the putting the info out there and
[02:39:00.800 --> 02:39:06.080]  all like that, that's a good thing. You do you see it very often? No, no, you don't. But sometimes
[02:39:06.080 --> 02:39:12.480]  you do. And I'd be a damn shame that people overlook somebody who's who's newer into into
[02:39:12.480 --> 02:39:16.960]  doing their thing. They might have been growing for 30 years, and maybe even doing their own
[02:39:17.760 --> 02:39:23.440]  little, you know, breeding, you know, just just for their own well being. And now they're,
[02:39:23.440 --> 02:39:29.920]  you know, opening up to a public, you know, so yeah, you know, you just gotta kind of take it
[02:39:29.920 --> 02:39:37.360]  case by case and really, really look at look at what's going on. Yeah, exactly. Because each person
[02:39:37.360 --> 02:39:41.600]  is different. Each person has a different attitude. And it's the attitude that really makes the
[02:39:41.600 --> 02:39:47.920]  breeder when it comes down to it. Is that end game that they have? But Duke, are you still
[02:39:47.920 --> 02:39:56.240]  going to be working with Soul Fire Gardens? Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's, um, right now we're just at a,
[02:39:57.440 --> 02:40:03.840]  it's just like, at a catch up type phase, you know, because being away for a couple years,
[02:40:04.880 --> 02:40:10.720]  I've always tried to keep things a couple, couple years ahead. So that's, that's definitely going to
[02:40:10.720 --> 02:40:16.480]  help me out, but still playing a little bit of catch up. And then I'm gonna start getting with
[02:40:16.480 --> 02:40:23.920]  everybody and making some making some cool, cool little deals with with other, other friends and
[02:40:23.920 --> 02:40:29.760]  everything. I think everybody I really, really be happy about. All right, on that kind of bleeds
[02:40:29.760 --> 02:40:38.080]  into this question. Is the diamond blend out? Now? Not yet. Not till I give it the the two,
[02:40:38.080 --> 02:40:44.320]  the two thumbs up, you know, it's, uh, like I said, it's gotta gotta do it. Said it was like,
[02:40:44.320 --> 02:40:50.160]  it's a very small change, right? But it is, it is a change. And even if I didn't make any,
[02:40:50.800 --> 02:40:56.000]  any changes to the old, the old recipe, like at all, I would still run through it because,
[02:40:56.720 --> 02:41:01.120]  you know, I love Jeremy and I know like he's a straight up, he's an awesome guy, but
[02:41:01.680 --> 02:41:07.440]  I did not have a shovel and a rake, you know, mixing everything and doing it, you know, so
[02:41:08.160 --> 02:41:13.120]  just, you know, it's just I am I gotta I gotta test everything and make sure everybody's gonna be
[02:41:13.680 --> 02:41:19.600]  be happy with it, you know, so soon as soon as I get a run through and everything and
[02:41:19.600 --> 02:41:22.080]  everything's cool, then yeah, we'll let it roll.
[02:41:24.000 --> 02:41:29.760]  All right on and that's good. Everybody's gonna be looking forward to that. So somebody was asking,
[02:41:29.760 --> 02:41:33.680]  when you're coming to Maine cheddar Bob's living in Maine now he wants you to come visit.
[02:41:34.560 --> 02:41:42.320]  Oh, that's what's up man. The gunshot wound is healed up good. Remember that movie?
[02:41:43.280 --> 02:41:51.520]  Yep. Anyway, it'll be after it'd be after I'm off of paper, which would be
[02:41:53.120 --> 02:41:57.760]  right around New Year's. And then I'm gonna wait for y'all to thaw out a little bit.
[02:41:58.160 --> 02:42:03.200]  And then come up, come up see how it gets cold as a motherfucker up there.
[02:42:04.000 --> 02:42:08.720]  I used to hang around East Corinth and banger and all that back in the day.
[02:42:09.520 --> 02:42:14.960]  And I'm from Northern Canada. So Maine is nice and toasty warm in the wintertime compared to here.
[02:42:15.600 --> 02:42:21.520]  Oh, man. Sure. Lord, man. Don't ever go to Virginia in the summer, buddy. You melt.
[02:42:22.240 --> 02:42:29.200]  Oh, exactly. Right. So let's see. Crackerjack control station. A good, okay. I think,
[02:42:29.200 --> 02:42:33.120]  I think I put that in and I wasn't supposed to. So we'll get rid of that.
[02:42:35.760 --> 02:42:39.200]  Fruity pebbles. Can we talk about fruity pebble? Oh, gee.
[02:42:40.560 --> 02:42:49.360]  Yeah, it was from a buddy obsolete back in the day. I don't know if he still works with it or not,
[02:42:49.360 --> 02:42:59.760]  but check out his company. It's called Franchise Genetics. Check them out. It's obsolete.
[02:42:59.760 --> 02:43:07.760]  Is the name I forgot his Instagram, man. But it's like OBSOULEET.
[02:43:10.160 --> 02:43:16.800]  But yeah, yeah, check them out and ask, ask him what's up. He might still be doing stuff with it.
[02:43:16.880 --> 02:43:23.600]  Yeah, he does. He does. Nice, nice work. All right on. So then people are wondering,
[02:43:24.160 --> 02:43:28.320]  some of us avoid Instagram. When is your website and forum dropping?
[02:43:29.840 --> 02:43:40.640]  So instead of the forum, we set up a discord, right? And it's very forum like, and also like
[02:43:40.640 --> 02:43:49.360]  there's a like a voice chat feature. And like we do, we do a thing every, every Friday night,
[02:43:49.360 --> 02:43:56.080]  me and an old friend of mine. And everybody just kind of gets in there and just shoots the shit.
[02:43:56.080 --> 02:44:04.000]  Like it's a lot of, a lot of good times. Got a lot of, a lot of cool people. People that used to be
[02:44:04.000 --> 02:44:09.920]  on forums way back that hate Instagram and shit. They even hate the forums now and they're up in
[02:44:09.920 --> 02:44:15.840]  there. There's a wealth of knowledge in there from people that just go under weird little aliases.
[02:44:15.840 --> 02:44:22.160]  So people don't hound them for clones and shit like that. But we do a Friday night seed giveaway
[02:44:22.160 --> 02:44:31.840]  and everything else. If you were to go on my YouTube channel or my Instagram. So on the Instagram,
[02:44:31.840 --> 02:44:37.120]  on that main header page, there's a little link. It says linktree. If you click on the linktree,
[02:44:37.680 --> 02:44:46.160]  that's going to give you a link to the discord or to the YouTube channel. Websites coming up
[02:44:47.040 --> 02:44:53.520]  ish, you know, soon, but I highly recommend the discord. I think y'all would have a real good time.
[02:44:53.520 --> 02:44:59.840]  It's a real laid back community of people. It's my house too. So, you know, if anybody's up in
[02:44:59.840 --> 02:45:04.640]  there on some bullshit or some dickhead shit, man, they get booted the fuck out real quick.
[02:45:04.880 --> 02:45:13.280]  So it's all cool, laid back people. It's just lots of good sharing information. I think everybody
[02:45:13.280 --> 02:45:20.720]  will really, really like it. You know, just the only thing is like when you make a discord account
[02:45:20.720 --> 02:45:26.640]  and you click that link, you know, that puts you in the server. It'll take you to a little verify
[02:45:26.640 --> 02:45:32.720]  channel. I throw some people off, but it is just say, it just says like the rules, you know,
[02:45:32.720 --> 02:45:39.440]  it's like no drama, no politics, no annoying shit. If you're cool with that, there's a little
[02:45:39.440 --> 02:45:46.160]  thumbs up little icon and you just click that and then you're verified and you run them up.
[02:45:47.440 --> 02:45:52.720]  That's it. All right on. Yeah. I haven't been on discord yet. I know lots of people are talking
[02:45:52.720 --> 02:45:58.800]  about it. I just, I'm on too much social media as is most, most days for what I figure anyway.
[02:45:59.600 --> 02:46:05.600]  Yeah. It's, it's nice, man. Like it's easier to keep up with people, messages and everything.
[02:46:05.600 --> 02:46:12.640]  And also like how a forum would be like a lot of different topics, you know, and stuff, you know,
[02:46:12.640 --> 02:46:18.960]  more specifically to what you're, what you're looking to looking to do. So I guess everything
[02:46:18.960 --> 02:46:24.640]  from auctions and giveaways and C drops of the whole works, you know, and it's just,
[02:46:24.640 --> 02:46:29.760]  it's just good times and good people, you know? Oh, and that's what makes it all the difference
[02:46:29.760 --> 02:46:35.840]  is those good people that are there too. So rusty nails is asking about canopy management.
[02:46:36.560 --> 02:46:47.200]  Yeah. So what, what you're looking for. All right. Let me see how to, how to, how to want this up
[02:46:47.280 --> 02:46:55.680]  here. So height is, is definitely a big part of it. And assuming, like I said, you can keep
[02:46:55.680 --> 02:47:02.240]  temperature and humidity good in this, in this area and the light intensity on this canopy.
[02:47:02.800 --> 02:47:07.840]  All right. Now, as far as the management of the canopy itself, whether you're using
[02:47:09.600 --> 02:47:16.240]  like a netting, you know, like you're, you're doing a like a scrub netting. Yep. If you're
[02:47:16.240 --> 02:47:25.280]  doing that, or maybe you're doing a staking stuff like that. That when we were talking about
[02:47:26.000 --> 02:47:32.800]  seeing the best shape of a plant, right. So, you know, on the traditional shape, you know,
[02:47:32.800 --> 02:47:38.640]  we had a nice, you know, nice color or whatever that grew up. We top it, you know, on the clone
[02:47:38.640 --> 02:47:45.120]  run. And then we have like a multi-top deal on, you know, on another clone. And we see that like,
[02:47:45.120 --> 02:47:52.000]  whether it was topped or multi-topped, like it was the same big cola, but times 10 or whatever.
[02:47:52.640 --> 02:48:01.120]  So assuming we can do that, the idea is trying to keep everything like on the, on the, you know,
[02:48:01.120 --> 02:48:07.200]  give or take, cause it's hard to get them, you know, exactly perfect and level, but keeping
[02:48:07.200 --> 02:48:12.960]  everybody at the, at the same height. And what that might involve you doing is a little bit of,
[02:48:12.960 --> 02:48:17.760]  a little bit of stem crushing and stuff to hold something back. So everything else catches up,
[02:48:18.720 --> 02:48:25.680]  or you can do like low stress training where you take, you know, a piece of like, you know,
[02:48:25.680 --> 02:48:34.240]  you could use strings, cords, anything. Yeah. So I take them like a little loop, you know,
[02:48:34.240 --> 02:48:38.320]  you don't want to tie like, you know, directly around the branch, but a little loop to where
[02:48:38.320 --> 02:48:43.760]  you can pull down on it and go down. Like if you got a plastic pot, drill a little hole in it.
[02:48:44.560 --> 02:48:50.080]  If you got a smart pot, poke a hole in it and you can take that string and take it down to there.
[02:48:50.080 --> 02:48:53.840]  And then, you know, pull, pull back on that string till you get it where you want it and then
[02:48:54.400 --> 02:48:59.680]  run it through one time and tie a square knot and done. And then it'll, you know, come back up and
[02:48:59.680 --> 02:49:06.080]  you can play around with different, you know, different configurations to, you know, fill in
[02:49:06.080 --> 02:49:11.520]  that square footage, that space that you're looking to fill in, whether it's one big plan
[02:49:11.520 --> 02:49:19.120]  or multiple ones, you know, and then, you know, defoliating correctly and getting, you know,
[02:49:19.120 --> 02:49:24.080]  those spaces in between. So you're getting good light penetration and everything and a nice,
[02:49:24.080 --> 02:49:30.720]  you know, respectably even canopy. And that's basically what you're looking for.
[02:49:31.440 --> 02:49:37.680]  Yeah, I've seen guys do it with scrug and with stakes and I did one, she was eight foot by eight
[02:49:37.680 --> 02:49:43.040]  foot, eight foot tall. And I just kept bending her out so that the center could come up into the
[02:49:43.040 --> 02:49:50.400]  light and man, what a lot of nice colas. Yeah, that's it, man. Yeah, you want to just, yeah,
[02:49:50.400 --> 02:49:55.920]  fill that, fill that space in as good as you can and just make sure that you got good air
[02:49:55.920 --> 02:50:01.360]  circulation. You know, you don't want to get in too crazy thick, but, you know, as long as you got
[02:50:01.360 --> 02:50:07.760]  some air movement going through there, you'll be good to go. Well, and you mentioned on your
[02:50:07.760 --> 02:50:13.680]  defoliation, I know I was taking anything that was pointing down, I was taking that off so that it was
[02:50:13.680 --> 02:50:18.080]  just the stuff that was up towards the light that could come up. Is that how you're doing it as well?
[02:50:18.800 --> 02:50:26.800]  I do that, but I like to leave my outward facing fans on and stuff that faces like inward,
[02:50:26.800 --> 02:50:31.840]  you know, that kind of overlap and block that light from, you know, the center of the plant coming down.
[02:50:32.640 --> 02:50:39.120]  I like to remove those inward, inward face ones and I typically like to do it like just prior to
[02:50:39.120 --> 02:50:44.800]  bloom by about a week. That way when I hit my stretch, a lot of those little small node sites
[02:50:44.800 --> 02:50:49.120]  get dominance from that fan leaf being gone and then when the stretch happens, they'll take off
[02:50:49.120 --> 02:50:56.400]  and kind of fill in those blank spaces in between all those colors, you know. Well, yeah, and then
[02:50:56.400 --> 02:51:01.200]  you've got a complete canopy. I see Brian's itching, brother. You want to say something, Brian?
[02:51:02.400 --> 02:51:08.960]  Oh, no, we got a, Ryan and I are quietly over here with IT problems where I got to fix it
[02:51:08.960 --> 02:51:14.560]  every like four minutes or so. It seems like I was just trying to fix that stuff, but I did want
[02:51:14.560 --> 02:51:21.680]  to give the mic real quick to Ryan. In my opinion, man, he's kind of representing and a lot of people
[02:51:21.680 --> 02:51:28.080]  are out there where, you know, a younger individual that understands farming, making his own inputs,
[02:51:28.080 --> 02:51:33.520]  thanks, you know, in part thanks to Marco, the show, all of those things. But moving forward,
[02:51:33.520 --> 02:51:38.000]  you know, he's also washing his own stuff and learning how to do that, talking to individuals.
[02:51:38.000 --> 02:51:42.000]  So, I wanted to let him kind of have the mic for a moment to be able to ask you a few questions.
[02:51:42.640 --> 02:51:50.480]  Yeah. What's up, Duke? I was just curious, what are you going to do for reamending with that soil
[02:51:50.480 --> 02:51:56.800]  that you got? Are you going to test and have like a pack, like a little reamendment pack, or
[02:51:56.800 --> 02:52:02.800]  is that a one-time soil? What do you got going for that? Well, what I used to do,
[02:52:03.200 --> 02:52:10.240]  as I said, I was always just kind of eyeballing, right? But, you know, that's like for me
[02:52:10.240 --> 02:52:16.000]  personally, you know, now that it's going to be a thing that's going to be out there for a public,
[02:52:17.120 --> 02:52:24.240]  I want to take that to a lab and, you know, actually understand exactly what's going on at
[02:52:24.240 --> 02:52:31.520]  certain cycles over the year and, you know, get like I said, something that's more of a dialed-in,
[02:52:31.520 --> 02:52:37.680]  you know, reamendment pack where you would top dress it and then, you know, maybe a little
[02:52:37.680 --> 02:52:45.120]  earthworm cast and bokashi over top of it and everything, let her break down. Like I said,
[02:52:45.120 --> 02:52:54.160]  in the past, the inputs that I use, I really didn't have to add a whole hell of a lot, you know,
[02:52:54.720 --> 02:53:00.720]  because the things that were being the most heavily used at those points week to week,
[02:53:00.720 --> 02:53:05.840]  you know, during a cycle, I was also inputting to make sure that like, you know, I'm giving it
[02:53:05.840 --> 02:53:12.480]  exactly what it wants when it needs it, you know, plant available and all. So, I never really ran
[02:53:12.480 --> 02:53:21.600]  into any issues and kept some going for sure it's like almost five years. So, yeah, so like it'll be
[02:53:21.600 --> 02:53:28.720]  a very minimal effort, you know, on the other person's end as far as having to do any of that.
[02:53:28.720 --> 02:53:35.520]  But once again, I will, you know, take it, kick it up a notch and actually take soil samples. And
[02:53:35.520 --> 02:53:40.640]  I'm also thinking like with different cultivars and the same pots, you know, run to run,
[02:53:41.200 --> 02:53:45.840]  actually seeing like which ones if anything changes in between, you know,
[02:53:46.880 --> 02:53:54.560]  you know, when I'm running. Yeah. The other thing I was going to ask you is about
[02:53:54.560 --> 02:54:01.200]  VPD, you mentioned, what are you doing as far as like nighttime VPD? And are you
[02:54:01.920 --> 02:54:07.040]  are you basing your VPD off leaf temperature or actual room temperature? Because I mean,
[02:54:08.160 --> 02:54:13.760]  when I read about it, people kind of vague about that. And I've always gone off leaf temperature
[02:54:13.760 --> 02:54:21.040]  personally. You're right on, man, because like, you're going to be, I guess, close with, you know,
[02:54:21.040 --> 02:54:26.320]  room temperature. But if you're going like after VPD and all that, obviously, like you're wanting
[02:54:26.320 --> 02:54:31.440]  it to excel. Yeah. So that you're correct, man, you would want to go off of actual
[02:54:32.560 --> 02:54:38.640]  canopy temperature. And you're, you know, like I said, when we're setting our rooms up and hitting
[02:54:38.640 --> 02:54:43.520]  the light meter and everything and making sure we got a good, even light spread, we don't have any
[02:54:43.520 --> 02:54:48.720]  like weird hot spots in the room, getting everything, like I said, dialed, really dialed.
[02:54:49.280 --> 02:54:54.720]  And like I used to have a FLIR gun, you know, for, you know, taking temps and stuff and then
[02:54:54.720 --> 02:55:00.160]  power plants and shit like that. I used to use that. Yeah, I got the same thing. All right.
[02:55:02.080 --> 02:55:08.000]  And when you were talking about. Oh, shit, I just forgot I was going to say.
[02:55:11.680 --> 02:55:15.280]  Well, let's show let's show them what because this is a mutual friend, I think of the
[02:55:16.080 --> 02:55:24.320]  show. I think I think Marco might know him too, right? TJ. TJ. Oh, yeah. On Instagram. He's like
[02:55:24.320 --> 02:55:32.960]  TJ Creatures. Yeah, this is his work. Oh, yeah. Homestead Hashco. Homestead Hashco. It comes in
[02:55:32.960 --> 02:55:38.800]  this nice. So, yeah, because this is it's a wood box that he hand makes every time.
[02:55:38.800 --> 02:55:46.880]  You know, I like that. That's cool. That's real. Yeah, damn right. But, you know, I don't know.
[02:55:46.880 --> 02:55:50.480]  It says naturally farmed living soil on the sides. I don't know if you can see that. You
[02:55:50.480 --> 02:55:56.240]  see the HS, though. So TJ was like my mentor. He's he's really brought me up into natural
[02:55:56.240 --> 02:56:02.960]  farming and everything. And that's super cool, man. That's super cool. But I was always into
[02:56:02.960 --> 02:56:08.320]  like dialing in environments because I was a salt grower for a long time. I didn't know any better.
[02:56:08.880 --> 02:56:12.720]  And buttery. But I was always interested in
[02:56:14.800 --> 02:56:20.800]  how the salt guys, I will give it to them that they some of them have environment dialed in.
[02:56:21.360 --> 02:56:28.240]  And that that alone will take you a lot of long way because it really will. And every. Yeah.
[02:56:29.440 --> 02:56:33.360]  Well, just come from just environment. You think you're low on other things, you start
[02:56:33.360 --> 02:56:38.560]  hammering that and now you got lockouts and it's crazy. But yeah, they're chasing chasing
[02:56:38.560 --> 02:56:43.760]  that dragon basically, you know, never come into the answer. Yeah. And going back to the
[02:56:43.760 --> 02:56:51.840]  BPD that that five degrees or so and plant temp to room temp is is huge in BPD, especially when
[02:56:51.840 --> 02:56:59.600]  you're trying to really hit numbers. And when you I just switched to LEDs. Do you do anything?
[02:56:59.600 --> 02:57:04.480]  Do you grow with LEDs by chance? Yeah, this is going to be my beginning right here, man.
[02:57:04.480 --> 02:57:11.200]  I never I never have previously. I got the room all fitted out with some text. I got the high
[02:57:11.200 --> 02:57:16.960]  base and then the two tents. I got the halos. They're like the more traditional, you know,
[02:57:16.960 --> 02:57:23.680]  like the multi bar deal. Yeah. So this would be it. But I've been taking notes, you know,
[02:57:23.680 --> 02:57:28.720]  from my friends and said that they've been doing it a while. I got a supplement, a little more
[02:57:29.200 --> 02:57:35.840]  magnesium than I normally would. And, you know, I've been running this room like I went ahead
[02:57:35.840 --> 02:57:41.840]  and inoculated all my soil pots to give the whole food web a little bit of a jump start before a
[02:57:41.840 --> 02:57:49.200]  plant ever lands in the pot and just been kind of looking at, you know, what my temperature is going
[02:57:49.200 --> 02:57:54.480]  to be looking like. At least I'll start to play with humidity, but get my room just right before
[02:57:54.480 --> 02:58:03.680]  the plants end up going into that room and, you know, checking temperature basically off of my
[02:58:03.680 --> 02:58:09.680]  hand. Yeah. You know, different ranges with that that LED because like you can definitely feel the
[02:58:09.680 --> 02:58:17.120]  intensity of it for sure. You know, so, yeah. Do you think you're running the room hotter than
[02:58:17.120 --> 02:58:25.040]  you would HBS? That's why I would say that. Yeah, because like I'm definitely not running
[02:58:25.040 --> 02:58:31.920]  the cooling like like I normally would have. Yeah. But yeah, the air circulation, everything,
[02:58:31.920 --> 02:58:37.840]  it just I guess it just feels like really good, you know, in there. And then you said once you're
[02:58:37.840 --> 02:58:42.960]  under that light in that footprint, though, like you feel that temperature shoot up. So like going
[02:58:42.960 --> 02:58:47.680]  back to what you were saying, like if you're looking to run, you know, really properly and
[02:58:47.680 --> 02:58:53.440]  really tuned in, you're going to want that temp in within that footprint of where that canopy is
[02:58:53.440 --> 02:59:01.280]  going to be. Yeah. Like I said, be dialed. Yeah. Well, yeah, that's all I really have for you.
[02:59:01.920 --> 02:59:04.480]  I had a Marco question, but I forgot about that one, too.
[02:59:04.480 --> 02:59:16.480]  I'm excited to run your your IMO three in this liquid IMO I'm going to do. Oh, nice.
[02:59:16.480 --> 02:59:23.040]  What I was going to ask you is how long do you think a maintenance solution would be shelf stable?
[02:59:24.880 --> 02:59:32.640]  I like to use that right away. You know, use it fresh. Oh, wait. Yeah. And FPGA and a brown rice
[02:59:32.640 --> 02:59:38.880]  vinegar. Yeah. Yeah. You can keep it because I use the same thing for like a SES as well. And
[02:59:38.880 --> 02:59:44.320]  I'll keep it in a bottle in the fridge. I'm going to keep. OK, but, you know, typically I'll just
[02:59:44.320 --> 02:59:49.760]  go ahead and mix it when I use it. But, you know, it's kind of play by everybody. Work both ways.
[02:59:51.280 --> 02:59:54.560]  OK. Yeah. Because I was playing around with the fish tanks and stuff. I'm trying to make
[02:59:54.560 --> 02:59:58.640]  like a maintenance solution from that. But I don't know how shelf stable it would be.
[02:59:59.360 --> 03:00:06.880]  But OK, so, well, I will say this now in that form. I know the fish waste is very, you know,
[03:00:06.880 --> 03:00:12.240]  stays really stable and, you know, in a bottle and a bottle because I do that. You know, I use
[03:00:12.240 --> 03:00:19.280]  my fish waste from my aquarium as well. And then there's also fish brew. Some of Layton's people.
[03:00:19.280 --> 03:00:26.720]  Yeah. They're there. Yeah. Yeah. I actually saw them up in Massachusetts and I bought a bottle
[03:00:26.720 --> 03:00:31.040]  from because I wanted to support, obviously, and try it. And it's some really nice stuff, man.
[03:00:31.680 --> 03:00:36.720]  I didn't scope it, but I scope my own and I see life that stays in there for a while out of that.
[03:00:38.400 --> 03:00:44.480]  So my aquariums, I got the reef tank, it's a saltwater tank. So I'm trying to incorporate
[03:00:44.480 --> 03:00:49.680]  that, but I'm scared with the salt. So I'm trying to dilute it and figure out ratios that I can
[03:00:50.480 --> 03:00:54.240]  like recommend to other people and all my friends and stuff. So.
[03:00:54.800 --> 03:00:59.120]  See, I like that idea. If I had a saltwater, I would, I was thinking the same thing,
[03:00:59.120 --> 03:01:03.840]  use that diluted instead of using the seawater. Like we'd go to the ocean and collect it.
[03:01:04.880 --> 03:01:10.240]  Aquarium seawater right there, probably even cleaner than some of the oceans around where
[03:01:10.240 --> 03:01:16.160]  we live nowadays, you know? Yeah. And it's elevated in calcium and magnesium and trace
[03:01:16.160 --> 03:01:21.520]  minerals and all that other good stuff. So I don't see any, how it could do anything bad, but.
[03:01:22.160 --> 03:01:28.880]  Exactly. Just in moderation. Exactly. Like Leighton says, don't be a moron.
[03:01:28.880 --> 03:01:34.560]  Exactly. Yeah. So Duke, I'm going to ask you one more question because we're just hitting the three
[03:01:34.560 --> 03:01:40.400]  hour mark here. And it's a very important one. Maybe the most important one is where do people
[03:01:40.400 --> 03:01:50.000]  find your genetics? Well, right now everything's sold out, but you can always look to seeds here
[03:01:50.000 --> 03:01:59.920]  now. That's always one. Rocky Mountain High 719 on Instagram. He's got a site, I believe now.
[03:02:01.280 --> 03:02:10.880]  He's he's always a good friend too. So he'll always have it. There may be one,
[03:02:11.760 --> 03:02:19.600]  well, two more added once the once the time comes, you know, but that that discord for right now is
[03:02:20.000 --> 03:02:25.200]  about the best place to catch me, you know, because like, you know, keep people kind of
[03:02:25.200 --> 03:02:29.520]  entertained and shit. We've got the free seed giveaway, but you know, also like throw up some
[03:02:29.520 --> 03:02:34.960]  old stuff on an auction and people like it. They enjoy that. I think it's like gambling
[03:02:34.960 --> 03:02:40.480]  type deal too. There's a gambling channel on there as well, where you can play a matter of fact,
[03:02:40.480 --> 03:02:45.280]  Brian, you can play dice. You can play. There you go, Brian.
[03:02:46.240 --> 03:02:54.800]  Yeah. It's called the yard too. Like your currency is postage stamps and you can buy like
[03:02:54.800 --> 03:03:01.840]  Keithy coffee, cigarettes, shanks, cell phone, whatever. Yeah. That's the first thing I would
[03:03:01.840 --> 03:03:10.480]  buy. You could buy, you could buy a toilet line too. Hey, I got a, I got a kind of a weird question.
[03:03:11.440 --> 03:03:15.360]  I see a lot of these cats, so I'm going to like, I guess it's kind of like a good answer,
[03:03:15.920 --> 03:03:21.360]  maybe bringing it up. Hopefully this person understands. So I see a lot of this kind of stuff.
[03:03:22.800 --> 03:03:31.330]  Can you see this or. Yeah, we're just getting a glare, Brian.
[03:03:32.690 --> 03:03:36.850]  So it's basically what I see is, you know, sometimes there's maybe, you know,
[03:03:36.930 --> 03:03:43.650]  to do this better than me. You can try to show the brand. But, but I, you know, I wanted to ask
[03:03:43.650 --> 03:03:47.730]  Duke and I want to ask you Marco, because, you know, you kind of find in your own identity
[03:03:47.730 --> 03:03:55.970]  sometimes, but some of these individuals more in the kind of, you know, working for yourself market,
[03:03:58.290 --> 03:04:02.050]  they're copying like other brands, which, which I kind of get. So it's like, you know,
[03:04:02.050 --> 03:04:05.410]  they have their little thing and this is the, how do you pronounce that again?
[03:04:07.730 --> 03:04:14.850]  Tapatio melts, right. But it's the Tapatio like brand of that big name brand. So I kind of want to
[03:04:15.410 --> 03:04:20.210]  talk about that before we, before Peter Sam back it up a little bit.
[03:04:23.410 --> 03:04:28.050]  So that's kind of, I guess my question to you boys is if you're building up your brand.
[03:04:28.210 --> 03:04:28.710]  Camera.
[03:04:32.530 --> 03:04:38.610]  You're saying like, if you got like dosey does, then you got looking like a gorilla glue,
[03:04:39.250 --> 03:04:44.210]  you know, those, those are more like commercial known, but there's so many of them in the
[03:04:44.210 --> 03:04:48.690]  underground, especially in California and stuff, Miami, there's just like all these different
[03:04:48.690 --> 03:04:53.810]  things that are like that. So if you're really trying to build a name for yourself with longevity
[03:04:53.890 --> 03:04:58.930]  in this game, thinking, you know, long-term instead of short-term, what are your thoughts
[03:04:58.930 --> 03:05:05.010]  on building a brand where the face of it or the, the logo that people are going to remember
[03:05:05.010 --> 03:05:09.090]  is a logo that technically you don't own. And then if it's a registered trademark,
[03:05:09.970 --> 03:05:14.850]  you know, you, from what I understand, they can send you like cease and desist and come after you.
[03:05:14.850 --> 03:05:17.330]  If you're actually, if your name's out there big enough.
[03:05:18.130 --> 03:05:23.170]  Yeah. Like cat man, like what the gorilla glue and all that. They got hit. Remember hit man,
[03:05:23.170 --> 03:05:29.250]  Dougie with the, with the fucking little Dabbergs Starbucks Dabbergs. Like he got, he got hit.
[03:05:29.890 --> 03:05:35.010]  Yeah. For real. Like, yeah, you can get hit. And like, even if it isn't registered,
[03:05:35.010 --> 03:05:40.050]  like why the fuck you want to ride somebody else's way? Like, you know what I mean? Like be yourself.
[03:05:41.810 --> 03:05:47.410]  And what they do is the problem is if you build your little brand off that, and then you're small
[03:05:47.410 --> 03:05:51.810]  and it's all no problem, but when you get big and get that money, that's when they're going to come
[03:05:51.810 --> 03:05:57.330]  take that back. So you're building on that. If this dude ever sees this or watches the show or
[03:05:57.330 --> 03:06:03.170]  anything, I'm only saying this because you have talent. Like, this is awesome. So I don't, I can't
[03:06:03.170 --> 03:06:07.730]  see you if you're thinking long-term, how are you going to be able to do that? Maybe change it up a
[03:06:07.730 --> 03:06:12.850]  little bit or, you know, have the same idea, but have somebody draw it out kind of like Marco and
[03:06:12.850 --> 03:06:18.690]  I did with the logo behind us or, you know, check out a Duke's new logo and, you know, all his gear
[03:06:18.690 --> 03:06:24.530]  coming soon. I think taking time to kind of find whatever is your role is going to be worth it, man.
[03:06:24.530 --> 03:06:30.530]  And I, you know, I'm just putting that out there for people that are running that. Cause, you know,
[03:06:31.170 --> 03:06:35.010]  there's a lot of individuals that like to do that where they're running some kind of like
[03:06:37.410 --> 03:06:42.050]  wave. It's like, it's like, it's thorough little wave and I get it and it's, you know, it's marketing
[03:06:42.050 --> 03:06:44.210]  and, but the potential there is...
[03:06:44.770 --> 03:06:50.130]  Everybody does that. You literally will blend into this big sea of the same shit.
[03:06:50.690 --> 03:06:56.210]  And at that point, like, you're not doing yourself any favors, you know? So just like, you know, be
[03:06:56.210 --> 03:07:01.970]  yourself, like however you're vibing, man. Like whatever you're about and shit, like delve into
[03:07:01.970 --> 03:07:06.770]  that, like sit back, think about it. And like I said, I'm not a fucking artist either, but like,
[03:07:06.770 --> 03:07:12.130]  I can come up with some ideas, you know what I mean? Like fucking, like this, this shit here,
[03:07:12.690 --> 03:07:18.770]  fucking that, that, that fucking you know, a little logo right there. Fucking yeah.
[03:07:18.770 --> 03:07:21.090]  It's in your state, the emblem.
[03:07:22.770 --> 03:07:28.050]  Yeah, man. But it started off with that. It's yeah, exactly. Fuck them. That's what I was
[03:07:28.050 --> 03:07:34.610]  thinking. But that skunk itself, like Mark Serlo, he's like a famous artist. He used to do
[03:07:35.890 --> 03:07:41.730]  like posters and album covers and a bunch of bands out there, a lot of jam bands and shit.
[03:07:41.730 --> 03:07:47.650]  But, you know, I traded him a quarter pound of weed, you know what I mean? Just to hook me up.
[03:07:47.650 --> 03:07:52.930]  I had an idea, but I can't draw for shit. So got him, got him hooked up, you know, got another
[03:07:52.930 --> 03:07:57.970]  idea, hit up my buddy Brad, you know, and if you don't know any artists like, sure, there's plenty
[03:07:57.970 --> 03:08:05.170]  of us, you know, so, you know, you can always get referrals and shit. And then, yeah, just put out,
[03:08:05.170 --> 03:08:09.570]  put out what your idea is, you know, you don't have to be a picture, like I said, just words,
[03:08:09.570 --> 03:08:14.210]  a good artist to take out and bring it to life for you. And then, boom, you got your own,
[03:08:14.210 --> 03:08:17.970]  your own image, your own marketing, you know, make your own waves, you know.
[03:08:21.970 --> 03:08:25.170]  Yeah, exactly. You know, and if you are going to have
[03:08:26.690 --> 03:08:31.810]  imitation, imitation is the sincerest form of intellectual property theft.
[03:08:34.210 --> 03:08:37.890]  And if you if you want to take it to the next level, you want to reach out to somebody like
[03:08:37.890 --> 03:08:41.730]  Bobby or the ones that Duke we're talking about where they're hand drawing this stuff,
[03:08:42.370 --> 03:08:46.530]  because it's really going to make it where no one can copy what you're doing. So when they do see
[03:08:46.530 --> 03:08:53.090]  that logo, when they do see that brand, I can I can test for myself, even just running Marco stuff,
[03:08:53.090 --> 03:08:57.010]  when it's on the table with our stuff, when certain people that watch the show, when they
[03:08:57.010 --> 03:09:04.610]  watch, walk by and they see that logo, they know exactly what that is. And again, that's, you know,
[03:09:04.610 --> 03:09:10.370]  kind of taking the time to get something dialed in so that there's nothing else that Marco has
[03:09:10.370 --> 03:09:16.930]  out there that I think could be easily replicated or duplicated. Be pretty tough because this
[03:09:16.930 --> 03:09:21.330]  the style that Bobby has as well, Marco's, I guess, is the better way to say that. It's pretty
[03:09:21.330 --> 03:09:27.650]  hard to get somebody to copy that style. Well, also, if you want to be a G about it, and I did
[03:09:28.290 --> 03:09:33.170]  micros by Marco is trademarked with the government, you know, go out of paperwork.
[03:09:33.170 --> 03:09:39.730]  You can actually do that on Rocket. You know, those online not rocket.
[03:09:41.170 --> 03:09:42.210]  Go, daddy and shit.
[03:09:42.210 --> 03:09:43.010]  E-files.
[03:09:43.010 --> 03:09:46.370]  So not go, daddy, but like the legal ones, legal zoom.
[03:09:46.370 --> 03:09:47.410]  Oh, legal zoom.
[03:09:47.410 --> 03:09:53.410]  Yeah, legal zoom. You can get your name trademarked and it's not that much. It takes a little bit of
[03:09:53.410 --> 03:09:58.050]  time for it to finally do. And then what happens is then you can have that protection. If someone
[03:09:58.210 --> 03:10:03.330]  tries to put my shit on the shelf and without my permission, then that's trademark. You know,
[03:10:03.330 --> 03:10:07.650]  I mean, you've got those little things you can do to kind of protect yourself.
[03:10:08.690 --> 03:10:13.890]  Oh, man. And what he just mentioned, that trademark is what all those companies have done
[03:10:13.890 --> 03:10:20.530]  for those individuals that are now doing the Skittles, you know, the ranchers. But those
[03:10:20.690 --> 03:10:26.770]  individuals on it. Yeah. Those are companies and they have huge pockets and they have lawyer,
[03:10:26.770 --> 03:10:31.490]  your lawyers, plural. So I just don't think the risk is there when you're trying to hustle.
[03:10:31.490 --> 03:10:36.130]  And even in the street game, man, if you start to get big enough, people know and
[03:10:37.970 --> 03:10:42.210]  to your homie, I know I've never met him or anything, but I hope that you realize that
[03:10:42.210 --> 03:10:46.850]  that talent is going to get you somewhere if you just kind of believe in yourself,
[03:10:46.850 --> 03:10:48.370]  I guess, and come up with your own shit.
[03:10:49.010 --> 03:10:54.050]  Brand recognition, man, brand recognition. And if you got something different, like shit,
[03:10:54.050 --> 03:10:59.170]  as as Brian fucking we was at that dude gross thing, I was like, what, two hours late getting
[03:10:59.170 --> 03:11:04.450]  it set up. People had already walked around, threw up that fucking that backdrop flag.
[03:11:05.410 --> 03:11:15.010]  Yeah. Threw up the flag. Yeah. People came right over, man. But yeah, brand recognition. That's a
[03:11:15.010 --> 03:11:19.970]  big part of marketing. And that is taking you a long time to build. And so I think that's the
[03:11:19.970 --> 03:11:25.410]  other thing is people maybe sometimes even the younger younger style generation, they think that
[03:11:25.410 --> 03:11:29.570]  it comes quick and quick is like a year to them. I think if you're really trying to build a brand,
[03:11:29.570 --> 03:11:35.730]  that's a three to five year move if you're starting from scratch and the talent, you know,
[03:11:35.730 --> 03:11:39.970]  that's that's the whole you're going to carry yourself. The Canadian marketing and the rest.
[03:11:39.970 --> 03:11:48.050]  Yeah. Yeah. There it is. Make it rain, make it rain. But yeah, man, that's a black.
[03:11:50.130 --> 03:11:54.210]  Oh, great, dude. While I got you, one of my homies on I.G. says,
[03:11:55.730 --> 03:11:59.970]  ask them which one of your which strains has the puck in it.
[03:11:59.970 --> 03:12:07.490]  He's trying to get some of your stuff around. There is. Well, he's going to have a hard time
[03:12:07.970 --> 03:12:16.370]  and stuff right now. Anything that had that dominion dominion skunk in it. Yeah. It had
[03:12:16.370 --> 03:12:24.050]  the skelly skunk it within that to make that male directly. There is one called Stash Plant,
[03:12:24.050 --> 03:12:29.570]  which was screaming eagle to the to the pup. OK, nice. And then he did say,
[03:12:30.530 --> 03:12:35.090]  why don't you release more of your stuff? But we already kind of know it's about that quality and
[03:12:35.090 --> 03:12:42.450]  takes time. Yeah. Yeah. Just yeah, it takes time, you know, so it like for my own
[03:12:43.810 --> 03:12:50.770]  solo venture stuff, you know, like it's going to be after New Year's for sure.
[03:12:51.650 --> 03:12:56.370]  I could probably see you bouncing around, hitting some other breeders and doing some collabs. Are
[03:12:56.370 --> 03:13:00.690]  you thinking about that kind of stuff? Yeah. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. Because I got a lot of
[03:13:01.250 --> 03:13:06.450]  friends and like we've already been been done. Did it all I had to do was get out the halfway house.
[03:13:06.450 --> 03:13:16.850]  But yeah, yeah, I was already in motion. Yeah. Yeah. That's cool. Yeah. Good things take time.
[03:13:16.850 --> 03:13:20.610]  And now when you do release them, you know, that'll be worth it. Everybody will realize that,
[03:13:20.610 --> 03:13:24.850]  you know, they took time to watch the show. Now, if they've never heard of you before,
[03:13:24.850 --> 03:13:29.810]  you know, now you realize what it really takes to create solid genetics for the community. And
[03:13:30.610 --> 03:13:35.170]  now now you also kind of know that internal clock that maybe Duke was kind of hopefully
[03:13:36.370 --> 03:13:41.490]  you guys picked up on that. Or if if somebody is pumping out this stuff constantly, like how is
[03:13:41.490 --> 03:13:49.570]  that being achieved? Even ethically, how is that being achieved? Yeah. And not a picture or review
[03:13:49.570 --> 03:13:57.970]  insight. Yeah. Yeah. They don't want you to know. They just want you to buy. Yeah, exactly. Man.
[03:13:57.970 --> 03:14:02.370]  Exactly. That's it. That's it. Cash and carry. See you later.
[03:14:04.050 --> 03:14:08.050]  30 feet or 30 seconds. Isn't that the term? Yeah, something like that.
[03:14:10.690 --> 03:14:15.410]  Ken, did we have any more questions? I know we pretty much covered everything and
[03:14:16.290 --> 03:14:19.730]  I had a couple, but I deleted them because we're already 15 minutes overtime.
[03:14:21.090 --> 03:14:25.410]  Well, we appreciate that, Duke. We you know, we always value your time, buddy. Thank you for
[03:14:25.490 --> 03:14:30.530]  coming on and doing this kind of stuff. And, you know, again, that's why I'm glad Ryan could be
[03:14:30.530 --> 03:14:36.210]  here with me. You know, there's just a whole generation that is skill set is just it's all
[03:14:36.210 --> 03:14:41.250]  inspiring, man, to be able to grow and wash and have it look the way that it does and to be able
[03:14:41.250 --> 03:14:46.690]  to chop it up with people like TJ, where he's mentoring you. I mean, that's you know, I don't
[03:14:46.690 --> 03:14:51.890]  even know if you could buy that, you know, like sometimes learning skill sets from individuals
[03:14:52.850 --> 03:14:57.490]  and taking their time up, you know, you can't buy that from them. So just shout out to everybody
[03:14:57.490 --> 03:15:03.490]  that not only is doing it, you know, as a medicine and an artistic manner, but is also taking the
[03:15:03.490 --> 03:15:09.330]  time to kind of mentor and take on to the new generation. Hey, here are some nuances. And
[03:15:09.330 --> 03:15:13.570]  Duke, I know that, you know, you've always kind of carried the torch for everybody in that by
[03:15:13.570 --> 03:15:18.850]  revealing the stuff, you know, at the beginning, man. So thank you for that. And hopefully then
[03:15:18.850 --> 03:15:24.210]  in time, Ryan will continue this. And I don't know, 15, 20 years from now, he's talking about
[03:15:24.210 --> 03:15:29.490]  stuff. That's what that's what we would love to see. And I think because of the boomer,
[03:15:29.490 --> 03:15:31.570]  we'll get some hash when I'm in the old folks home.
[03:15:33.010 --> 03:15:34.930]  Talking about some shit we never seen before.
[03:15:36.290 --> 03:15:37.170]  Beautiful dog, dude.
[03:15:39.650 --> 03:15:41.570]  Yeah, she's been bugging the piss out of me.
[03:15:42.130 --> 03:15:46.530]  Yeah, man. Thank you. Appreciate you, dude. This was a great show. Thank you,
[03:15:47.250 --> 03:15:53.250]  Ryan, you know, for swinging through and blessing brother Brian with some dabs over there.
[03:15:55.250 --> 03:15:55.810]  Keeping me quiet.
[03:15:57.810 --> 03:15:58.290]  Exactly.
[03:15:59.410 --> 03:16:04.450]  Yeah, man. So definitely, bro. We'll meet one of these days in person and chop it up real good.
[03:16:05.250 --> 03:16:05.810]  Oh, yeah.
[03:16:06.530 --> 03:16:10.930]  Do you have anything coming up this the next week or something?
[03:16:11.570 --> 03:16:19.090]  I got Saturday. I'm at homegrown RVA, Richmond, big worm and myself linking up again,
[03:16:19.090 --> 03:16:25.490]  doing a little combo education deal, a little session combined at the end of the hangout. So
[03:16:25.490 --> 03:16:29.890]  I hope everybody comes out, packs it in. And it's a free event. I mean,
[03:16:29.890 --> 03:16:34.850]  free, but I have a few inputs and things if anybody wants to add that to your garden,
[03:16:34.850 --> 03:16:35.650]  come check us out.
[03:16:36.850 --> 03:16:41.970]  Definitely. Do you got anything educational or anything new releases that you want to
[03:16:41.970 --> 03:16:43.250]  tease us with, brother?
[03:16:44.770 --> 03:16:49.410]  Educational. Never whittle toward yourself or piss against the wind.
[03:16:50.850 --> 03:16:52.210]  And don't eat yellow snow.
[03:16:53.250 --> 03:16:54.050]  Don't ever do that.
[03:16:54.770 --> 03:16:55.650]  Never a good time.
[03:16:57.650 --> 03:17:02.290]  Brian, I know you've got something coming up, brother. So maybe we want to mention
[03:17:02.290 --> 03:17:04.450]  that particular young lady again.
[03:17:05.650 --> 03:17:11.570]  Oh, yeah. So I probably even need to reach out to Duke with this and all the breeders
[03:17:11.570 --> 03:17:15.410]  are doing a great job. And I'm sure they're going to be doing a great job.
[03:17:15.410 --> 03:17:19.330]  I'm sure they're going to be doing a great job. And I'm sure they're going to be doing
[03:17:19.330 --> 03:17:24.290]  So I probably even need to reach out to Duke with this and all the breeders.
[03:17:24.290 --> 03:17:29.170]  I have now a few weeks to really take this and then behind the scenes.
[03:17:29.970 --> 03:17:37.410]  This was someone, if you see, that's her baby girl. The same time that my daughter was born.
[03:17:38.050 --> 03:17:43.730]  Unfortunately, there was complications with that, severe complications, being in the hospital and
[03:17:44.530 --> 03:17:50.050]  induced coma. And so to really talk about the details, I've reached out to
[03:17:51.810 --> 03:17:58.610]  a few girls that are going to be on the show. Jess and Katie. I know I'm forgetting a few of them.
[03:17:59.730 --> 03:18:04.210]  They're all going to be on the show kind of talking about this. And we want to auction off
[03:18:04.210 --> 03:18:10.450]  seeds. Duke, we did this for you, buddy, when you were at Penn State, buddy, studying well.
[03:18:11.330 --> 03:18:17.810]  You know, it's tough. And so this is the second time that I've done it. And I hope that the
[03:18:17.810 --> 03:18:24.130]  community sees that the first time I did it to help somebody that I thought definitely needed
[03:18:24.130 --> 03:18:30.210]  in the fucked up situation. So again, I think this is somebody else that is in need and in a
[03:18:30.210 --> 03:18:39.170]  fucked up situation. So, yeah, if you can reach out to my wife, Tasa 303, myself, Marco, you know,
[03:18:39.250 --> 03:18:44.130]  just individuals that are part of the show can if you know, if you know these individuals better,
[03:18:44.130 --> 03:18:47.890]  where we can start to get the seeds or people will pledge to actually ship them and that kind
[03:18:47.890 --> 03:18:53.010]  of stuff. I want everything to be on the up and up. Integrity is paramount with this. So if you
[03:18:53.010 --> 03:18:57.650]  pledge seeds, please ship them. You know, people are going to pay the money with that. And then
[03:18:57.650 --> 03:19:03.170]  the seeds need to get there in a timely manner. So I'm going to talk about that again. I'm going to
[03:19:03.170 --> 03:19:08.930]  make some flyers for this. But yes, we would really like just help from the community itself.
[03:19:08.930 --> 03:19:13.250]  If you don't have seeds or anything, then we're just asking for like five bucks. I think most
[03:19:13.250 --> 03:19:19.810]  people could could afford that. And that's a fair ask for the amount of people that we see and
[03:19:19.810 --> 03:19:24.770]  hopefully influence with this platform. So, again, this is for someone that is in need.
[03:19:25.410 --> 03:19:30.450]  This is something that I chose to do. Like she didn't reach out to me. So I want you guys to
[03:19:30.450 --> 03:19:35.330]  know that. And same thing with Duke. Like I just wanted to do it because it was somebody in the
[03:19:35.330 --> 03:19:41.490]  community that needed it. And here we are again. And what date is that going to be, Brian?
[03:19:42.130 --> 03:19:48.610]  September 1st. So we're going to get on the hype train here real shortly. And hopefully I can get
[03:19:48.610 --> 03:19:54.130]  a few of the ladies to maybe pop on and kind of talk about that. And, you know, as it's kind of a
[03:19:55.010 --> 03:20:00.770]  I don't know the right way to say that, like a teaser, but a trailer, you know, like of why it's
[03:20:00.770 --> 03:20:07.170]  important because it's just really sad, man, when you're. She should have been and she's in
[03:20:07.170 --> 03:20:11.810]  recovery and everything and life is turning around, so that's great. But at that moment, too,
[03:20:11.810 --> 03:20:17.250]  she should have had like joy because I felt like that might have that was stolen. And I can, you
[03:20:17.250 --> 03:20:23.010]  know, obviously in an unbelievable way relate to that because I think it was like a week or two
[03:20:23.010 --> 03:20:28.770]  away from when my daughter was born. Yeah, yeah. And that's fantastic. And the first isn't that
[03:20:28.770 --> 03:20:33.890]  far away, brother. That's only a few days away. So, yeah, you got to get that set up and moving.
[03:20:33.890 --> 03:20:39.250]  But yeah, I wish I could help. I know the wife is already committed to sending 50 bucks to that
[03:20:39.250 --> 03:20:45.650]  young lady. So you can look forward to that from us. Yeah, we'll definitely drop something on that
[03:20:45.650 --> 03:20:52.610]  to just send me a flyer or whatever. We'll post it and get it all. Yeah, just text me, dude.
[03:20:53.170 --> 03:20:59.410]  I'm looking at it right here. Yeah, buddy, I know. And hey, and that was the real beauty of it is
[03:20:59.410 --> 03:21:04.450]  that, you know, we were able to last time just kind of talk about stuff. So, you know, the
[03:21:04.450 --> 03:21:10.850]  community comes through and I hope that you guys see that, you know, we only ask when we feel like
[03:21:10.850 --> 03:21:17.570]  it's really warranted. And as I always say, remember, it's all about caring, sharing and community.
[03:21:17.570 --> 03:21:24.290]  That's what it's all about. Yeah, this thing has grown. You know, I think Peter had like
[03:21:25.170 --> 03:21:31.730]  30,000 followers, subscribers. So this thing is doubled. I mean, he has built quite the platform.
[03:21:31.730 --> 03:21:38.290]  So it's really cool that we can even do these kind of things and make an influence in someone's life.
[03:21:38.290 --> 03:21:44.130]  So hats off to all the behind the scenes stuff that it took to get here. And I think everybody
[03:21:44.130 --> 03:21:49.090]  knows even Duke, you know, you got your, you know, in a weird way, you got a little upper hand,
[03:21:49.090 --> 03:21:53.970]  man, because you do have that brand recognition. You've earned that every step of the way. But to
[03:21:53.970 --> 03:21:58.450]  even get those views on YouTube, the algorithm and all that, I mean, that's a bitch to grow a brand.
[03:21:59.090 --> 03:22:04.050]  So hats off to everybody that's putting in the work, trying to create content that
[03:22:04.050 --> 03:22:12.130]  people actually want to listen to. Yeah, yeah, definitely. And there's lots of voices out there.
[03:22:12.930 --> 03:22:18.290]  Listen to Marco. I love listening to Marco because he's so knowledgeable about everything that he
[03:22:18.290 --> 03:22:23.170]  talks about. And that's the person you need to reach out to on that topic. Just like
[03:22:23.170 --> 03:22:27.090]  Duke is somebody you would reach out to if you want to talk about breeding,
[03:22:27.090 --> 03:22:32.370]  but got to listen to many voices to get everything right. Many voices. That's right.
[03:22:33.490 --> 03:22:38.770]  Yeah, check out that discord, too. You know, I mean, there's in a weird way, cannabis is
[03:22:38.770 --> 03:22:43.970]  allows you to kind of pick the brain of some of the brightest minded individuals, where if you
[03:22:43.970 --> 03:22:49.490]  think about that in different industries, those brightest, the brightest in that industry, aren't
[03:22:49.490 --> 03:22:54.370]  going to make time for you. You know, I mean, if you're talking like big tech or big ag, even,
[03:22:54.370 --> 03:22:59.730]  or just, you know, thinking of the big individuals, you know, where the cannabis because Instagram is
[03:22:59.730 --> 03:23:03.970]  the only place where it's at, you know, people answer the DMZ seems like a little bit more. So
[03:23:04.690 --> 03:23:10.450]  the fact that you have that discord, Duke, you know, is got to be a treasure for the community.
[03:23:10.450 --> 03:23:14.690]  So if you're brand new to this, and you're not checking out those kind of things,
[03:23:14.690 --> 03:23:19.090]  I mean, what is back in the day, like you had like you had to be fucking MacGyver.
[03:23:19.090 --> 03:23:24.690]  Like you had to know how to do so much shit. Like, you know, you can see couldn't call up the
[03:23:24.690 --> 03:23:28.930]  HVAC guy, you can't call up the electrician, you know, you can't get the Palmer like you had to
[03:23:28.930 --> 03:23:34.770]  know how to do this shit. And basically, like all these old cats are just hanging around on there.
[03:23:34.770 --> 03:23:40.050]  And it's like, you just just it's like you got an open book of all these MacGyver motherfuckers
[03:23:40.050 --> 03:23:44.530]  that are really good at what they do. And more than happy to like share that knowledge with you,
[03:23:44.530 --> 03:23:49.890]  you know, grows in trees, did they say underground grows? Oh, yeah, the MacGyvers.
[03:23:50.610 --> 03:23:56.370]  Oh, yeah, absolutely, man. I grow a plant with some bubble gum and a paperclip.
[03:23:59.730 --> 03:24:05.170]  Hey, guys, I got to go. I'm going to have to end the broadcast rise. So I love you all.
[03:24:05.970 --> 03:24:11.730]  Anything else to say? No, I just appreciate it. Please hit that like button. That's all we ask.
[03:24:11.730 --> 03:24:16.130]  You know, I mean, I don't think that's too much to ask either. And do they hit it? There's like
[03:24:16.130 --> 03:24:19.810]  one hundred and seventy some likes out of one hundred and eighty viewing. So they actually
[03:24:19.810 --> 03:24:24.210]  hit the lights on. Awesome. Yeah. Yeah. Live long. Matters on the ground.
[03:24:25.170 --> 03:24:30.690]  And at one time we were up over 250, I think it was the top number that we hit today for live stream.
[03:24:30.690 --> 03:24:35.410]  Oh, no, that's awesome. Because this is it's pretty tough for people to attend this. They
[03:24:35.410 --> 03:24:40.130]  work like nine to five. Yeah. Daytime. And I'm hitting the end broadcast. So,
[03:24:40.130 --> 03:24:44.290]  Marco, if you want to start shouting out names, we'll go out that way, brother.
[03:24:44.290 --> 03:24:44.790]  Well.
