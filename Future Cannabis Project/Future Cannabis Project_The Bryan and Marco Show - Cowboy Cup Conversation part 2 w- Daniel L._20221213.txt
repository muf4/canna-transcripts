[00:00.890 --> 00:08.890]  What is up, cannabis community, living soil nerds, dirt dorks, everybody that's involved
[00:08.890 --> 00:13.850]  in really the cannabis community, and we mean that as in unity.
[00:13.850 --> 00:17.250]  We're kind of preaching to the choir today about some things, about how important it
[00:17.250 --> 00:23.770]  is to look out for each other, and understanding transparency and putting in a lot of work.
[00:23.770 --> 00:28.050]  Last week, as you guys know, if you haven't checked it out, we interviewed one side of
[00:28.050 --> 00:36.170]  the coin from the Cowboy Cup, which is a cannabis cup in Oklahoma.
[00:36.170 --> 00:41.730]  We reached out, part of it was even live on air, some people didn't want to come on, a
[00:41.730 --> 00:43.490]  lot of stuff behind the scenes.
[00:43.490 --> 00:47.570]  What I was amazed to find out is that Daniel and Greg wanted to come on the show.
[00:47.570 --> 00:48.570]  They wanted to be transparent.
[00:48.570 --> 00:52.290]  They wanted to sit here and answer questions.
[00:52.290 --> 00:57.690]  To my delight, I love to see this kind of stuff, man, even if it's debates or if some
[00:57.690 --> 01:00.050]  mistakes were made.
[01:00.050 --> 01:05.050]  The cannabis community will respect you a lot more when you own up to certain things,
[01:05.050 --> 01:06.610]  when you face things.
[01:06.610 --> 01:11.370]  When certain things have happened and individuals don't want to be put on the spotlight, when
[01:11.370 --> 01:15.050]  they chose to be in the spotlight, it's kind of telling.
[01:15.050 --> 01:17.690]  Today is something that I've looked forward to.
[01:17.690 --> 01:22.290]  I hope that other people see in time that this is a place for dialogue.
[01:22.290 --> 01:23.810]  We don't have a dog in this fight.
[01:23.810 --> 01:26.250]  We're all just sitting here trying to figure out what happened.
[01:26.250 --> 01:31.250]  The only reason we're even in this little drama thing is because you guys care.
[01:31.250 --> 01:32.570]  You guys give a shit.
[01:32.570 --> 01:37.370]  You guys saw that this was a, hopefully in time, going to be a national thing, something
[01:37.370 --> 01:43.410]  that the community, at least from Colorado and other states looking inward, you guys
[01:43.410 --> 01:48.730]  saw that as a national thing, that you wanted a lot of us to fly in and be a part of that.
[01:48.730 --> 01:51.410]  I think it was picking up steam.
[01:51.410 --> 01:55.770]  To be fair to you guys, I think that's why a lot of frustration, feelings were a certain
[01:55.770 --> 01:59.650]  way, emotions were high, is because people actually gave a shit.
[01:59.650 --> 02:02.770]  To be honest with you, Daniel, if they didn't, we wouldn't be talking about it, man.
[02:02.770 --> 02:06.970]  People wouldn't have reached out to all of us, as well as other individuals that have
[02:06.970 --> 02:09.130]  podcasts and stuff.
[02:09.170 --> 02:15.090]  I'm just trying my best to wrap this all together.
[02:15.090 --> 02:18.650]  The reality is, guys, is we're going to be able to be as transparent as we can with the
[02:18.650 --> 02:19.650]  organizers.
[02:19.650 --> 02:24.730]  If you have that burning question that you just want to really find out, Mr. Westport
[02:24.730 --> 02:25.730]  is here.
[02:25.730 --> 02:27.090]  We got fantastic individuals.
[02:27.090 --> 02:32.530]  I feel like for us to sit here and just have a dialogue, open and candid dialogue, nobody's
[02:32.530 --> 02:39.170]  trying to be anything other than just conversations and figuring things out.
[02:39.170 --> 02:44.210]  It looks like also from watching other podcasts on Friday with the Dunge crew and that kind
[02:44.210 --> 02:48.930]  of stuff, some mistakes were made, but you owned up to it on the show and stuff.
[02:48.930 --> 02:54.810]  Before we get started, I wanted to salute you for that.
[02:54.810 --> 03:00.290]  It's hard to put on a massive thing like that and not have some hiccups, not have some issues.
[03:00.290 --> 03:05.330]  In fairness, because of how prestigious this was, I feel like the other side now gets to
[03:05.330 --> 03:07.930]  kind of find out from you guys what happened.
[03:07.930 --> 03:10.730]  I want to give it to Marco, and then we're going to give it to Chad, and then we'll get
[03:10.730 --> 03:11.730]  into this.
[03:11.730 --> 03:12.730]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:12.730 --> 03:13.730]  Happy Tuesday.
[03:13.730 --> 03:16.010]  Good to see everybody.
[03:16.010 --> 03:20.010]  We thought this was going to be a one and done here on the Cowboy Cup, but ended up
[03:20.010 --> 03:23.850]  going two back to back, and that's fine.
[03:23.850 --> 03:28.210]  The reason being, like Brian said, we do want a dialogue.
[03:28.210 --> 03:30.810]  It's about growing and growing our industry.
[03:30.810 --> 03:38.050]  When you have these cups, any competition, any sport, anything you do, things are going
[03:38.050 --> 03:44.530]  to happen, and things now have to be changed with the procedures or the rules or whatever
[03:44.530 --> 03:45.530]  to make it better.
[03:45.530 --> 03:50.490]  The whole goal of this is to have an open conversation, even with the chat.
[03:50.490 --> 03:54.050]  Give us a little bit more than, hey, you guys suck.
[03:54.050 --> 03:55.770]  That's not productive.
[03:55.770 --> 03:58.290]  Everybody knows there's kind of like two sizes thing.
[03:58.290 --> 04:00.850]  We know some inappropriate things were said.
[04:00.850 --> 04:02.650]  There were some apologies given.
[04:02.650 --> 04:08.370]  We kind of want to get outside of that and kind of get a little bit deeper into cups
[04:08.370 --> 04:13.650]  and the procedures and how things are done, because I look at it from a grower's standpoint.
[04:13.650 --> 04:17.290]  I know we'll talk about all that.
[04:17.290 --> 04:22.170]  When you submit a sample, it's kind of a piece of you.
[04:22.170 --> 04:26.650]  It takes a lot for you to hand over your work to somebody and trust that, hey, this
[04:26.650 --> 04:31.930]  work is going to go through the process the right way and be fairly judged.
[04:31.930 --> 04:32.930]  You know what I mean?
[04:32.930 --> 04:39.050]  Therefore, when people enter, it's always important to have that transparency.
[04:39.050 --> 04:40.050]  Thank you all for being here.
[04:40.050 --> 04:41.050]  Chad, glad to see you back, buddy.
[04:41.050 --> 04:42.050]  You all know me.
[04:42.050 --> 04:43.050]  I kind of have my little opinions and my thoughts along the way.
[04:43.050 --> 04:44.050]  I'm just going to keep sticking to that MO and give it to Chad.
[04:44.050 --> 04:45.050]  I'm going to give it to him.
[04:45.050 --> 04:46.050]  I'm going to give it to him.
[04:46.050 --> 04:47.050]  I'm going to give it to him.
[04:47.050 --> 04:48.050]  I'm going to give it to him.
[04:48.050 --> 04:49.050]  I'm going to give it to him.
[04:49.050 --> 04:50.050]  I'm going to give it to him.
[04:50.050 --> 04:51.050]  I'm going to give it to him.
[04:51.050 --> 04:52.050]  I'm going to give it to him.
[04:52.130 --> 04:55.570]  I'm going to give it to Chad and jump on in there and let's just kind of get the conversation
[04:55.570 --> 04:56.570]  going.
[04:56.570 --> 05:00.250]  Well, thank you very much.
[05:00.250 --> 05:03.010]  And you know, I'm glad to be here and be part of the conversation.
[05:03.010 --> 05:08.810]  I put up this special little background because I might be playing some devil's advocate today.
[05:08.810 --> 05:14.010]  I see this situation in many different ways from many different angles.
[05:14.010 --> 05:19.810]  Not being personally invested or involved helps me because it removes emotion from the
[05:19.810 --> 05:21.050]  situation.
[05:21.050 --> 05:23.290]  And emotion is what a lot of us feed off of.
[05:23.290 --> 05:30.330]  And kind of one thing that I want to just mention at the beginning is right now, we're
[05:30.330 --> 05:35.970]  talking with Daniel and company from the Cowboy Cup, which is awesome.
[05:35.970 --> 05:43.410]  But this entire scenario can be broken down into a few different areas of concern.
[05:43.410 --> 05:49.170]  And those areas of concern lay in different or with different people.
[05:49.290 --> 05:54.850]  So while we would love to maybe get the full big picture answer of everything and the motivations
[05:54.850 --> 06:01.410]  and everything that went on behind it, in all fairness, Daniel and company is not going
[06:01.410 --> 06:02.970]  to be able to answer everything.
[06:02.970 --> 06:07.850]  But we thank them for coming here to address specifically what they can answer.
[06:07.850 --> 06:10.850]  And that's the whole point is just to try to get some clarity.
[06:10.850 --> 06:13.290]  I appreciate you guys coming here.
[06:13.890 --> 06:18.690]  Thank you very much for jumping in front of the train, as they so to say.
[06:18.690 --> 06:19.690]  Exactly.
[06:19.690 --> 06:23.490]  And let me circle back because I kind of, I didn't finish my full point.
[06:23.490 --> 06:28.890]  From the grower standpoint, also talking about what the grower is doing and submitting because
[06:28.890 --> 06:31.130]  it goes, there's two people there.
[06:31.130 --> 06:36.010]  There's the grower providing that excellent product and then there's the excellent product
[06:36.010 --> 06:39.170]  being taken to that next step.
[06:39.250 --> 06:43.770]  So open conversation chat, feel free to jump in there.
[06:43.770 --> 06:46.930]  And yeah, go ahead, Brian, what you got buddy?
[06:46.930 --> 06:52.090]  Yeah, I think in fairness, it's a lot of people just kind of see things they read maybe a
[06:52.090 --> 06:54.050]  few descriptions or something like that.
[06:54.050 --> 06:55.530]  And then they run with a lot of stuff.
[06:55.530 --> 07:01.410]  I wanted to give Daniel and Greg the opportunity to talk about why they threw the cup, what
[07:01.410 --> 07:07.450]  it took to be in the cup so that everybody can hear from the horse's mouth basically.
[07:07.450 --> 07:11.730]  Everybody has kind of gotten to the point where they were told it was $375 plus two
[07:11.730 --> 07:14.210]  ounces of weed to enter.
[07:14.210 --> 07:18.010]  If those are the facts, those are the kind of things that I guess that more individuals
[07:18.010 --> 07:22.330]  would like to hear from you guys so that they can just understand and weed out all of the
[07:22.330 --> 07:26.170]  bullshit noise because there has been a lot of noise obviously these last two weeks.
[07:26.170 --> 07:31.850]  So let's just get to that and be as transparent as we can about what you guys set up for the
[07:31.850 --> 07:32.850]  community.
[07:32.850 --> 07:34.050]  Yeah, man.
[07:34.050 --> 07:38.850]  So let's, you know, a lot of people have been like, so what was this first, second year?
[07:38.850 --> 07:42.530]  Let's just let's start at the beginning and let's, you know, let's talk about being open
[07:42.530 --> 07:44.490]  and clear and transparent.
[07:44.490 --> 07:48.530]  You know, again, I don't have a dog in the fight either, you know, and that's kind of
[07:48.530 --> 07:55.170]  one of the things that was that's nice about having me in this position.
[07:55.170 --> 08:02.490]  You can go back and look at all the awards, all the junk about a bot cup are all easily,
[08:02.490 --> 08:04.530]  you know, found to be false.
[08:04.530 --> 08:09.970]  There's a lot of big sponsors that haven't won a lot and they're great sponsors.
[08:09.970 --> 08:11.770]  It just it was it's never going to be that way.
[08:11.770 --> 08:12.770]  And so I'm done.
[08:12.770 --> 08:14.650]  You're really done with that conversation.
[08:14.650 --> 08:20.310]  But what I wanted to mention was, you know, we started year one wanting to throw a competition
[08:20.310 --> 08:22.770]  that everybody was proud of.
[08:22.770 --> 08:23.770]  Right.
[08:23.770 --> 08:30.890]  And so that takes everybody's opinion on how a competition is to be ran.
[08:30.890 --> 08:38.250]  And so it's kind of this it's this moving it's this ever moving, you know, piece that
[08:38.250 --> 08:42.010]  we're trying to stay on top of a lot of the stuff you guys are talking about, you know,
[08:42.010 --> 08:47.530]  operating procedures and clarity and openness and transparency as to what's going on, because
[08:47.530 --> 08:48.530]  you guys are right.
[08:48.530 --> 08:53.450]  I mean, you we're talking about people that have spent all year long just loving and loving
[08:53.450 --> 08:58.810]  this plant and protecting it from all the shitty elements in Oklahoma.
[08:58.810 --> 09:02.410]  And you know, to find out that, you know, somebody found mold in it, you know, there's
[09:02.410 --> 09:05.310]  obviously going to be a lot of questions.
[09:05.310 --> 09:08.890]  But I'm here to tell you, the questions don't aren't out here.
[09:08.890 --> 09:11.410]  The questions are right down the shotgun barrel.
[09:11.410 --> 09:15.730]  You know, I said on Adam Dunn, what why are we criticizing Bar H?
[09:15.730 --> 09:16.930]  Yeah, they were a sponsor.
[09:16.930 --> 09:20.250]  They were a silver sponsor, a little, you know, kind of a lower level sponsor.
[09:20.250 --> 09:21.530]  So be it.
[09:21.530 --> 09:22.530]  They've got great product.
[09:22.530 --> 09:26.410]  And the problem we're having right now is everybody's pointing blame and saying this
[09:26.410 --> 09:30.370]  wasn't so and you know, whatever people's issues are.
[09:30.370 --> 09:36.610]  The real issue is, is we've got to find we've got to find stable phenos in Oklahoma that
[09:36.610 --> 09:38.970]  can withstand our environment.
[09:38.970 --> 09:41.330]  And that's exactly what Bar H did.
[09:41.330 --> 09:43.050]  They had one fail too.
[09:43.050 --> 09:47.850]  But they've been on a they've been pheno hunting a Mandelbrot Royal Cush strain.
[09:47.850 --> 09:51.930]  And we're super happy to find out that it was very mold resistant.
[09:51.930 --> 09:55.530]  So you know, that's kind of the other side of this coin.
[09:55.650 --> 10:02.610]  But when we started, I'd never thrown a competition before I went down to Emerald Cup in 2016.
[10:02.610 --> 10:08.050]  My friend's wife was the vendor coordinator, ex wife was a vendor coordinator at the time.
[10:08.050 --> 10:13.730]  And so I was just kind of enamored with, you know, the community and all the people that
[10:13.730 --> 10:14.730]  had come together.
[10:14.730 --> 10:17.970]  And of course, it's the first time that I'd been to a cannabis event like that.
[10:17.970 --> 10:19.650]  We've all been closeted our whole lives.
[10:19.650 --> 10:23.850]  And so to walk into something like that, you know, and I see it at Cowboy Cup all the time,
[10:23.890 --> 10:27.410]  you know, older people walking in that are I mean, I've seen people cry before.
[10:27.410 --> 10:29.690]  You know, it's like, hey, we've been stuck in a closet.
[10:29.690 --> 10:32.410]  You know, we just want to have a you know, it's nice to have a place to come out.
[10:32.410 --> 10:35.570]  And so I just say all that to say I didn't have a lot of experience.
[10:35.570 --> 10:37.610]  I'm a construction manager by trade.
[10:37.610 --> 10:41.890]  So I'm a scheduler estimator and things of that things of that sort.
[10:41.890 --> 10:43.970]  But you know, it all kind of plays into the event side.
[10:43.970 --> 10:48.650]  So the competition, I've always reached out to the community and said, hey, you know,
[10:48.650 --> 10:50.930]  what what do you guys think is best, right?
[10:50.930 --> 10:53.810]  So year one, we just we just kind of ran with it.
[10:53.810 --> 10:55.490]  And it was it was as simple as it got.
[10:55.490 --> 11:00.890]  We we had judges, you know, patients from across the state picked up judge packs.
[11:00.890 --> 11:02.930]  They judged it. And it was the end of the thing.
[11:02.930 --> 11:11.690]  Well, the beauty of what we had year one was that in the whole the whole premise around the competition
[11:11.690 --> 11:18.210]  and what I can do with the competition was this right then for at that time, full panel tests were like three hundred and seventy five bucks.
[11:18.210 --> 11:20.490]  I don't think they're a whole lot cheaper now.
[11:20.490 --> 11:24.450]  Entry into my competition was three twenty five.
[11:24.450 --> 11:29.850]  I partnered with fast labs to let everybody bring their samples into them.
[11:29.850 --> 11:32.050]  So they brought their they brought two separate samples.
[11:32.050 --> 11:38.450]  So they brought me whatever it was. I think it was an ounce and three quarters and they had to bring a quarter to fast labs.
[11:38.450 --> 11:41.810]  Well, everything got, you know, so I paid for all the testing.
[11:41.810 --> 11:48.210]  Fast lab sponsored. Nothing failed. Zero zero fails, which is an anomaly.
[11:48.210 --> 11:54.130]  I mean, if we can call, you know, 100 percent or 25 percent an anomaly, zero is an anomaly.
[11:54.130 --> 11:57.450]  Now, inject fast labs isn't in business anymore.
[11:57.450 --> 11:59.730]  Did they actually even test it? I don't know.
[11:59.730 --> 12:04.770]  You know, to be completely honest with you, it's out of my hands, but I can tell you, none of them.
[12:04.770 --> 12:09.610]  Year two, we set up to do the same thing with Express Toxicology.
[12:09.610 --> 12:14.570]  Express Toxicology came in and wanted to be the presenting sponsor, which we thought, fuck, yeah, this is you know,
[12:14.610 --> 12:19.730]  we never wanted the presenting sponsor to enter the competition, you know, just for that, for any conflict of interest.
[12:19.730 --> 12:23.130]  And so we thought it was a good opportunity to partner with them.
[12:23.130 --> 12:26.370]  So we partnered with them. We followed for all the pickup.
[12:26.370 --> 12:30.530]  We follow them around and they they intake with us that sample.
[12:30.530 --> 12:37.490]  So the grower, the contestant actually had to give their sample to a lab technician on site.
[12:37.490 --> 12:43.770]  I think two of them, two of the pickups were at labs and then two of them were mobile, mobile pickups.
[12:43.770 --> 12:46.450]  But given to the lab, nonetheless.
[12:46.450 --> 12:56.130]  And so what we what we have later on is 27, I think it was 27 percent of everything else failed, mainly flower.
[12:56.130 --> 13:01.770]  I think they did find some stuff in some of the solvents or the solventless and the solvent hash categories.
[13:01.770 --> 13:09.410]  But they failed 100 percent of, I think, 50 or 60 sun grown entries by lab.
[13:09.410 --> 13:18.330]  Then everybody throws a big fit and says Express Toxicology wasn't cleaning their machines and so yet again, there's another you know, there's got to be a controversy at the cut.
[13:18.330 --> 13:23.810]  So that was controversy that that. And let me mention halfway through that.
[13:23.810 --> 13:33.570]  I'm sorry, I forgot to mention we had a prominent lawyer in the state call me and tell me that the that everything had to be pre tested.
[13:33.570 --> 13:42.890]  So year two, they came with a they came with a test from from their certified lab and Express Toxicology came in and failed 100 percent of the sun grown.
[13:42.890 --> 13:48.530]  And like I said, 27 percent of the rest of them, giant fucking shit show.
[13:48.530 --> 13:51.530]  So we get through all of that and I say, OK, fuck it.
[13:51.530 --> 13:59.690]  We're going back to your tests. We're going to let you guys, you know, just just provide the test and move on.
[13:59.690 --> 14:11.690]  So incomes incomes year four, we thought that by bringing in Ganja and we still think that that elevated our competition, I in no way saw them trying to get a leg up.
[14:11.690 --> 14:15.370]  Are they advertising at Cowboy Cup? Yeah, everybody's advertising a cowboy cup.
[14:15.370 --> 14:21.410]  That's what Cowboy Cup is. It's an advertising platform because we all know cannabis doesn't have a lot of advertising platforms.
[14:21.410 --> 14:27.010]  So, yeah, were they advertising there? But I don't think that they had any ill intentions.
[14:27.010 --> 14:32.930]  So what happened to answer you? And I think I said this on on Adam.
[14:32.930 --> 14:35.690]  What happened is Wednesday I get a phone call from Ganja.
[14:35.690 --> 14:41.490]  They're they're at an Airbnb and they say they found a bunch of mold.
[14:41.490 --> 14:47.570]  So I go over there and I look and I confirm that they had found mold under digital microcontaminants as well.
[14:47.570 --> 14:50.890]  Other contaminants, too. I'm sorry. It wasn't just mold. It was.
[14:50.890 --> 14:53.810]  I don't mean I don't mean to interrupt, but I want to clarify.
[14:53.810 --> 15:03.290]  So when you give these when you've given these samples to these Ganja, the judges that you had, the judges, they've already looked at all these samples, correct?
[15:03.290 --> 15:08.330]  Yeah, my my judges had had them for two weeks outdoor. It had them for two weeks.
[15:08.330 --> 15:16.450]  Indoor, they'd had for two months. And so which I think might might be a little bit of the problem, but I just kind of wanted to let you know what you know, kind of what went down.
[15:16.450 --> 15:17.890]  And you guys can ask me questions from there.
[15:17.890 --> 15:28.330]  But so they let they let me know. I come back to my office and I grab clean samples that we had made back at lettuce bar at drop off one day after drop off.
[15:28.330 --> 15:33.090]  They they brought in the samples the 10th through the 12th of November.
[15:33.090 --> 15:37.410]  The 13th, we had them turned around in that same facility, which is impeccably clean.
[15:37.410 --> 15:42.290]  Anybody that's been there knows that. And then we turned them around to our judges on the 14th.
[15:42.290 --> 15:47.610]  Ganja got them two weeks later, I believe that was on the 28th.
[15:47.610 --> 15:55.330]  But they had found the mold and found the contaminants. And I told them at that point to document said contaminants.
[15:55.330 --> 16:03.530]  I did. We did actually talk and I and the plan was going to be I was going to call everybody and let them know before the award ceremony, unfortunately.
[16:03.530 --> 16:09.490]  And like I said, I've already apologized for that. That didn't happen due to time constraint, whatever it was.
[16:09.490 --> 16:14.330]  I'm not here to make excuses. I've already apologized for that. I probably should have done that better.
[16:14.330 --> 16:19.210]  There's a lot. And you guys can give your opinions on how I could have done that better as well. And we'll sure as hell listen to those.
[16:19.210 --> 16:26.170]  What was the date of the cup again? So the competition was the second and third of December.
[16:26.170 --> 16:33.170]  That was the award. That's the award ceremony. OK, all the judging's done pre.
[16:33.210 --> 16:39.450]  OK, what were the credentials to be a Cowboy Cup judge before the God's year?
[16:39.450 --> 16:46.970]  Yeah. So just so I went through we had four hundred and something applications.
[16:46.970 --> 16:54.730]  I went through and basically. Did it blind? I had no names on the list.
[16:54.730 --> 17:03.410]  Everything was 100 percent based off of their qualifications and what made them think that they could be a good judge.
[17:03.410 --> 17:10.770]  So an application process and then Greg selected them and then talked to them and then we do a judge's training with Swami.
[17:10.770 --> 17:14.410]  That was two years in a row that we've done a done a judge's training with them.
[17:14.410 --> 17:21.970]  But they're just selected. They're just Oklahoma patients. And, you know, the reason we we started out doing that, we got a little bit of criticism because, yeah, they're not pros.
[17:21.970 --> 17:28.650]  But what we always thought was, hey, we're in Oklahoma holding the competition, trying to find the Oklahoma trends in the market, too.
[17:28.650 --> 17:44.130]  So, you know, it's a it's almost a good thing that at least there for a while until we got this this fierce of competition, this close of competition that, hey, we're using judges, even though they may not be the Somali or Ghangi or whatever you want to call them.
[17:44.130 --> 17:51.800]  At least we could see what what the people in Oklahoma were looking for. And we thought that was beneficial.
[17:51.800 --> 17:58.640]  Real quick, we had a question here for you. We know Daniel in the blue and then we're just curious.
[17:58.640 --> 18:05.120]  Greg. Greg. OK. Yeah. Greg's our vendor coordinator. Awesome. Our everything coordinator.
[18:05.120 --> 18:11.720]  So what so if you what are the judge packs look like? You know, if I'm a judge, what did I get?
[18:11.720 --> 18:18.400]  So I have to work through it. Sure. So let's just talk about indoor flower, indoor flower.
[18:18.400 --> 18:24.080]  We we picked up the twenty second, twenty third and twenty fourth of September.
[18:24.080 --> 18:30.160]  It took us a week to get those judge packs made just because there was one hundred and twenty six some odd entries.
[18:30.160 --> 18:33.200]  That's the wrong number. I think it was one hundred twenty six, one hundred twenty six entries.
[18:33.200 --> 18:38.120]  Of course, we've got metric now, so it takes time to get all the stuff put in the system and make judge packs.
[18:38.120 --> 18:49.120]  So basically what occurs in that room is we've got me, Greg, Wade and Kelly Searcy are the only ones that we ever have in that room because we want to keep it.
[18:49.120 --> 18:54.960]  You know, it's it's a it's a blind competition. So as few people as we can keep in there, we want to keep in there.
[18:54.960 --> 19:04.120]  And the process goes, we've got several nonstick trays that we bring in that that we've sanitized everyone.
[19:04.120 --> 19:09.760]  Kelly will take these jars. So here's our jars. I thought we were stepping up the game this year.
[19:09.760 --> 19:16.960]  And so we had nice glass jars, got a nice lid. We feel like they do tighten and seal nicely.
[19:16.960 --> 19:23.400]  We take the entry that's either in a jar or a bag, hopefully in a jar, sometimes in a bag.
[19:23.400 --> 19:29.600]  And Wade with with a brand new clean set of gloves on and he usually uses little pinchers, too.
[19:29.640 --> 19:34.480]  He'll take the butt out, one out of the one out of the bag, stick in the jar, one of the bags, stick in the jar.
[19:34.480 --> 19:39.760]  And we had 14 we had 14 judges this year. So there'd be 14 jars.
[19:39.760 --> 19:43.400]  They all go in the jars that have been we put a see if you can say that.
[19:43.400 --> 19:51.880]  But that was our numbering system. Just a nice, simple, you know, sticker like you'd get at Walmart or whatever it was, a retail label.
[19:51.880 --> 19:57.200]  They get numbered and then they get put in judge packs that are laid out. They're in new boxes as well.
[19:57.200 --> 20:01.960]  So we fill them all in one by one. There was 42 for each judge pack.
[20:01.960 --> 20:11.520]  We had four judge panels this year. And so each each judge panel of 14 judges got 42 samples.
[20:11.520 --> 20:20.440]  They had basically two months to to sample all of those, which seemed, you know, we try to keep it one or two a day for obvious reasons.
[20:20.440 --> 20:27.200]  Right. And and they like I said, they have about two months to do that indoors, a little bit different.
[20:27.200 --> 20:34.160]  Like I said, I mean, I'm sorry. Outdoors, a little bit different. We took Thursday, Friday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday intake.
[20:34.160 --> 20:38.200]  Sunday, we put them all together in one day since there was only 20 entries.
[20:38.200 --> 20:41.920]  It was really easy to get them into metric and get them out. So we got them around in one day.
[20:41.920 --> 20:47.320]  Our judges pick them up that next Monday. You know, we generally in the past,
[20:47.320 --> 20:52.640]  we try to take good care not to have not to leave the jars open very long, but that's mainly for terpene retention.
[20:52.640 --> 20:57.000]  The mold thing hasn't been a problem, but, you know, we do that for terpene retention, too.
[20:57.000 --> 21:04.920]  So that answer your question? Yeah. So, OK. So, yeah, that was just kind of working more curious on that procedure.
[21:04.920 --> 21:10.240]  But yeah, I mean, that all sounds pretty standard. Now, when you got the outdoor, you all seen it.
[21:10.280 --> 21:17.600]  What it looked like, were they buck, were the buds really big and were they bucked down nice and like they should be?
[21:17.600 --> 21:21.800]  No, most of them were pretty big. That's not to say that they were across the board.
[21:21.800 --> 21:24.880]  But for the most part, outdoor comes in a whole lot bigger.
[21:24.880 --> 21:29.040]  People like to show off their big nugs, which we which is a problem to us,
[21:29.040 --> 21:32.760]  because what will happen is they'll give us two ounces and it'll be 10 giant buds.
[21:32.760 --> 21:36.760]  Well, guess what happens, you guys? We have to break them down to get them into the judge kits.
[21:36.760 --> 21:40.160]  And nobody wants us to do that or break them down to get them into a jar that big.
[21:40.160 --> 21:44.840]  And this jar will hold a pretty, pretty substantial, you know, two, two and a half gram nugs.
[21:44.840 --> 21:48.040]  But yeah, the outdoor tend to be a little bit bigger.
[21:48.040 --> 21:58.840]  Yeah, because I'm just thinking my personal outdoor, I'm in zone seven B in Virginia and I was harvesting November 3rd through like the 10th.
[21:58.840 --> 22:01.880]  That's what knows, you know, I don't have anything to get ready for.
[22:01.880 --> 22:06.040]  I was just telling me when it was ready.
[22:06.040 --> 22:10.760]  You know, I'm just throwing things out there. Do you think anything was rushed on the dry?
[22:10.760 --> 22:17.880]  I mean, I'm just asking and I don't want growers out there to go nuts because it happens to everybody like, yeah, man.
[22:17.880 --> 22:22.760]  And so we're asking questions here. Yeah, man. You ask, you ask away, dude.
[22:22.760 --> 22:28.600]  So, yes, I think, you know, now that we've taken a step back, always, you know, of course, hindsight's 2020.
[22:28.600 --> 22:45.160]  But now that we've taken a step back and we really look at it, you know, is that November 12th deadline enough time for somebody to properly dry cure and, you know, make shelf stable outdoor cannabis?
[22:45.160 --> 22:48.360]  You know, now that we're looking at it, I think it's tough, man.
[22:48.360 --> 22:55.480]  And, you know, and then we're asking them, you know, this year where it got a little where it also got a little bit cloudy is, you know,
[22:55.480 --> 23:02.760]  originally our judges were going to take the two weeks on sun grown to make their picks of the top 15, which would have gone to Gangier.
[23:02.760 --> 23:08.200]  Well, as it as it stood, we didn't have top 15. We only we didn't have 15 in each of those categories.
[23:08.200 --> 23:16.040]  And so when we had those other judge backs that, you know, and all that flower that sat for two weeks for Gangier isn't something that we normally do.
[23:16.040 --> 23:22.440]  Normally, our judges would get it. But yeah, I mean, I think looking and we're always going to look inside.
[23:22.440 --> 23:28.360]  But I think looking at that, yeah, I think that if we were rushing it, you know, and I don't I don't know what the answer is right now.
[23:28.360 --> 23:33.240]  You know, obviously we're sitting here looking. Do we do we back the event up? That's doesn't work very good.
[23:33.240 --> 23:38.560]  Do we you know, do we have another award show? Maybe.
[23:38.560 --> 23:42.800]  But I think it definitely didn't help matters at all.
[23:42.800 --> 23:46.600]  And we're definitely going to look to, you know, to see what we can do to change that.
[23:46.600 --> 23:49.920]  And and like I said, we're we're we're super easy to get a hold of.
[23:49.920 --> 23:53.440]  And so anybody wants to call with an opinion, we're we're all ears to hear it.
[23:53.440 --> 23:57.760]  So, but yeah, I was thinking about it. Yeah, I was kind of thinking about it.
[23:57.760 --> 24:06.440]  If I was in your shoes, you know, thinking about the outdoor and I was like, if I wanted my outdoor to really be just like the competition needs to be like, right.
[24:06.440 --> 24:11.200]  Like today, now, you know, I mean, it gave me time to harvest.
[24:11.200 --> 24:21.280]  It may be first couple of weeks of December, obviously you can't go into Christmas, but first couple of weeks of December probably may be the ideal for, you know, judging outdoor.
[24:21.280 --> 24:28.960]  And then I'm not trying to, you know, just turn it to that, but we're trying to give options that are going to make it better in the future.
[24:28.960 --> 24:34.800]  Yeah, absolutely. Well, you hit a good point, too, you know, with the big buds or was it bucked down or not?
[24:34.800 --> 24:39.760]  And I know a lot of these entries, they came with their COAs on these COAs.
[24:39.760 --> 24:44.480]  Is it standard practice for them to list moisture content of the flowers?
[24:44.480 --> 24:57.560]  Yeah, that's another thing we found and it's not across the board, but most, if not all, most of them, I think all but one or two were above 10% and a lot of them were at 14.7.
[24:57.560 --> 25:09.160]  And, you know, that's another thing we've all been sitting back and talking to different, you know, labs and different people about all this is, you know, that's kind of an inherent problem just in our testing SOPs.
[25:09.160 --> 25:11.640]  What's the limit in Oklahoma?
[25:11.640 --> 25:13.240]  15.
[25:13.240 --> 25:21.120]  So they're pushing that. That's the guy to be, especially like you wouldn't want to be 15 and go into a jar for two weeks.
[25:21.120 --> 25:21.880]  Exactly.
[25:21.880 --> 25:25.040]  You know what I mean? I'm just saying.
[25:25.040 --> 25:26.800]  Yeah, no, absolutely not.
[25:26.800 --> 25:37.720]  It'd be interesting, you know, the scientific method just to duplicate that, you know, find some 14.7% moisture levels, put it in a jar and just see what happens there.
[25:37.720 --> 25:40.800]  That's, you know, something else that could be done as well.
[25:40.800 --> 25:44.160]  But I think we kind of uniformly agree that's pretty high.
[25:44.160 --> 25:46.160]  Yeah, it's pretty high.
[25:46.160 --> 25:48.000]  Hmm.
[25:48.000 --> 25:51.960]  Is there, do you guys have basically like, do you know what receipts mean?
[25:51.960 --> 25:53.960]  Like, do you guys have anything to back this up?
[25:53.960 --> 25:59.520]  Because there were a lot of, there was a lot of quotes saying like, all right, we sent picture samples.
[25:59.520 --> 26:02.000]  Some of that was brought up during the Adam Dunn show.
[26:02.000 --> 26:05.800]  And then to be honest, it didn't seem like that was true.
[26:05.800 --> 26:14.960]  And so I was wondering, like, on the show, have you reached out to each farmer since then, sent them their sample photo and all that kind of stuff?
[26:14.960 --> 26:15.440]  Oh, yeah.
[26:15.440 --> 26:24.560]  And is the reason why we haven't seen it publicly because of an agreement of privacy with the growers?
[26:24.560 --> 26:26.760]  Because the public loves their pictures.
[26:26.760 --> 26:27.360]  That's easy.
[26:27.360 --> 26:31.200]  But there's also a confidentiality sometimes between business.
[26:31.200 --> 26:34.120]  There's been no agreements made.
[26:34.120 --> 26:38.000]  I just, we never wanted to point our finger at the growers that failed.
[26:38.000 --> 26:43.760]  It was never our intention to drag this thing out and drag them into the public eye and do all that.
[26:43.760 --> 26:48.240]  And I believe Gangier has published a link to those pictures.
[26:48.240 --> 26:49.960]  We have not.
[26:49.960 --> 26:51.400]  We have, we actually did.
[26:51.400 --> 26:53.560]  We immediately sent all of those pictures.
[26:53.560 --> 26:56.680]  We started Monday sending all those pictures.
[26:56.680 --> 27:00.040]  And then we got a threat and were forced to kind of take a step back.
[27:00.040 --> 27:05.520]  But I think it was Wednesday I went back and sent the remainder of the pictures to those contestants.
[27:05.520 --> 27:07.080]  We've had several contestants reach out.
[27:07.080 --> 27:08.680]  I had one reach out today.
[27:08.680 --> 27:10.920]  We went and got the sample again.
[27:10.920 --> 27:14.520]  I grabbed my jeweler's loop and found bugs and a bunch of webs in it.
[27:14.520 --> 27:20.720]  And I said, I don't have a digital microscope, but I'm going to go buy one and we will send my pictures to them.
[27:20.720 --> 27:21.880]  But yes, absolutely.
[27:21.880 --> 27:26.680]  Pictures were taken and sent to the growers as fast as I could.
[27:26.680 --> 27:28.640]  Now, here's a question for you.
[27:28.640 --> 27:40.480]  You know, as a smoker, a connoisseur, you know, as we all are now, when y'all are breaking these down, putting the samples together, that person should have seen something.
[27:40.480 --> 27:42.160]  No, no.
[27:42.160 --> 27:44.240]  There again, we've got a bag.
[27:44.240 --> 27:46.240]  You've got a guy that's got tweezers in his hand.
[27:46.240 --> 27:51.560]  We're trying our very best because, I mean, we're looking at trichome intactness, you know, trichome maturity.
[27:51.560 --> 27:55.800]  We're looking at a lot of stuff that where we don't want to knock a bunch of shit off the buds.
[27:55.800 --> 27:58.480]  And so, A, we're super careful doing that.
[27:58.480 --> 28:00.120]  Should we do better?
[28:00.120 --> 28:01.680]  We're looking at that again.
[28:01.680 --> 28:05.360]  But, you know, there again, this wasn't widespread powdery mildew, right?
[28:05.360 --> 28:15.560]  I mean, this is stuff where you break a node off and you look down into the bud and you see the webs or you see the mold growing, you know, pretty close down by the bract and where the stem meets.
[28:15.560 --> 28:20.960]  This isn't surface mold that we found or surface contaminants for the most part, you know.
[28:20.960 --> 28:27.360]  Some of the bugs were, but most of it's found inside, more indicative of something that grew around a moist stem.
[28:27.960 --> 28:32.640]  And just as standard procedure in a lot of these rooms, were you wearing the suits?
[28:32.640 --> 28:36.960]  Were you wearing gloves, hair nets, these types of things?
[28:36.960 --> 28:38.440]  We did not have gloves.
[28:38.440 --> 28:39.720]  We did not have suits on.
[28:39.720 --> 28:41.040]  We did have gloves on.
[28:41.040 --> 28:45.240]  So we are again, we're looking at that SOP and we'll go from there.
[28:45.240 --> 28:50.000]  But no, all clarity, no, we didn't have white Tyvek suits on.
[28:50.000 --> 28:54.840]  But we did have rubber gloves, new rubber gloves and alcohol.
[28:54.840 --> 28:57.080]  Like I said, it's never been a problem before.
[28:57.080 --> 29:01.000]  And so it was, you know, we're trying to get them in and get them out as fast as we can.
[29:01.000 --> 29:02.280]  But should we have suits on?
[29:02.720 --> 29:03.320]  Maybe so.
[29:03.840 --> 29:15.760]  Hey, one thing, though, I think looking forward is like if the gangier, if that was your guy, whoever your guy was, if they were there on the intake side.
[29:15.920 --> 29:17.880]  No, gangier wasn't there on intake.
[29:17.880 --> 29:21.640]  No, but that's what I'm trying to I'm giving you ideas to make this thing better.
[29:21.880 --> 29:22.240]  Sure.
[29:22.280 --> 29:29.200]  In the future, now have your guy or whoever that person is a group, you know, testers in on the intake side.
[29:29.200 --> 29:31.120]  Hey, guys, is it coming in perfect?
[29:31.120 --> 29:32.040]  Boom, boom, boom.
[29:32.440 --> 29:34.200]  You know, let's take it to that step.
[29:34.200 --> 29:39.560]  But that that'll avoid, you know how it is if you're a construction, you want to avoid any questions with things.
[29:39.560 --> 29:41.320]  You want to make sure everything's covered.
[29:41.320 --> 29:46.000]  All things are, you know, no error can be, you know, assigned to anyone.
[29:46.040 --> 29:46.880]  You know, yeah.
[29:46.920 --> 29:49.200]  Even even more so in competition, I think.
[29:49.200 --> 29:50.000]  Yeah, exactly.
[29:51.000 --> 30:00.200]  And to go one step further, you know, creepy big brother, every single cannabis facility I've been in has to have cameras covering every angle of every room.
[30:00.240 --> 30:02.800]  I'm sure the intake is there somewhere.
[30:03.240 --> 30:09.200]  We yeah, we I don't think that there's cameras on that intake, but that was brought up in our meeting the other day.
[30:09.200 --> 30:11.480]  Do we do we video record the whole thing?
[30:11.480 --> 30:13.160]  And I think that's a pretty viable option.
[30:13.840 --> 30:17.240]  Oklahoma is not real stringent on what on camera usage.
[30:17.320 --> 30:22.600]  You know, like Colorado, you get up in Colorado and every it all it's all hooked to their network and it has to be on every square inch.
[30:22.880 --> 30:24.400]  Oklahoma doesn't have to do that.
[30:24.400 --> 30:29.080]  You know, of course, the dispensary has got cameras for security, but I don't believe I'll ask yet.
[30:29.720 --> 30:31.560]  But I don't believe they were they were there.
[30:31.560 --> 30:33.840]  But it's definitely something that we need to look at doing.
[30:34.680 --> 30:45.520]  What's your thoughts on possibly having the grower bring the 12 samples or bring the 14 with my own little seal and then crack them and do it now?
[30:45.520 --> 30:47.840]  There's no absolutely.
[30:47.840 --> 30:50.800]  And so that's that's something that Greg brought up right off the bat.
[30:50.800 --> 30:54.160]  And people people have you know, we've talked about that before.
[30:54.160 --> 30:59.280]  Do you you know, do you come and pick up the jars, take them back and then, you know, this and that?
[30:59.280 --> 31:05.120]  And I haven't done it in the past, mainly because it's such a logistical pain in the ass.
[31:05.160 --> 31:08.720]  But I think definitely next year we are going to give that option.
[31:08.720 --> 31:17.880]  And so I think, you know, kind of just what we've talked about here lately is having all the jars ready where they can come pick them up and say, hey, you guys put them in there.
[31:17.880 --> 31:22.520]  We can get some of that tape that goes over the jar that when you peel it off, it leaves the mess.
[31:22.920 --> 31:24.720]  We can have a note in there to any of the judges.
[31:24.720 --> 31:28.240]  Hey, if you see any of these jars that have been tampered with, let us know immediately.
[31:29.120 --> 31:34.560]  And yeah, and just have have all this stuff available a few weeks before where everybody can just, you know, come get it.
[31:34.560 --> 31:36.920]  And I think I can get it, you know, in three or four cities.
[31:36.920 --> 31:38.520]  So to make that a little bit easier.
[31:38.800 --> 31:41.120]  But yeah, I mean, I think that takes a whole lot away from it.
[31:41.560 --> 31:44.520]  Oh, yeah. Rusty Nail said and an extra one for testing.
[31:44.520 --> 31:45.720]  So you have the yeah.
[31:45.720 --> 31:48.680]  Well, for the judges and the 13 for the tester.
[31:48.800 --> 31:50.760]  Yeah. But I'll need another one for my case, too.
[31:50.760 --> 31:53.680]  We'll need the big, pretty one for my display cases, too.
[31:54.040 --> 31:55.960]  And I need it for me and Greg, too.
[31:56.000 --> 31:57.320]  So that's fair.
[31:57.320 --> 32:00.440]  And that also, you know, it also kind of guides that grower.
[32:00.440 --> 32:03.600]  And this is not blaming the grower, Chad, to chill out.
[32:03.640 --> 32:07.120]  So there's also guys to grow into bucking that sample on down,
[32:07.880 --> 32:12.000]  breaking that flower on down to the point, you know, where it fits in those small jars.
[32:12.040 --> 32:17.280]  You know, I mean, not because you're not you're not getting just on the big fat cola.
[32:17.280 --> 32:19.440]  Right. This is not that kind of competition.
[32:19.440 --> 32:24.520]  So you're not going to get the brownie points because you grew a monster, you know, donkey.
[32:24.560 --> 32:25.440]  You know, I mean, yeah.
[32:25.440 --> 32:26.720]  You don't want me breaking it down.
[32:26.720 --> 32:29.080]  We always we hate it, you know, and Indore does it, too.
[32:29.080 --> 32:32.920]  And it really annoys us when we get those big, chunky nugs because we don't want to.
[32:33.240 --> 32:36.480]  Now we're touching it and handling it and really, really messing with it.
[32:39.400 --> 32:45.440]  I think I think especially as this continues, one of the biggest issues from more of like the home growers
[32:46.720 --> 32:52.720]  and moving forward and maybe even seeing kind of like where things are going for maybe, you know, they know a buddy that entered this.
[32:53.000 --> 32:55.800]  Obviously, you had to be in metric to be a part of this.
[32:56.520 --> 33:01.560]  And for the outdoor, 10 of those individuals failed out of out of 12.
[33:02.120 --> 33:06.960]  And when you think about that from a from a standpoint, there's an anomaly there.
[33:07.280 --> 33:14.560]  And I think kind of going deeper into this kind of stuff, understanding how you guys actually took into this.
[33:14.960 --> 33:17.200]  I mean, I don't know if you can be as detailed.
[33:17.400 --> 33:20.840]  You said almost instantly none of it was was videotaped.
[33:21.960 --> 33:29.720]  So so we'd really like to understand how that is, because if someone's putting up three seventy five and they're two ounces and their time,
[33:30.440 --> 33:34.200]  it's really more their time and their labor that's going to cost more of those entrants.
[33:34.440 --> 33:38.760]  And because of the way that it was handled, people feel a certain way about that.
[33:39.000 --> 33:47.720]  And I'm just the messenger trying to create that bridge, because if we don't have a national contest, I don't really know what's going to happen to the small time individual.
[33:47.720 --> 33:56.680]  Like if we can't all kind of just hang out and be a part of stuff, you know, that's that will die out, whether whether people see that now or in the future.
[33:56.680 --> 34:03.040]  So if the community dies off, there's really nothing else for the small time individual to do.
[34:03.240 --> 34:18.920]  And it seemed like your cup, even though it was still a commercial based, you were still kind of more blue collar, if you will, individuals that hopefully we're probably doing this with, you know, just about as much money as they have, you know, with everything just going all in, if you will.
[34:19.200 --> 34:21.240]  And so I went double all in.
[34:22.200 --> 34:31.240]  So what so they're feeling on their side of things, that the way that that was handled, they would just like to understand a little more transparency of how it was taken in.
[34:31.400 --> 34:38.400]  How did you make sure that, you know, if everything had already passed, how does 10 out of 12 how fail like that?
[34:39.440 --> 34:42.000]  Well, I think I don't think that's much of an anomaly.
[34:43.520 --> 34:44.360]  It's sun grown.
[34:44.480 --> 34:49.120]  You know, we're talking about stuff that is inherently has mold on it.
[34:49.120 --> 34:51.520]  I mean, you just you absolutely can't get away from it.
[34:52.640 --> 35:00.680]  You know, I as far as an anomaly goes and testing and statistics go to me, it doesn't sound too far out.
[35:00.720 --> 35:04.960]  But there again, I had I had a lab fail 50 of them two years ago.
[35:05.120 --> 35:09.600]  So, you know, we all know that I'm not saying that anybody doctored any tests.
[35:09.600 --> 35:14.680]  And I sure as hell not trying to talk down on any of the sun grown growers in Oklahoma.
[35:14.720 --> 35:23.160]  But, you know, we have to we have to do some certain things to get stuff to you know, they're turning in seven grams for a 10 for a 10 pound batch.
[35:23.680 --> 35:38.000]  And so to say that this seven grams passed their testing and then, you know, three or four weeks later, it had grown mold, especially if we're talking about it being in enclosed environment, you know, in sealed jars and all that stuff.
[35:38.000 --> 35:39.600]  I don't see it as a giant anomaly.
[35:40.320 --> 35:42.120]  Do I see it is not my problem?
[35:42.120 --> 35:44.520]  No. I mean, I see it as like like we've been talking about.
[35:44.520 --> 35:46.320]  We really kind of need to look at that process.
[35:47.000 --> 35:54.360]  And there again, just for that, we refunded all the entries for sun grown this year just because I think that the time frame was shit.
[35:55.040 --> 36:01.040]  Good, good, because that was one of my concerns that I haven't heard yet is is just, you know, the refunds.
[36:01.800 --> 36:03.320]  But I just want to get back to your point there.
[36:03.320 --> 36:10.560]  You know, sun grown, it's inherently known that, you know, mold pathogens, contaminants, all of this does exist.
[36:10.560 --> 36:11.720]  It's just part of the game.
[36:11.960 --> 36:22.280]  But the problem with that statement is that these past testing and it wasn't just through one lab where, OK, maybe they just, you know, rubber stamped everything.
[36:22.280 --> 36:23.520]  It was multiple labs.
[36:23.520 --> 36:30.400]  So it's kind of reasonable to believe that it at least left their hands clean.
[36:30.400 --> 36:37.320]  And as a grower, my batch that's getting sampled is coming from my batch that I'm submitting for the contest.
[36:37.320 --> 36:41.320]  It's not, you know, the cherry picked cola and then I submit you the lowers.
[36:41.320 --> 36:44.760]  It's it's it's all the same thing because I want to know.
[36:45.840 --> 36:48.320]  So I guess, you know, we could just kind of.
[36:48.400 --> 36:52.480]  Yeah, it is inherent, but they all pass for multiple different labs.
[36:53.000 --> 36:58.120]  Where in the chain of custody is it possible?
[36:58.240 --> 37:03.360]  You know, there's something in the process, to Peter's point, that could have been the point of entry for contaminants.
[37:03.360 --> 37:11.680]  Has anything like that been identified or is it just still kind of like, well, it was clean from them and then it got moldy here?
[37:12.040 --> 37:14.240]  We mentioned the moisture level, but.
[37:15.320 --> 37:18.800]  You know, was there anything that could be identified?
[37:19.040 --> 37:26.080]  Everybody dropped off their sample at the same facility in which we did the the the the judge backs.
[37:26.720 --> 37:32.400]  If you guys were to walk into the lettuce bar, it's one of the cleanest dispensaries you've ever been in.
[37:33.560 --> 37:35.480]  And so, you know, I saw a meme the other day.
[37:35.480 --> 37:36.520]  It was actually pretty funny.
[37:36.760 --> 37:43.560]  That was a horse barn is where I do my my sampling, but quite, quite, quite the opposite.
[37:44.080 --> 37:47.920]  It's done right behind the wall where everybody walked in and took them.
[37:48.560 --> 37:51.960]  We just you know, we just haven't had this problem before, Chad.
[37:51.960 --> 37:54.440]  And so now it's time to address it, you know.
[37:54.760 --> 37:56.720]  Yeah, and we just didn't know to address it before.
[37:56.720 --> 38:10.800]  I think I think as far as it goes with with all this being said, you know, when we take these samples in, we're sitting we're sitting in the area that those samples are being they're not ever brought out of there.
[38:10.960 --> 38:14.120]  So the contestants bring those samples to us directly.
[38:14.600 --> 38:22.840]  They bring them right there and drop them off at the spot that they can see with their own eyes where that product or that sample is being made up.
[38:23.160 --> 38:24.360]  We take the jars.
[38:25.000 --> 38:27.240]  We don't allow people to look at them.
[38:27.480 --> 38:28.800]  We don't roll them around.
[38:28.800 --> 38:29.760]  We don't shake them.
[38:29.760 --> 38:30.760]  We don't open them.
[38:30.960 --> 38:32.120]  We put them on a shelf.
[38:32.360 --> 38:44.200]  And then the moment we have the opportunity at this was what, three days later from the time we started to the time we finished, we started making judge kits and we opened the one kit at a time.
[38:44.880 --> 38:46.200]  The one one jar at a time.
[38:46.200 --> 38:49.080]  Make the kit, put them in the boxes, close that up and put it back on.
[38:49.080 --> 38:55.720]  So is it realistic to think that they can hand in product that didn't have contaminants mold?
[38:55.800 --> 39:00.200]  Okay, because you can't do anything about the bug, the bug droppings and the webbing that we've also seen.
[39:00.880 --> 39:08.600]  But to think that something could grow in two weeks with a moisture content of 14 and a half and it's sitting in a jar for two weeks.
[39:08.600 --> 39:10.680]  It's RSOP not to mess with that.
[39:10.680 --> 39:15.160]  But we want to turn that to the judges exactly the way that you turned it to us.
[39:15.160 --> 39:21.640]  Now, if it's set there with moisture in the stems at 14% for two weeks, is it realistic that things could grow?
[39:21.640 --> 39:22.160]  Yeah.
[39:22.600 --> 39:31.800]  You know, so really everything all boils back to how do we allow these outdoor growers, because the one we had the issue with, how do we allow them more time?
[39:32.000 --> 39:45.040]  Because we believe that they need a little more time to properly dry and cure that product and make it shelf stable so that when they hand it to us and we do exactly what we tell them we're going to do by not opening the jar.
[39:45.160 --> 39:47.320]  Open it and not manhandling their samples.
[39:48.560 --> 39:50.200]  And it's sitting on a shelf for two weeks.
[39:50.280 --> 39:52.040]  It can withstand that.
[39:52.520 --> 39:55.400]  So RSOP is to not mess with it.
[39:55.560 --> 39:55.840]  Yeah.
[39:55.840 --> 39:57.680]  And that's a double edged sword there.
[39:57.680 --> 40:02.880]  Because if you would have touched it and handled it and did all that, then that opens you to a complaint.
[40:02.880 --> 40:03.400]  Exactly.
[40:03.400 --> 40:10.240]  And to be perfectly fair, it's not your job to finish the process of curing or drying this bug.
[40:10.240 --> 40:11.320]  It should be turned in.
[40:11.960 --> 40:16.160]  You know, we've talked about the time adjustments, but that's not your job.
[40:17.240 --> 40:24.160]  I also do like the fact that the people submitting it were in the room, in the area, they were allowed to see it.
[40:24.160 --> 40:27.240]  So, you know, if anybody out there, you know, saw Mr.
[40:27.240 --> 40:29.000]  Ed in the corner, let us know.
[40:29.000 --> 40:35.400]  But that doesn't seem to be the case because I haven't heard anybody speak up and say, you know, there was Big Mac on the ground.
[40:35.400 --> 40:35.880]  Whatever.
[40:36.120 --> 40:36.720]  No, no.
[40:36.720 --> 40:38.560]  We could be cleaning that room before we do it.
[40:38.560 --> 40:41.840]  You know, you guys, we love this competition, Chad.
[40:41.840 --> 40:43.360]  You know, we really, really do.
[40:43.360 --> 40:44.760]  And we take a lot of pride in it.
[40:44.760 --> 40:49.480]  And we took as much care as we had thought to.
[40:49.480 --> 40:50.760]  You know, does that make sense?
[40:50.760 --> 40:53.800]  I don't want to take away from because we try really, really hard.
[40:54.640 --> 40:55.480]  But, you know, we can.
[40:55.480 --> 40:57.440]  Is there stuff we could have done to improve?
[40:57.600 --> 40:58.200]  Hell yeah.
[40:58.200 --> 41:00.160]  Are we going to take those steps next year?
[41:00.440 --> 41:01.040]  Heck yeah.
[41:01.080 --> 41:03.280]  You know, and I love the stuff with the Tyvek suits.
[41:03.280 --> 41:03.880]  I'm down.
[41:03.880 --> 41:04.560]  You know, I want to.
[41:04.560 --> 41:05.040]  I'm down.
[41:05.040 --> 41:07.320]  We want it to be as clean as it can be.
[41:07.440 --> 41:08.240]  No doubt about it.
[41:08.680 --> 41:09.320]  Yeah, I did.
[41:09.320 --> 41:15.720]  Um, I did have someone reach out to me too, and they said they were a judge and they said they saw it in their judge kit.
[41:15.880 --> 41:18.680]  They saw a couple of judges reach out and tell me they did.
[41:18.680 --> 41:19.360]  Yeah, I'm not.
[41:19.360 --> 41:22.760]  And they were very, and they were, this person was very not biased.
[41:22.760 --> 41:26.720]  They were actually not even happy with the way the guys did it.
[41:26.720 --> 41:30.280]  So they were actually not, you know, it wasn't even one of those type of tips.
[41:30.280 --> 41:31.440]  It was, it was straight up.
[41:31.440 --> 41:34.440]  And so, man, you know, look, shit can happen.
[41:34.440 --> 41:36.240]  I made a post about it.
[41:36.240 --> 41:37.760]  I even had a little bit in mind.
[41:37.760 --> 41:45.160]  It looked like it might've been a spider web, but whatever we, it's all, if you've grown outdoors, it's, you know, you've had some mold.
[41:45.320 --> 41:50.400]  I think, you know, I'm always looking to focus on moving forward.
[41:50.400 --> 41:53.520]  If I'm a grower, I'm going to do, I'm learning a few things right now.
[41:53.520 --> 41:55.080]  If I'm that Oklahoma grower.
[41:55.080 --> 42:00.640]  And if you've already done this and you know, all this, then this, this isn't for you, but I'm going to be bucking buzz down.
[42:00.640 --> 42:04.680]  I'm going to be, um, you know, really ensuring that I got that dry.
[42:04.680 --> 42:06.840]  I probably want to be a little overly dry.
[42:07.280 --> 42:15.960]  Um, then under basically, because I know the process now, I know this thing's going to have to go on a jar, sit and wait and go to a judge kit.
[42:16.320 --> 42:22.240]  So just, you know, looking at things that I can do as a grower, um, that's a benefit.
[42:22.240 --> 42:27.000]  And then the guys, you know, thinking about the things you guys can do on your end to kind of double that up.
[42:27.000 --> 42:30.000]  And now we start coming together and have a real solid cup.
[42:30.040 --> 42:30.840]  You know what I mean?
[42:31.280 --> 42:35.400]  I'm not one to say, all right, these guys have made a mistake or anybody made a mistake.
[42:35.840 --> 42:40.280]  Um, you know, that's it, you know, you kind of got to work through it.
[42:40.280 --> 42:45.840]  If, if you feel like the people are genuine and they're going to, you know, they're in it for the right reasons.
[42:46.160 --> 42:48.160]  Um, support that growth, man.
[42:48.160 --> 42:50.680]  Because, you know, if you think about it, people had to invest.
[42:50.680 --> 42:54.400]  If I start a cup and I'm, I'm want to invest, right.
[42:55.080 --> 42:56.800]  That's money going to our industry.
[42:56.800 --> 42:59.400]  Now, maybe I'm not sure who to get a judge.
[42:59.400 --> 43:02.240]  I hire a judge and now I have a debacle.
[43:02.240 --> 43:10.720]  Well, fuck, I had good intentions, but some other person, you know, got kind of this shit stirred up and kind of got it off to the wrong track.
[43:10.720 --> 43:18.440]  I think if it had only been, cause you said 50 failed before, if it had only been, Hey, some guys failed, whatever, whatever.
[43:18.800 --> 43:19.920]  Moving on.
[43:20.400 --> 43:21.320]  That's a fine.
[43:21.320 --> 43:25.760]  I think where the biggest problem came where, you know, kind of people felt insulted about it.
[43:26.120 --> 43:31.680]  And we all know that now we're, we're kind of moving on, but, um, SOPs, man, standard operating
[43:31.720 --> 43:33.680]  procedures, absolutely.
[43:33.880 --> 43:36.800]  And you guys kind of got a year to kind of lock that in too.
[43:36.800 --> 43:43.680]  Now, I just want to say, you know, anybody watching you guys were, we're the, I'm the easiest guy to get ahold of on the planet, you know?
[43:43.680 --> 43:47.520]  And so we always answer emails and we stay on top of everybody's stuff.
[43:47.520 --> 43:51.320]  And if you guys have an idea, please reach out and just talk to us.
[43:51.360 --> 43:53.800]  We're open, you know, we're around and this is what we do.
[43:53.840 --> 43:55.440]  This is what we do full time now.
[43:55.880 --> 43:58.240]  And so if you've got a better suggestion, man, we're all for it.
[43:59.000 --> 43:59.920]  Make a community.
[43:59.920 --> 44:07.000]  You know, we, we take a lot of this, uh, soil education, a lot of this plant growth from crowdsourcing because we can't do it all.
[44:07.000 --> 44:08.880]  And we're kind of a collective in that matter.
[44:09.280 --> 44:12.600]  So it's important to share if you have opinions.
[44:12.720 --> 44:18.000]  And I do want to just highlight real quick because a couple of people are in the chat, you know, let's hear from the farmers.
[44:18.040 --> 44:19.040]  I do agree.
[44:19.080 --> 44:20.160]  Want to hear from the farmers?
[44:20.600 --> 44:21.720]  Absolute you guys.
[44:21.840 --> 44:27.720]  I was thinking, you know, there's that old saying that there's always three, you know, three sides to every story.
[44:28.000 --> 44:29.920]  And just this last week, I'm like, you know what?
[44:30.480 --> 44:31.880]  That was written before the internet.
[44:31.880 --> 44:35.360]  So there's really four sides to every story because the internet's got their side.
[44:36.600 --> 44:43.240]  But I bring that up because, yeah, we had Brandon rust and we had some of the farmers involved on last week.
[44:43.280 --> 44:43.880]  Check that out.
[44:43.880 --> 44:45.160]  The Brian and Marco show.
[44:47.040 --> 44:47.400]  Yep.
[44:47.520 --> 44:50.120]  And this definitely isn't the end of the conversation.
[44:50.120 --> 44:51.200]  Everybody out there.
[44:52.000 --> 44:59.760]  We today wanted to create an opportunity for these people to address some of the questions without getting yelled over.
[45:00.360 --> 45:03.400]  I mean, Brian, I thank you for doing this.
[45:03.400 --> 45:04.720]  But yeah, everybody in chat.
[45:05.080 --> 45:07.040]  We're not keeping the farmers out today.
[45:07.040 --> 45:10.520]  We're not, you know, being shy like that.
[45:10.880 --> 45:11.720]  This is a part two.
[45:11.720 --> 45:14.080]  Guys, go check part one and there'll be a part three.
[45:14.080 --> 45:15.720]  So the conversation will continue.
[45:16.000 --> 45:20.560]  But please keep giving us your input and the questions because that's how we learn.
[45:20.680 --> 45:22.640]  So I'll turn it back to you guys.
[45:23.280 --> 45:24.120]  Exactly.
[45:24.600 --> 45:25.840]  Yeah, it's all about learning.
[45:26.760 --> 45:31.040]  Well, I mean, the heart the heart and soul of any event is if the community is going to support it.
[45:31.080 --> 45:36.320]  And if you know, if they don't, you might not feel it after the first year.
[45:36.320 --> 45:39.880]  But I promise as things progress, you know, you will start to see that.
[45:40.120 --> 45:50.080]  And so I think moving forward, as long as you guys continue to be as transparent, when you're given the olive branch to to come on a platform that, again, has no reason to.
[45:50.680 --> 45:57.080]  To feel on one way or the other, you know, it speaks volumes when you're able to come in and talk about those things.
[45:57.080 --> 46:04.720]  And of course, some people feel a certain way about how those things were handled, apologizing for it twice now on two different platforms.
[46:05.240 --> 46:09.040]  And moving forward, you said that you are refunding everybody.
[46:09.040 --> 46:18.000]  So I think those are the kind of things that that getting out the community, I think, would probably start to, I don't know, back off a little bit, I guess.
[46:18.000 --> 46:23.200]  So I don't know how aggressive they've been, but they've been pretty aggressive, man, about finding out the truth on this.
[46:23.840 --> 46:28.280]  And again, I think it's because people gave, you know, gave a shit, give a shit, however they feel about it now.
[46:29.160 --> 46:31.240]  Rightfully so. Yeah.
[46:31.280 --> 46:32.760]  And we set out to be transparent.
[46:32.760 --> 46:35.480]  Like I said, you know, we were never dodging anything.
[46:35.480 --> 46:41.200]  If anybody saw this guy moving around Cowboy Cup, you would have given him two or three days off, too.
[46:41.600 --> 46:46.920]  And so, you know, like I said, and I think we would have been quicker to even come out.
[46:46.920 --> 46:49.880]  But it was like it really, you know, really kind of hit the fan.
[46:49.880 --> 46:54.960]  And we and we didn't really see it until, you know, you guys had your show and then we were like, oh, there's a problem.
[46:55.440 --> 46:59.960]  And so the flu the day after the event, we all started getting flu.
[46:59.960 --> 47:01.800]  And I mean, it was it was a rough time.
[47:01.800 --> 47:03.880]  Yeah. But like I said, I'm not here to make excuses.
[47:03.880 --> 47:06.640]  And but we also there was no hiding.
[47:06.640 --> 47:08.920]  We've always been we've always been transparent.
[47:08.960 --> 47:13.240]  You know, it's and anybody you talk to that really knows us will tell you the same.
[47:13.600 --> 47:15.160]  How big was the crowd this year?
[47:15.160 --> 47:18.800]  How many? Oh, man, I haven't got a I haven't got a ticket count yet.
[47:18.800 --> 47:21.880]  I haven't even got through the end of all the financials yet
[47:22.960 --> 47:24.600]  to kind of really figure out where we're at.
[47:24.600 --> 47:26.120]  My best guess.
[47:28.160 --> 47:30.200]  Ten thousand over a couple of days, probably.
[47:31.000 --> 47:33.040]  I don't think it was a whole lot higher than that.
[47:33.040 --> 47:35.960]  I was kind of hoping we'd hit twelve, five or fifteen this year.
[47:35.960 --> 47:37.600]  I don't think we did.
[47:37.600 --> 47:39.280]  But it was definitely bigger than last year.
[47:39.280 --> 47:41.800]  And I think last year's numbers was right at seventy five hundred.
[47:42.120 --> 47:44.600]  OK, so we're seeing the rest of the city.
[47:44.600 --> 47:49.440]  Man, we had people from all over and had a really good time.
[47:49.440 --> 47:50.640]  We burnt the place to the ground.
[47:50.640 --> 47:56.400]  So tumbleweeds is just, you know, literally get to burn that place to the ground.
[47:56.400 --> 47:58.920]  And so it's a it's a really cool environment.
[47:59.080 --> 48:01.200]  You guys need to come out and check it out next year for sure.
[48:01.760 --> 48:02.800]  Yeah, definitely.
[48:02.800 --> 48:06.600]  I think I've heard some folks saying, you know, they're going to boycott
[48:06.600 --> 48:08.600]  and those kind of things, and I think that's fine.
[48:08.600 --> 48:13.120]  But I feel like, man, you know, I feel like if that you'll get that growth,
[48:13.120 --> 48:16.720]  if it's genuine and y'all are doing what y'all supposed to do in the community,
[48:16.720 --> 48:19.760]  because really this is I mean, y'all are trying to make this national,
[48:19.760 --> 48:22.080]  but this is kind of grassroots Oklahoma, right?
[48:22.080 --> 48:25.360]  All the contestants are Oklahoma only, correct?
[48:25.720 --> 48:26.400]  That's correct.
[48:26.400 --> 48:29.640]  Yeah. And I mean, he and I are both born and raised here.
[48:29.960 --> 48:32.680]  You know, we're we're we're Oklahoma through and through.
[48:32.680 --> 48:34.120]  We've never lived anywhere else.
[48:34.120 --> 48:38.440]  The last thing we want to do is damage anything to the state
[48:38.440 --> 48:42.200]  that we both basically pledged to raise our family in.
[48:42.320 --> 48:44.440]  You know, we love this place.
[48:44.440 --> 48:46.560]  And so I'll call it home.
[48:46.560 --> 48:48.400]  I'll never leave. I'll never leave Oklahoma.
[48:48.400 --> 48:49.720]  I've never been anywhere else.
[48:49.720 --> 48:51.160]  So that's what's up.
[48:51.160 --> 48:53.600]  Well, Chad's got the devil's advocate poppin.
[48:53.600 --> 48:56.080]  So devil's advocate here.
[48:57.080 --> 48:58.640]  Let's just be honest, guys.
[48:58.640 --> 49:02.320]  90 percent or more of the people who attended this
[49:03.120 --> 49:05.840]  probably don't even know, don't even really care.
[49:06.240 --> 49:09.960]  So sorry, devil's advocate point of view there.
[49:10.960 --> 49:12.280]  You know, and I don't know.
[49:12.280 --> 49:16.440]  We sure as hell want everybody to have a good time, you know, and the stuff
[49:16.440 --> 49:19.280]  with the award ceremony, you know, is pretty tragic.
[49:19.280 --> 49:21.640]  And like I said, we're just going to take a big, long look. But
[49:22.960 --> 49:25.080]  I think everybody that went had a goddamn good time.
[49:25.080 --> 49:29.600]  I mean, we had bands on five stages and badass classes.
[49:30.040 --> 49:32.800]  You know, it's really a cool environment.
[49:32.800 --> 49:37.920]  You know, it's kind of the old school Emerald Cup, you know, the 2014, 2015 feel.
[49:38.760 --> 49:42.800]  And Greg puts on a hell of a show and all of our vendors, you know, that
[49:43.240 --> 49:45.160]  we work really hard for the competition.
[49:45.160 --> 49:48.080]  But, you know, another the other thing we really work hard
[49:48.080 --> 49:51.200]  is to make sure vendors are happy, you know, and expectations are met.
[49:51.680 --> 49:54.640]  And so it means a lot to us for vendors to come back year after year.
[49:54.640 --> 49:57.240]  And we've had a lot a lot of them reach out to us and, you know,
[49:57.520 --> 49:59.320]  and have been real honest with us, too.
[49:59.320 --> 50:01.640]  You know, some of the stuff they saw and yeah, they you know, they could
[50:01.640 --> 50:04.200]  under understand, you know, that they could be upset.
[50:04.200 --> 50:05.800]  And we've we've talked a lot about it.
[50:05.800 --> 50:10.640]  But I think I think the at first, you know, you guys, honestly, I threw shit.
[50:10.640 --> 50:13.200]  I don't like being called a liar.
[50:13.200 --> 50:14.680]  You know, I get I got upset.
[50:14.680 --> 50:16.920]  There's a lot of emotions, you know, that happen.
[50:16.920 --> 50:18.280]  And I get a call to liar every year.
[50:18.280 --> 50:20.160]  It's like, oh, I can sponsor one.
[50:20.160 --> 50:21.480]  Ooh, well, they didn't.
[50:21.480 --> 50:22.800]  And so that's calling me a liar.
[50:22.800 --> 50:26.120]  But and at some point I was like, dude, is it is a competition
[50:26.120 --> 50:29.440]  even ethical in itself, you know, and I don't I sure as hell didn't want to hurt
[50:29.440 --> 50:31.000]  the don't want to hurt the community.
[50:31.000 --> 50:34.400]  And if I'm hurting the community, I'll go back to doing construction.
[50:34.400 --> 50:36.680]  But I had you know, I have a big long conversation with Greg
[50:36.680 --> 50:39.720]  and a big long conversation with my wife and and team.
[50:39.720 --> 50:43.320]  And it's like we really do feel like we're the best for the job.
[50:43.320 --> 50:45.800]  I mean, are we the best cannabis judges in the world?
[50:45.880 --> 50:46.600]  Probably not.
[50:46.600 --> 50:50.840]  But when it really comes down to us not having a dog in the fight,
[50:50.840 --> 50:54.280]  really feel like we know that, you know, we sleep good at night,
[50:54.280 --> 50:58.520]  knowing that people didn't pay a sponsorship and win a win a buckle.
[50:58.920 --> 51:01.000]  You know, I don't there's not a whole lot of companies out there,
[51:01.000 --> 51:04.200]  I think, that can stand behind that and do it for as long as we have
[51:04.200 --> 51:05.800]  and pledge to continue to do it.
[51:05.800 --> 51:08.960]  You know, and I've always said that as soon as somebody finds out that,
[51:08.960 --> 51:12.440]  you know, has proof that somebody bought a buckle and, you know,
[51:12.640 --> 51:14.320]  this day and age, that'd be easy.
[51:14.320 --> 51:15.760]  The rest of it goes to shit.
[51:15.760 --> 51:16.960]  It's really not worth anything.
[51:16.960 --> 51:19.560]  And so, you know, why why enter a competition
[51:19.560 --> 51:22.760]  where even if you do win, the prize is worthless?
[51:22.800 --> 51:25.080]  And so, you know, we're just going to continue on that
[51:25.560 --> 51:28.240]  and just try to try to be better and we're going to do it for another year.
[51:28.240 --> 51:30.920]  And like you said, you know, they'll tell us one way or the other
[51:30.920 --> 51:33.640]  whether they want us to do it again. So.
[51:33.640 --> 51:34.560]  Yeah. Yeah.
[51:34.560 --> 51:36.920]  Those people will speak one way or the other.
[51:37.000 --> 51:38.760]  So, yeah. Yeah.
[51:38.760 --> 51:42.920]  And now that I could come back from being the devil's advocate there,
[51:43.760 --> 51:45.880]  because really, that's probably the truth.
[51:45.880 --> 51:49.480]  But the reason why it was so impactful
[51:49.480 --> 51:52.120]  and why there is such an emotional response,
[51:52.120 --> 51:54.840]  whether it's one or whether it's 10
[51:56.520 --> 51:59.360]  a, you know, the pride, pride gets hurt in that.
[51:59.360 --> 52:01.800]  But the business aspect.
[52:02.080 --> 52:07.160]  And this is something that is, you know, when you mess with people's money,
[52:07.160 --> 52:10.080]  that's where people get emotional and one person is too many.
[52:10.600 --> 52:13.800]  So that's where a lot of people.
[52:14.240 --> 52:17.440]  Well, there's I see three different areas where people have problems.
[52:17.600 --> 52:19.920]  One is the Ghanji's involvement
[52:20.120 --> 52:23.560]  and their suspect timing announcement with Cure Relief.
[52:24.080 --> 52:28.680]  Two was the intake process, which is what you're actually able to speak on
[52:28.920 --> 52:31.000]  and have spoken on.
[52:31.000 --> 52:35.680]  And then three is the announcement, because the announcement was where
[52:36.320 --> 52:41.960]  things got really sideways, because that can have a financial impact
[52:41.960 --> 52:43.880]  on a lot of these businesses and they're struggling.
[52:43.880 --> 52:46.560]  So that's why I think there's been such an uproar.
[52:46.560 --> 52:50.000]  And you weren't the ones who made the announcement.
[52:50.600 --> 52:57.000]  But where we've heard or seen is the decision and the timing
[52:57.000 --> 53:00.480]  of when to make it and how did it not get relayed?
[53:00.480 --> 53:04.000]  Because, again, you didn't write the script for the person up on stage.
[53:04.000 --> 53:06.240]  But that is the other area.
[53:06.240 --> 53:09.040]  So I don't want to toss all of that on you, because, again,
[53:09.160 --> 53:10.400]  you didn't write the script.
[53:10.400 --> 53:13.600]  But is there something that can be improved or what happened there
[53:13.600 --> 53:17.440]  in the lack of messaging to where it actually came out on the stage?
[53:19.320 --> 53:22.800]  I've apologized for that, and I think that's what I feel the worst about
[53:23.680 --> 53:24.920]  and something I'm going to have.
[53:24.920 --> 53:27.240]  I'm going to have to look at
[53:27.320 --> 53:29.000]  and think about for a long time.
[53:29.000 --> 53:31.280]  Hindsight's 20-20, I think.
[53:31.280 --> 53:34.040]  But I can tell you, we didn't there was no ill intentions.
[53:34.480 --> 53:37.240]  Nobody nobody meant to do harm.
[53:38.160 --> 53:39.920]  You know, really only good.
[53:39.920 --> 53:41.880]  But we'll just have to look at that, you know.
[53:41.880 --> 53:44.720]  And like I said, you know, Chad, I've I've apologized for it.
[53:44.720 --> 53:47.880]  And like I said, I won't apologize for my SOPs.
[53:47.880 --> 53:49.080]  Now, can they be better? Yeah.
[53:49.080 --> 53:51.640]  But do I think that I that I somehow
[53:53.600 --> 53:54.960]  contaminated the samples?
[53:54.960 --> 53:56.480]  I really don't.
[53:56.480 --> 53:59.040]  I do think that the you know, like we talked about,
[53:59.040 --> 54:02.040]  the the time frame could be could be switched.
[54:02.040 --> 54:05.680]  But I think all you know, I think all in all, everybody had good intentions.
[54:06.000 --> 54:08.040]  Did it come out that way?
[54:08.320 --> 54:11.400]  You know, people have taken it how they've taken it.
[54:11.400 --> 54:13.640]  And so, you know, and then they have the right to do that.
[54:13.640 --> 54:15.520]  And so I appreciate that, too.
[54:15.520 --> 54:20.160]  You guys, how many how many how many people failed in each category?
[54:20.160 --> 54:22.960]  Because you challenged me kind of on that anonymously.
[54:24.400 --> 54:26.520]  To be honest, man, I mean, 10 out of 12.
[54:26.520 --> 54:29.680]  You don't you don't think like if these guys are in metric,
[54:29.760 --> 54:31.560]  these guys and girls are in metric.
[54:31.560 --> 54:34.160]  I would love to hear this like kind of this other stuff, man,
[54:34.160 --> 54:37.280]  because that that's the part that they're challenging you on.
[54:37.280 --> 54:40.040]  And to kind of dismiss it like that
[54:40.040 --> 54:42.160]  needs to be brought up again.
[54:42.160 --> 54:44.520]  Yeah, I never wanted that.
[54:44.520 --> 54:46.320]  I did I dismiss it? I didn't mean to.
[54:46.320 --> 54:48.720]  I sure didn't. I sure didn't mean to.
[54:48.720 --> 54:53.880]  Yeah. And so 10 of the 12 sun grown failed and seven of the eight
[54:55.760 --> 54:58.720]  sun grown light assists failed due to visual contamination.
[55:00.440 --> 55:04.320]  And you said that you've had 50 fail before.
[55:04.880 --> 55:06.440]  That was a lab test. Yeah.
[55:06.480 --> 55:10.120]  50. That was it was more than 52, I think.
[55:10.320 --> 55:13.440]  That's the thing that throws me off then, because like, yeah, you know,
[55:13.440 --> 55:16.360]  think about it. I didn't touch those guys that went right to the lab.
[55:16.440 --> 55:19.520]  I know I get that. But so, you know, what does the lab do?
[55:19.560 --> 55:20.360]  They just take a look.
[55:20.360 --> 55:23.800]  They get this sample, take a little pinch, throw it in their machine and whoop de
[55:23.800 --> 55:27.480]  whoop. I mean, I think, you know, for microbials, it's a plate test.
[55:27.480 --> 55:28.600]  And I'm not a scientist.
[55:28.600 --> 55:31.160]  So, again, I you know, I can't really speak to how they do all that.
[55:31.160 --> 55:33.400]  Right. Some sort of plate test.
[55:33.400 --> 55:35.640]  Was there was there any thought?
[55:35.640 --> 55:39.000]  I mean, it sounds like there was well, there was visual
[55:39.240 --> 55:43.520]  confirmation of contaminants and mold again, two separate things,
[55:43.680 --> 55:45.680]  both equal to fail.
[55:45.680 --> 55:48.600]  Was there any thought once this was identified by the gun
[55:48.600 --> 55:54.160]  G.A. to submit it for secondary lab testing, like another
[55:54.960 --> 55:56.680]  set of eyes, I guess?
[55:56.680 --> 55:58.760]  Yeah. No, it didn't. It did not come up.
[56:01.440 --> 56:04.240]  It was probably because if it was visible, Chad, if I'm like,
[56:04.240 --> 56:07.920]  Chad, look at this and you're like, it was it came down to them go, you know.
[56:08.440 --> 56:11.040]  Well, we so we like I said, we looked at it again.
[56:11.040 --> 56:14.200]  And then the question becomes, well, can we find a sample that's smokeable?
[56:14.200 --> 56:15.840]  Right. I mean, that's how it went.
[56:15.840 --> 56:17.680]  You know, that was the question that was raised.
[56:17.680 --> 56:20.160]  And, you know, I brought in Gange to do it.
[56:20.160 --> 56:24.640]  And so, you know, and like I said, it's all documented.
[56:24.680 --> 56:26.680]  I saw it myself. We brought in new samples.
[56:26.680 --> 56:27.560]  They found it again.
[56:28.600 --> 56:30.800]  And there again, like Greg said, it wasn't it wasn't all mold.
[56:30.800 --> 56:32.400]  A lot, you know, some of it was a lot.
[56:32.440 --> 56:34.560]  A lot of people are just saying like that.
[56:34.560 --> 56:38.680]  So it's not you know, I didn't add bugs, feces and webs to any of these.
[56:38.680 --> 56:41.360]  Now we're not saying that you're going in the wrong direction.
[56:41.400 --> 56:43.560]  Yeah, you're taking that the wrong way, bro.
[56:43.560 --> 56:47.800]  But a lot of people are more saying like, this is why you need Gange.
[56:47.800 --> 56:51.440]  Yeah. Does that mean you feel me like this?
[56:51.560 --> 56:53.720]  This is right. Yeah.
[56:53.760 --> 56:58.240]  Well, you know, we just yeah, we just thought, of course, the Gange thing when they call
[56:58.240 --> 57:00.960]  it's it's the best of the best. Right.
[57:00.960 --> 57:05.440]  I mean, we're talking about Frenchy Canoli and Swami and Nikki and all these people.
[57:05.440 --> 57:08.400]  We were, you know, of course, honored to have them come.
[57:08.800 --> 57:11.760]  They were what we thought was a super ass tight competition.
[57:12.360 --> 57:15.160]  You know, Frenchy was the best.
[57:15.880 --> 57:18.000]  We thought we were bringing in the best to judge.
[57:18.480 --> 57:19.720]  They were. And I think we did.
[57:19.720 --> 57:22.040]  I'm not saying we didn't. I mean.
[57:22.040 --> 57:23.960]  Yeah, I feel you.
[57:23.960 --> 57:27.760]  It's just yeah, it's just kind of, you know, it's, you know.
[57:28.760 --> 57:34.800]  It's a it's a tricky one because it's, you know, like, you know, I go back to them.
[57:34.800 --> 57:38.280]  I spot it quick when I'm just messing up, you know, oh, shit, what's that like?
[57:38.280 --> 57:41.040]  And then taking 14 different samples.
[57:41.440 --> 57:43.360]  Like to me, like that's how you done.
[57:43.720 --> 57:47.280]  That's hundreds of tweezers, you know, like tweezer tweet.
[57:47.280 --> 57:50.920]  You like then somebody might have noticed it earlier is all I'm saying.
[57:50.920 --> 57:55.440]  And then I think one person said, well, when you all did notice it, that you hit the farmers
[57:55.440 --> 58:00.280]  first or the guide, you say, no, we're just going to make this big announcement at the end of it.
[58:00.280 --> 58:02.360]  And through our. No, no, no.
[58:02.360 --> 58:04.760]  And that's something that's that's in my statement, too.
[58:05.160 --> 58:08.000]  We talked about it and I was going to reach out to the farmers again.
[58:08.000 --> 58:14.960]  That's Wednesday prior to my you know, I've got vendor set up day all day Thursday, vendor set up day Friday.
[58:14.960 --> 58:16.480]  And that's that's all on me.
[58:18.520 --> 58:24.240]  I told him I was going to call everybody and let him know I just I ran out of time and and feel horrible for it.
[58:24.880 --> 58:26.960]  So like I said, I've made I've made that apology.
[58:27.880 --> 58:30.000]  Got you. Yeah, that's all good.
[58:30.000 --> 58:33.080]  And I and I am I am you know, I am sorry for it.
[58:33.120 --> 58:34.640]  I mean, that's that's honest to God.
[58:34.640 --> 58:37.920]  Like I said, I I never set out to.
[58:39.000 --> 58:47.240]  Have a company that that that hurt other companies only to uplift other companies, and like I said, if it's not my position to do it, if if, you know.
[58:48.840 --> 58:53.320]  Anyway. Yeah, we got that part, man, we know your intentions are there, bro.
[58:53.320 --> 58:55.800]  We get it. We just want to kind of make things better.
[58:56.200 --> 58:58.800]  Yeah, I can tell you so used to having your shield up.
[58:58.800 --> 59:04.960]  You like every little question you're like, you know, but you know, we really trying to poke you in the eye like that.
[59:04.960 --> 59:13.200]  No more. You know, want to keep get it out there for next year, make that shit even better, because I'd like to come out next year and see what's, you know, what's going on.
[59:13.680 --> 59:18.520]  Yeah, it's that's like your homie who's telling you you have a bad hair day, though.
[59:18.520 --> 59:22.120]  You know, sometimes, you know, it's kind of that tough love.
[59:23.120 --> 59:25.920]  But you ask the tough questions because that's how we grow.
[59:26.000 --> 59:31.040]  And I, you know, don't think you're going to just sit on your laurels after this.
[59:31.600 --> 59:35.680]  One thing that has kind of come up time and time again is is gone.
[59:35.680 --> 59:37.960]  Jay, is there going to be like a continued.
[59:39.800 --> 59:44.960]  Partnership with them, or is it too early to speak in the planning, too early to speak in the planning?
[59:45.720 --> 59:49.120]  I need it. I need a couple of days off before we start making major decisions.
[59:50.120 --> 59:55.440]  Well, what we always say is that I was I was real happy with I was real happy with my partnership with Ghanji.
[59:56.000 --> 01:00:00.520]  Nothing, nothing stuck out to me like there was any kind of ulterior motives.
[01:00:01.480 --> 01:00:03.800]  They've been really remorseful over the whole thing, too.
[01:00:03.800 --> 01:00:06.840]  And so, I mean, I can just speak to my experience with them.
[01:00:08.640 --> 01:00:09.520]  I sure didn't see it.
[01:00:09.720 --> 01:00:12.520]  Well, there ain't no need to pay for something that you can get for free.
[01:00:12.880 --> 01:00:15.080]  You can get man all kinds of people come out.
[01:00:15.080 --> 01:00:17.000]  Well, I didn't I didn't pay Ganja either.
[01:00:17.560 --> 01:00:22.360]  OK, but yeah, so OK, well, that's all they get for free to know.
[01:00:22.360 --> 01:00:24.160]  No, no, no, no.
[01:00:24.160 --> 01:00:24.920]  No, no.
[01:00:24.920 --> 01:00:26.240]  Nope. I am.
[01:00:26.760 --> 01:00:29.840]  One day, matter of fact, all of those students we had were not students.
[01:00:29.840 --> 01:00:31.960]  They were certified ganja that had passed the course.
[01:00:31.960 --> 01:00:35.000]  I'm sorry. Not students came down on their own dime.
[01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:39.160]  I did buy their hotel room and pay for their lodging while they were here for the week.
[01:00:39.920 --> 01:00:44.240]  But the rest of the ganja council paid for their own lodging, Patrick, and all them.
[01:00:44.560 --> 01:00:50.960]  There was no monetary anything other than they would get a booth there and ganja would come down and and do it.
[01:00:51.200 --> 01:00:55.480]  They gave me the they gave me to their tuition to their course.
[01:00:55.480 --> 01:00:59.240]  But there again, I paid for my whole trip to go up there and become certified ganja.
[01:00:59.280 --> 01:01:01.400]  Just wanted to want to get better myself.
[01:01:01.520 --> 01:01:02.680]  OK, so you're locked.
[01:01:02.680 --> 01:01:04.120]  So you're locked in now.
[01:01:04.120 --> 01:01:05.520]  You got the you're in.
[01:01:05.520 --> 01:01:07.840]  You're certified. I am certified.
[01:01:08.080 --> 01:01:09.520]  Well, then that's another deal.
[01:01:09.520 --> 01:01:12.160]  People have said that people, if you just go up there and get it.
[01:01:12.400 --> 01:01:13.920]  Half of my class didn't pass.
[01:01:13.920 --> 01:01:15.000]  They sent a guy back.
[01:01:15.280 --> 01:01:18.000]  That was one point off all the way to eastern Canada.
[01:01:18.280 --> 01:01:22.560]  So that was another something people have said, oh, you just go up there and you give them three thousand dollars and you get it.
[01:01:22.840 --> 01:01:26.200]  There was a lot of really upset people that got sent back home when I was up there.
[01:01:27.080 --> 01:01:28.760]  Was it worth that three G's?
[01:01:29.240 --> 01:01:32.520]  I really enjoyed it, you know, and it's there again.
[01:01:32.520 --> 01:01:35.960]  You know, you pay money to be in groups and brotherhoods and this.
[01:01:35.960 --> 01:01:40.600]  And, you know, I really enjoyed all of the there's a lot of history that's learned there.
[01:01:41.560 --> 01:01:47.320]  You know, you really get to start looking and taking a deeper look into, like I said, try come intactness, try come rightness,
[01:01:48.600 --> 01:01:53.520]  you know, and things like that, try come fullness and really start kind of refining your palate to,
[01:01:54.320 --> 01:01:57.360]  you know, to really start grading competition style cannabis.
[01:01:57.400 --> 01:01:58.520]  I think it was a great course.
[01:02:00.840 --> 01:02:07.880]  Do any of the non-Gange judges get, you know, kind of like an SOP or do they have loops?
[01:02:07.920 --> 01:02:09.800]  What is their job?
[01:02:10.400 --> 01:02:13.240]  Yeah, yeah. So all my all my judges get loops.
[01:02:13.600 --> 01:02:16.360]  We do a training with Swami every year.
[01:02:16.360 --> 01:02:20.400]  You can actually go on YouTube on my channel and watch that Swami training.
[01:02:20.400 --> 01:02:25.080]  It's on my channel. And they just kind of talk about grading cannabis.
[01:02:25.320 --> 01:02:26.640]  They don't go near as deep.
[01:02:26.640 --> 01:02:31.120]  It's not a Gange certification or training by any stretch of the imagination.
[01:02:31.760 --> 01:02:36.840]  He just kind of goes over how how he's graded competition cannabis over the last two decades.
[01:02:37.440 --> 01:02:41.000]  So he's done that two years in a row and that's and I haven't paid Swami either.
[01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:44.200]  He's done that for free to just wanting to kind of spread information.
[01:02:47.800 --> 01:02:58.920]  When you guys decided to work with Gange and promote them this year, were you familiar with the backstory and everything that's coming out with them partnering up with Curalea?
[01:02:59.600 --> 01:03:04.880]  No, I didn't know anything about that until Brandon brought it up the other night on your show, I think.
[01:03:05.480 --> 01:03:13.360]  And do you guys, I guess, from a grassroots, you kind of throw that out there a lot from a grassroots point of view.
[01:03:13.360 --> 01:03:18.760]  Do you guys understand why Brandon and other individuals are upset with that?
[01:03:18.800 --> 01:03:28.440]  It was very tongue in cheek, even just last on Friday about saying, like, you know, we only it's we only sold a couple of seats, I believe, is the verbiage.
[01:03:28.440 --> 01:03:30.280]  And we could even pull that up if you guys like.
[01:03:30.960 --> 01:03:32.440]  But here we are. Here we are.
[01:03:32.600 --> 01:03:37.840]  Homegrown. You know, we do this each and every week on, you know, for free.
[01:03:38.280 --> 01:03:42.600]  And it seems like these individuals are saying one thing and then doing the other.
[01:03:43.840 --> 01:03:52.840]  So I wanted to know your stance on that, because, again, the community is going to be listening, whispering for the rest of this year until the next one.
[01:03:53.640 --> 01:03:57.080]  So, you know, all I know is what matter.
[01:03:57.480 --> 01:04:01.200]  All I know is people use my platform to advertise their business.
[01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.120]  And that's pretty much all the way across the board.
[01:04:05.520 --> 01:04:09.920]  Gungy or Brandon and Gungy were on Adam Dunn.
[01:04:09.920 --> 01:04:13.360]  And so I can't speak for Gungy nor their business decisions.
[01:04:14.560 --> 01:04:17.800]  So I don't know. And nor do I really want to take a stance there again.
[01:04:17.800 --> 01:04:21.440]  I don't want to take stances as far as companies are concerned.
[01:04:21.440 --> 01:04:23.400]  We're throwing a blind competition.
[01:04:23.440 --> 01:04:32.600]  So if I start taking sides one way with you, with them, with, you know, with Brandon, with with anybody, you know, that's that's not our that's not our goal.
[01:04:32.600 --> 01:04:36.680]  So you kind of took their side a little bit by taking that course.
[01:04:36.680 --> 01:04:38.400]  You know, now you're you're already gone.
[01:04:38.400 --> 01:04:44.520]  Yeah. So now you're going to be judged by folks in your club.
[01:04:44.640 --> 01:04:53.320]  Well, I by me going down and getting a certification, I don't think by says that I I don't sit on
[01:04:53.320 --> 01:04:55.320]  their board, I don't make their business decisions.
[01:04:55.320 --> 01:05:00.200]  I just wanted to be a better cannabis grader and throw a better cannabis competition.
[01:05:00.560 --> 01:05:03.040]  Again, you know, there was no ulterior motives.
[01:05:03.040 --> 01:05:05.480]  I'm not that I'm not looking that far forward.
[01:05:05.480 --> 01:05:08.360]  I just wanted to be a good cannabis competition thrower.
[01:05:08.360 --> 01:05:12.960]  So that's the you know, could have done that, could have done, you know, Tricome Institute.
[01:05:12.960 --> 01:05:14.920]  There's a few of them out there. I might still.
[01:05:15.720 --> 01:05:19.000]  But like I said, I you know, I can't speak to their business decisions.
[01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:25.200]  And like I said, there was no ulterior motives as far as I was concerned or I saw whatsoever.
[01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:27.360]  And so, you know, I just don't know.
[01:05:27.680 --> 01:05:33.440]  Yeah. And, you know, again, I kind of said earlier, I break this into kind of three different
[01:05:33.440 --> 01:05:39.200]  categories. And this is a separate category that, yeah, you know, if I were curerly for if I was
[01:05:39.200 --> 01:05:43.640]  going, I wouldn't be sharing my plans with you as a business of what I'm going to do.
[01:05:43.880 --> 01:05:47.480]  But the optics of that situation were fucked up.
[01:05:47.560 --> 01:05:49.440]  I mean, this is how it went in the boardroom.
[01:05:49.520 --> 01:05:52.080]  We're going to go. We're going to judge this competition.
[01:05:52.160 --> 01:05:53.240]  It's going to be wonderful.
[01:05:53.240 --> 01:05:55.160]  We're going to select the best new flowers.
[01:05:55.360 --> 01:05:56.960]  There's going to be tons of great press.
[01:05:57.120 --> 01:06:00.720]  And then we're coming out two days later announcing our partnership with this wonderful thing.
[01:06:01.400 --> 01:06:03.080]  Well, kind of fucking backfired on them.
[01:06:04.320 --> 01:06:07.880]  But yeah, the optics of that weren't good at all.
[01:06:07.880 --> 01:06:10.720]  But that really doesn't have much to do with you.
[01:06:11.680 --> 01:06:18.400]  The ganja and curerly, I I'll stop because I definitely have opinions on that partnership.
[01:06:18.400 --> 01:06:24.560]  But even if you don't have a partnership, you're dealing together, you know, not and I'm not
[01:06:24.560 --> 01:06:27.760]  talking about you guys. I'm just saying ganja and whatever.
[01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:33.720]  Curely, if they're against the grassroots of the small grower, you know, that whole kind of
[01:06:33.720 --> 01:06:39.920]  movement, then I don't want my brand or me personally associated with that, because
[01:06:40.200 --> 01:06:44.560]  without this home grower, you know, we wouldn't have the commercial grower.
[01:06:44.760 --> 01:06:46.320]  You know what I mean? Does that all make sense?
[01:06:46.480 --> 01:06:50.040]  Yeah. And I know Ganja came out and said that they were not against home grows.
[01:06:50.040 --> 01:06:51.880]  All of those guys home grow.
[01:06:51.880 --> 01:06:53.080]  You know, a lot of them do.
[01:06:53.480 --> 01:06:55.720]  And a lot of the guys certified ganja is home grow, too.
[01:06:55.720 --> 01:06:58.000]  So I don't know how to people talk out of the side of their mouth.
[01:06:58.000 --> 01:06:59.000]  I was about to say that.
[01:06:59.600 --> 01:07:03.040]  That is a lot of like, yeah, don't don't say that part, man.
[01:07:03.040 --> 01:07:05.680]  We don't want to the ganja program.
[01:07:06.360 --> 01:07:07.760]  We can talk about this.
[01:07:07.760 --> 01:07:09.680]  We can break it down even on some of that stuff.
[01:07:09.920 --> 01:07:16.360]  Like these guys are saying very tongue in cheek stuff about not not disrespecting home
[01:07:16.360 --> 01:07:18.760]  growers and all of all of the verbiage.
[01:07:18.960 --> 01:07:22.360]  But the reality is, is they're taking those checks and they're willing to take those
[01:07:22.360 --> 01:07:26.600]  checks. And it's starting to seem like other individuals are willing to also take those
[01:07:26.600 --> 01:07:30.400]  checks and the community is calling some of those individuals out.
[01:07:30.760 --> 01:07:34.680]  So if you guys want to rock with the community, I think you should at least educate
[01:07:34.680 --> 01:07:41.960]  yourself more on who Cureleaf is and what a grassroots partnership is, not just selling a
[01:07:41.960 --> 01:07:44.320]  few seats. And he said that verbatim.
[01:07:44.680 --> 01:07:50.320]  And so to to already be deceptive on what's going on and to be deceptive on the way that
[01:07:50.320 --> 01:07:54.840]  he's kind of almost shielding everybody that that works for him so that they can't talk to
[01:07:54.840 --> 01:07:59.080]  us so we can't have a real conversation like I'm having with you right now is also very
[01:07:59.080 --> 01:08:01.600]  eye opening. It's like, why do you have to?
[01:08:02.040 --> 01:08:03.840]  You know, there's always these statements and stuff.
[01:08:03.840 --> 01:08:06.720]  When someone makes a statement to me, that's like, all right, we all need to come
[01:08:06.720 --> 01:08:09.120]  together and we need to hide whatever the fuck's going on.
[01:08:09.400 --> 01:08:14.080]  When you just come on live like this and you have a real discussion that that's what
[01:08:14.080 --> 01:08:15.400]  excited us about this.
[01:08:15.600 --> 01:08:19.440]  But at the same time, I don't think the community, especially some of the older school
[01:08:19.440 --> 01:08:24.400]  individuals, they can recognize when individuals are lying and now they call that cap.
[01:08:24.560 --> 01:08:28.960]  And best believe that when we when that was some of that interview that was being done
[01:08:28.960 --> 01:08:31.720]  with Mr. Gilman, there was a lot of cap going on with that.
[01:08:32.040 --> 01:08:34.120]  And again, we could break that down.
[01:08:34.360 --> 01:08:38.840]  Timestamp. That's that's how I think it affected so many individuals.
[01:08:38.840 --> 01:08:43.000]  It's like, look, you can't say one thing and then and then basically behind the scenes,
[01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.720]  especially doing the press wire and all that stuff.
[01:08:45.720 --> 01:08:49.760]  Man, this isn't just this is a huge company putting together.
[01:08:49.760 --> 01:08:51.200]  Hey, these are things we're going to say.
[01:08:51.200 --> 01:08:53.000]  This is the verbiage that we're going to use.
[01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:54.960]  We're going to use a grassroots partnership.
[01:08:55.280 --> 01:08:57.080]  And for you to say, like, it doesn't matter.
[01:08:57.800 --> 01:09:00.520]  You're not going to be it doesn't matter what other individuals do.
[01:09:00.520 --> 01:09:04.880]  That's kind of the whole point of the hoodies versus the suits is because it should
[01:09:04.880 --> 01:09:07.840]  matter. A lot of people, individuals risk their entire life.
[01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:11.760]  Some people are sitting in prison and jail right now for all this stuff.
[01:09:11.880 --> 01:09:14.440]  And then individuals, I feel like Mr.
[01:09:14.440 --> 01:09:17.240]  Gilman and maybe some other ones have never really taken that risk.
[01:09:17.520 --> 01:09:21.200]  So if you've never taken that risk, you probably sit on the side where, hey, whatever.
[01:09:21.720 --> 01:09:24.640]  It doesn't really matter about the homegrower, the small time individual.
[01:09:24.880 --> 01:09:29.520]  It seems like he's able to to be able to take care of himself and we get into that
[01:09:29.520 --> 01:09:35.120]  even. But the reality is, is that the homegrower is the lifeblood of of the of the
[01:09:35.120 --> 01:09:38.360]  community itself. Nationally, everybody knows that, man.
[01:09:38.560 --> 01:09:40.640]  It's for so many people to take that risk.
[01:09:40.960 --> 01:09:43.080]  So if you're a homegrower, man, then you need to kind of.
[01:09:44.760 --> 01:09:48.800]  I hope in time you answer these questions a little bit differently because that shit
[01:09:48.800 --> 01:09:53.600]  matters to the small time individual, to the small time dude trying to and lady trying
[01:09:53.600 --> 01:09:55.440]  to pay for their families and stuff like that.
[01:09:55.720 --> 01:10:00.680]  Otherwise, you're letting the top again start to take and chip away from people that
[01:10:00.680 --> 01:10:04.480]  have worked hard for a lot of things in the individuals that worked in Oklahoma.
[01:10:05.280 --> 01:10:09.600]  A lot of those people that that were kind of shunned, it seems like they have quite a
[01:10:09.600 --> 01:10:14.480]  skill set and they feel a certain way about just being dismissed as like you guys have
[01:10:14.480 --> 01:10:15.960]  mold, you know, fuck off.
[01:10:15.960 --> 01:10:17.520]  We're going on to the next category.
[01:10:17.680 --> 01:10:22.240]  And I hope today that you guys see that as a grassroots thing from the community.
[01:10:22.400 --> 01:10:23.840]  And I hope that Mr.
[01:10:23.840 --> 01:10:28.720]  Gilman sees that you can't just go up on a on a podcast, especially live with your body
[01:10:28.720 --> 01:10:32.880]  language, the way that you respond, your blink rate, all of the things that give you
[01:10:32.880 --> 01:10:37.160]  away. You can't do that and you're going to get called out for that stuff.
[01:10:37.160 --> 01:10:41.960]  So if you want to continue moving forward and having open discussions, then I think
[01:10:41.960 --> 01:10:43.520]  the dialogue needs to be true.
[01:10:44.080 --> 01:10:47.480]  And you can't just sit there for a few weeks and think about how you're going to answer
[01:10:47.480 --> 01:10:51.440]  things because the community called you out live and I'm calling you out now as well.
[01:10:52.640 --> 01:10:57.400]  Is that gentleman the owner of the is he like the head owner of Ganja?
[01:11:00.080 --> 01:11:06.840]  Like, I don't think he's a head owner, but I did, I you guys should reach out to him
[01:11:06.840 --> 01:11:09.000]  and see if you reach out to him to see if he'd come on.
[01:11:09.400 --> 01:11:10.120]  I'm just curious.
[01:11:10.120 --> 01:11:11.280]  Yeah, man. He's secretly.
[01:11:11.680 --> 01:11:15.120]  Yeah, that's what I'm trying to say to you guys, man, is like, look, there's too many
[01:11:15.120 --> 01:11:19.080]  individuals that will reach out to us and tell us the truth, whether we know it now or
[01:11:19.080 --> 01:11:20.800]  months from now or however it takes.
[01:11:21.080 --> 01:11:25.480]  And so when people try to come on other platforms or their own platforms and make all
[01:11:25.480 --> 01:11:28.800]  these statements and stuff, it's going to get found out, man.
[01:11:28.840 --> 01:11:30.880]  That's just how the community is and it works.
[01:11:30.880 --> 01:11:37.120]  And we we've looked out for each other for a long time and to to even come across as
[01:11:37.120 --> 01:11:41.240]  that you would squish the small time individual, the one that's probably taking risk,
[01:11:41.240 --> 01:11:43.880]  the individuals that have been doing this for a long, long time.
[01:11:45.160 --> 01:11:49.960]  That's the real frustration from also part of the other community is like you guys had
[01:11:49.960 --> 01:11:54.600]  this aspect from your Cowboy Cup and then it shined light on some other bullshit.
[01:11:54.720 --> 01:11:57.960]  And then that brought in a lot of other individuals that probably wouldn't have even
[01:11:57.960 --> 01:12:00.120]  cared about the other stuff, to be honest with you.
[01:12:00.240 --> 01:12:02.440]  Chad even kind of made a good point on that.
[01:12:02.720 --> 01:12:05.800]  So it was almost like two things blew up from that.
[01:12:06.200 --> 01:12:10.920]  And the way it's moving forward, you know, there's a spotlight on that.
[01:12:11.120 --> 01:12:13.800]  And I think it's well-deserved.
[01:12:14.680 --> 01:12:19.600]  You know, you can't be can't be partnering up with the suits and, you know, the chat
[01:12:19.600 --> 01:12:25.160]  says owners, him and Kevin Jottery are the owners.
[01:12:26.160 --> 01:12:27.120]  That's right.
[01:12:27.120 --> 01:12:28.880]  Among come on.
[01:12:29.480 --> 01:12:30.080]  Well, then, Mr.
[01:12:30.080 --> 01:12:32.680]  Gilman probably shouldn't be speaking for Mr.
[01:12:32.680 --> 01:12:35.080]  Jottery because I have the utmost respect.
[01:12:35.480 --> 01:12:36.920]  We've said that time and time again.
[01:12:37.720 --> 01:12:38.840]  And when when Mr.
[01:12:38.840 --> 01:12:40.960]  Jottery speaks, it seems like he is telling the truth.
[01:12:41.640 --> 01:12:42.160]  But Mr.
[01:12:42.160 --> 01:12:43.120]  Gilman was not.
[01:12:43.160 --> 01:12:49.560]  And to play it down as just a couple of seats were sold, when you can easily Google
[01:12:50.120 --> 01:12:56.560]  just a couple of words and find out exactly what went on again is another black eye to
[01:12:56.560 --> 01:12:57.280]  what had happened.
[01:12:57.920 --> 01:13:02.720]  I wonder if it's worse to do that than to just come out and admit it.
[01:13:02.760 --> 01:13:04.360]  Yeah, we needed a bag.
[01:13:04.720 --> 01:13:05.520]  You know what I mean?
[01:13:05.520 --> 01:13:10.160]  Like, I guess the lion's always worse, you know, keeping it 100.
[01:13:11.760 --> 01:13:17.280]  Yeah, I mean, I guess if if a company is using the word partnership and you downplay
[01:13:17.280 --> 01:13:22.600]  that partnership and then another press conference comes out after that, a press wire
[01:13:22.600 --> 01:13:25.560]  comes out after that saying partnership, grassroots partnership.
[01:13:25.600 --> 01:13:28.080]  Again, that's verbiage that is created in the boardroom.
[01:13:28.400 --> 01:13:29.440]  Everybody knows that.
[01:13:30.600 --> 01:13:35.720]  And you can it's all over the Internet, man, where you can kind of see what's going on
[01:13:35.720 --> 01:13:38.960]  with just these big companies like Cureleaf and others.
[01:13:39.200 --> 01:13:41.160]  It's not it's not just this.
[01:13:41.160 --> 01:13:42.960]  It's just the way it was done.
[01:13:42.960 --> 01:13:50.720]  And I think Chad highlighted that eloquently about how it was just a complete it's some
[01:13:50.720 --> 01:13:53.960]  of the timing and all this stuff and it deserves to be highlighted because it seems like
[01:13:53.960 --> 01:13:56.320]  some some fugazi bullshit, man.
[01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.720]  Well, I you know, I think I'm going to leave.
[01:13:59.800 --> 01:14:00.960]  I'm going to leave Greg here.
[01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:04.680]  I've got like I said, when I texted you, I've got a I've got a kiddo that needs a title
[01:14:04.680 --> 01:14:06.720]  to a truck so he can continue to drive it.
[01:14:07.160 --> 01:14:09.120]  I'm more than happy to come back on to.
[01:14:09.120 --> 01:14:11.960]  And like I said, I'll leave Greg and he can answer all the questions, too.
[01:14:11.960 --> 01:14:13.800]  But I have I have to have to go.
[01:14:13.840 --> 01:14:16.280]  I didn't do it for him yesterday and I need to do it today.
[01:14:16.920 --> 01:14:18.720]  Thank you. Appreciate you guys.
[01:14:18.720 --> 01:14:19.760]  The time I really do.
[01:14:19.760 --> 01:14:23.840]  And like I said, I told you before, I'm not I swear I'm not trying to get out anything.
[01:14:24.880 --> 01:14:26.280]  I really appreciate everybody's time.
[01:14:27.280 --> 01:14:28.080]  Greg's here for you.
[01:14:28.320 --> 01:14:34.760]  Appreciate it. And in all fairness, you know, I had reached out last week when this was
[01:14:35.080 --> 01:14:36.520]  all kind of popping off.
[01:14:36.520 --> 01:14:37.680]  I had reached out to Wendy.
[01:14:37.680 --> 01:14:44.000]  I had reached out to Patrick Soil King and said, hey, what's the deal?
[01:14:44.120 --> 01:14:47.640]  And we exchanged a few messages since then.
[01:14:47.640 --> 01:14:53.920]  They've had their opportunities to their own satisfaction to address the questions, whether
[01:14:53.920 --> 01:14:57.960]  it's through Instagram or any other medium.
[01:14:57.960 --> 01:15:00.800]  So they had the opportunity to be here today.
[01:15:00.800 --> 01:15:01.800]  They chose not to.
[01:15:02.800 --> 01:15:04.640]  So we do appreciate you, Greg.
[01:15:05.320 --> 01:15:09.760]  And, you know, Daniel, as well for for hopping out of here and again, you know, it's
[01:15:10.360 --> 01:15:17.360]  those are the other two parts of the three part story that I mentioned, you know, they're
[01:15:17.360 --> 01:15:19.400]  all different things in this currently thing.
[01:15:20.240 --> 01:15:24.480]  Fuck, the optics are bad, but being in as many boardrooms, I know exactly how it would
[01:15:24.480 --> 01:15:27.000]  play it out. And Brian, you nailed it on the head, man.
[01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:31.080]  It's like there's there's scripts, there's pitches that people give out.
[01:15:31.160 --> 01:15:32.760]  You repeat it verbatim enough.
[01:15:32.760 --> 01:15:34.480]  Everybody stays on the same message.
[01:15:34.520 --> 01:15:35.920]  That's the message that's believed.
[01:15:36.240 --> 01:15:43.880]  It was fairly apparent in his retorts to two questions the other week.
[01:15:45.800 --> 01:15:50.640]  Man, that's man, just I know you don't know the answer to this, but it's like what are
[01:15:50.640 --> 01:15:53.960]  the guys a folk like a lot of them are few of them have reached out.
[01:15:53.960 --> 01:15:56.280]  They're not like crazy about they're like torn.
[01:15:56.320 --> 01:16:01.680]  Like, you know, they got into the ganja for a certain reason, which is that grassroots,
[01:16:01.680 --> 01:16:06.560]  which is that homegrown and just to kind of see just exactly what we're talking about.
[01:16:06.560 --> 01:16:10.600]  You know, people are, you know, they're conflicted, you know what I mean?
[01:16:10.600 --> 01:16:14.800]  And I don't blame them. It's kind of speaking out of both sides of your mouth, you
[01:16:14.800 --> 01:16:17.760]  know, but it is what it is.
[01:16:17.760 --> 01:16:21.320]  I was offered to kind of get involved with them some time ago.
[01:16:21.320 --> 01:16:24.480]  But the way I was approached was I didn't like it.
[01:16:24.480 --> 01:16:29.040]  I felt like it was kind of a little bit too like I don't know, it was different.
[01:16:29.040 --> 01:16:30.200]  I didn't get the right vibe.
[01:16:30.200 --> 01:16:37.230]  So that's why I didn't get involved with those folks.
[01:16:37.950 --> 01:16:43.110]  I mean, I guess, you know, everybody's everybody's looking for a way forward on this.
[01:16:44.750 --> 01:16:47.710]  There's been a few things, Brian.
[01:16:48.110 --> 01:16:50.310]  Yeah, I sent you a text in the private chat.
[01:16:51.150 --> 01:16:53.830]  If you want to pull up, I just kind of want to show the audience.
[01:16:54.110 --> 01:16:57.670]  Now you can you can obviously watch things for yourself, but I want to highlight some
[01:16:57.670 --> 01:16:59.230]  things because I know people are busy.
[01:16:59.510 --> 01:17:02.110]  And then if you want to go down the rabbit hole, you can choose to.
[01:17:02.830 --> 01:17:05.190]  But there's something I think the community needs to hear.
[01:17:05.190 --> 01:17:07.150]  And then you guys obviously can read it for yourself.
[01:17:07.830 --> 01:17:14.070]  So if you could pull up the Adam Dunn show, it's our 22 second, around like 11.
[01:17:14.590 --> 01:17:22.950]  Wow. You I just pulled it up and that is the most poignant moment of this, of his
[01:17:22.950 --> 01:17:26.270]  response. That is the response that's going to stick in my head forever.
[01:17:26.270 --> 01:17:27.350]  The oxygen comment.
[01:17:28.110 --> 01:17:32.630]  Well, I think people deserve to hear this because I felt a certain way.
[01:17:32.830 --> 01:17:38.350]  And then hearing the way that the answers were done, the dismissiveness of the body
[01:17:38.350 --> 01:17:44.310]  language. Again, you know, well, maybe maybe we should impress it like that.
[01:17:44.430 --> 01:17:47.910]  You guys listen to this and then you guys, you know, you form your own opinion.
[01:17:48.550 --> 01:17:51.630]  But I think hearing it in live inflicted something.
[01:17:51.910 --> 01:17:53.070]  I don't think I saw this.
[01:17:53.070 --> 01:17:54.950]  And I don't have anything to do with this.
[01:17:55.670 --> 01:18:01.350]  And then, you know, again, in all fairness, this doesn't involve Greg or Daniel.
[01:18:02.470 --> 01:18:06.470]  But also to set this up, Brandon Russ had been on.
[01:18:07.030 --> 01:18:10.350]  Brandon Russ has, you know, said his piece.
[01:18:10.350 --> 01:18:11.950]  He asked some very good questions.
[01:18:12.870 --> 01:18:15.710]  Well, I saw pointed towards Derek and had a few accusations.
[01:18:15.710 --> 01:18:20.590]  So as I play this, he is just hanging up on the line.
[01:18:20.830 --> 01:18:26.550]  So I might have to unplug this so you guys get the audio.
[01:18:26.550 --> 01:18:27.630]  Let's see here.
[01:18:27.870 --> 01:18:28.870]  Now tell me.
[01:18:29.430 --> 01:18:35.750]  Yeah, Brandon's audio final accusation there was leveled at Ghanji and I'd like an
[01:18:35.750 --> 01:18:36.950]  opportunity to address that.
[01:18:36.990 --> 01:18:37.470]  Please.
[01:18:39.990 --> 01:18:42.710]  Thanks. We gave Brandon a lot of oxygen there.
[01:18:43.430 --> 01:18:51.470]  Um, so to be clear, yes, Curaleaf recently announced that they had partnered with
[01:18:51.470 --> 01:18:56.030]  Ghanji. So I'd like to offer a little clarity around what that means.
[01:18:56.510 --> 01:18:58.630]  It means they bought some seats to our program.
[01:18:59.990 --> 01:19:02.390]  That's it. How many seats is this?
[01:19:02.390 --> 01:19:04.550]  A lot of seats. This is a small amount of seats.
[01:19:05.150 --> 01:19:08.590]  Is it like trying to win the Cannabis Cup where you buy 95 percent of the judges
[01:19:08.590 --> 01:19:10.950]  things? No, it's not.
[01:19:11.070 --> 01:19:13.270]  They didn't buy any portion of our company.
[01:19:13.790 --> 01:19:20.550]  They bought a they bought mostly they bought seats to what we call our first step
[01:19:20.550 --> 01:19:26.710]  program, which is just the online portion of our program and doesn't include the live
[01:19:26.710 --> 01:19:28.510]  training and full certification.
[01:19:29.430 --> 01:19:35.430]  They bought a single class, a single class to go through the entire training.
[01:19:36.150 --> 01:19:37.550]  OK, 20 seats.
[01:19:38.230 --> 01:19:40.150]  Not a big deal in the Ghanji world.
[01:19:40.310 --> 01:19:42.630]  All right. We've sold out for our last two years.
[01:19:42.630 --> 01:19:46.070]  We're on track to sell out again this year to individuals.
[01:19:46.910 --> 01:19:48.150]  And so while.
[01:19:50.550 --> 01:19:58.870]  To be clear, you know, our primary purpose is to educate and we don't believe in
[01:19:58.870 --> 01:20:02.310]  discriminating who receives that education.
[01:20:02.630 --> 01:20:10.350]  You know, these people are looking to get educated in order to help others.
[01:20:12.030 --> 01:20:12.950]  That's their goal.
[01:20:12.950 --> 01:20:15.030]  Not about that, but I doubt it.
[01:20:15.950 --> 01:20:22.710]  And to be clear, Ghanji does not support or endorse bans on home grows.
[01:20:24.470 --> 01:20:29.670]  The idea is we're looking to affect change within the cannabis industry.
[01:20:29.910 --> 01:20:35.030]  I mentioned earlier that so much cannabis has been sold based off of THC numbers.
[01:20:35.430 --> 01:20:37.350]  That doesn't help the craft cultivator.
[01:20:37.710 --> 01:20:44.710]  The craft cultivator is producing a product that isn't that isn't strong in high THC
[01:20:44.710 --> 01:20:48.390]  numbers. Typically, it's high in terpene percentages.
[01:20:48.830 --> 01:20:54.150]  OK, the craft cultivator is producing a product whose quality and desirability is
[01:20:54.150 --> 01:20:56.670]  based on how it interacts with the senses.
[01:20:57.470 --> 01:21:01.870]  And so we developed our assessment protocol for specifically that reason, to bring
[01:21:01.870 --> 01:21:07.670]  attention to those qualities that make craft cannabis desirable in an effort to
[01:21:07.670 --> 01:21:09.230]  support the small farmer.
[01:21:09.910 --> 01:21:11.150]  The large MSOs.
[01:21:15.200 --> 01:21:16.400]  They pulled his glasses.
[01:21:17.440 --> 01:21:19.760]  Large MSOs and then you went silent.
[01:21:19.840 --> 01:21:25.200]  Oh, I'm sorry. To the most part, large MSOs tend to produce commercial grade
[01:21:25.200 --> 01:21:29.920]  cannabis. Most commercial grade cannabis isn't produced at that small batch craft
[01:21:29.920 --> 01:21:37.320]  level. So again, you know, we certainly don't endorse bans on home grows and we don't
[01:21:38.760 --> 01:21:44.200]  support being discriminatory in who we offer our education to.
[01:21:44.680 --> 01:21:50.440]  If we begin discriminating who we educate, then what does that list look like?
[01:21:51.600 --> 01:21:54.160]  We say all MSOs, we're not going to educate.
[01:21:54.760 --> 01:21:55.880]  OK, then who else?
[01:21:55.880 --> 01:21:58.080]  What other groups and companies and individuals?
[01:21:58.080 --> 01:21:59.080]  I just wanted to show how.
[01:22:00.920 --> 01:22:02.880]  See how boardroom all this stuff is.
[01:22:03.400 --> 01:22:04.760]  So who is the educated?
[01:22:04.760 --> 01:22:09.600]  And what is it that their employees get to go get a ganja certification?
[01:22:09.600 --> 01:22:11.600]  This is not about no educating.
[01:22:11.600 --> 01:22:13.400]  It's about big ass checks.
[01:22:14.360 --> 01:22:20.400]  Exactly. And so for to say certain things about that again, man, I know, Greg, you're
[01:22:20.400 --> 01:22:25.040]  not really a part of that aspect, but this is highlighting on a whole nother level of
[01:22:25.040 --> 01:22:31.440]  things. And from a grassroots point of view, this needed to be highlighted, man.
[01:22:31.440 --> 01:22:33.640]  I mean, you can't just say one thing and do another.
[01:22:33.840 --> 01:22:39.520]  And I definitely don't think you should be able to just have these kind of like softball
[01:22:39.520 --> 01:22:42.200]  questions and then people run with it.
[01:22:42.200 --> 01:22:46.280]  Like there were other times within that interview where there could have been fantastic
[01:22:46.280 --> 01:22:48.720]  direct questions and that wasn't presented.
[01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:51.720]  And so that's why I wanted to take a moment to highlight.
[01:22:51.920 --> 01:22:56.080]  We can play some other stuff if you'd like or talk on this, because I think moving
[01:22:56.080 --> 01:23:01.480]  forward, the community has to understand who really is with what.
[01:23:01.480 --> 01:23:07.200]  And that's the that's that's the like vileness that a lot of the older individuals
[01:23:07.200 --> 01:23:11.640]  that have done this. That's where that comes from, because it always seems to be this is
[01:23:11.640 --> 01:23:14.040]  how things play out time and time again.
[01:23:14.280 --> 01:23:20.360]  Well, as we both said when Daniel was still in here, you know, we're both home growers.
[01:23:20.360 --> 01:23:25.360]  I mean, the small time growers are you know, it's what we do this for.
[01:23:26.520 --> 01:23:32.400]  The thing one of the things I love about our competition, the fact that it's it's blind.
[01:23:32.400 --> 01:23:34.120]  I mean, anyone can come in.
[01:23:34.320 --> 01:23:35.800]  They can enter the competition.
[01:23:37.160 --> 01:23:43.240]  If they grow good quality medicine or product, then they stand a chance to win.
[01:23:43.240 --> 01:23:48.560]  And it's the small growers up to the big growers, you know, and I love that about our
[01:23:48.560 --> 01:23:54.720]  competition. It really does give an opportunity for someone to showcase their skills no
[01:23:54.720 --> 01:23:56.000]  matter how big they are.
[01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:58.880]  And I mean, there's nothing to replace that.
[01:24:02.010 --> 01:24:05.570]  Damn, I unhighlighted myself and forgot what I was going to say there.
[01:24:06.050 --> 01:24:07.090]  Oh, yes.
[01:24:07.090 --> 01:24:13.890]  Sorry. As far as MSOs versus like small local growers, do you have like a rough
[01:24:13.890 --> 01:24:17.370]  percentage or idea of the entrance?
[01:24:17.370 --> 01:24:22.290]  You know, how many were from MSOs and how many were from, you know, some of these small
[01:24:22.290 --> 01:24:24.210]  craft growers who don't know?
[01:24:25.130 --> 01:24:26.650]  You know, I don't know.
[01:24:26.650 --> 01:24:32.090]  I'm not 100 percent sure of all the companies that entered the competition.
[01:24:32.090 --> 01:24:34.450]  What kind of what kind of company they are?
[01:24:34.450 --> 01:24:37.530]  You know, I mean, they they come in a lot of times.
[01:24:37.530 --> 01:24:40.690]  I mean, we meet those guys the day they do drop off.
[01:24:41.650 --> 01:24:45.770]  They send in a guy with their sample and they enter.
[01:24:45.770 --> 01:24:47.810]  And then the next time we see him is at awards.
[01:24:48.170 --> 01:24:54.410]  So, you know, a lot of these guys that end up winning in our competition don't even have a
[01:24:54.410 --> 01:24:55.610]  booth at our event.
[01:24:56.570 --> 01:25:01.650]  You know, it's it's just guys that are in the industry, in the community here that want to
[01:25:01.650 --> 01:25:02.650]  come out and compete. So.
[01:25:04.890 --> 01:25:09.930]  Cool. And I do think that some individuals in the community, that's why you started to
[01:25:09.930 --> 01:25:14.170]  create this buzz, because people are saying like, hey, I went out there, seemed like it was
[01:25:14.170 --> 01:25:15.970]  JIT, came back out the next year.
[01:25:16.130 --> 01:25:22.290]  And so when when this kind of stuff, from what I also understand, Greg, if you remove
[01:25:22.290 --> 01:25:26.810]  that that judging aspect, a lot of people had a fantastic time with just what you put
[01:25:26.810 --> 01:25:31.330]  together. So I don't want it to be like people went and didn't have a good time because
[01:25:31.330 --> 01:25:35.770]  they have. We mentioned that last week with the High Times Cannabis Cup, when there was
[01:25:35.770 --> 01:25:39.730]  like a monsoon, you can only smoke cannabis on one side, get food on the other.
[01:25:39.930 --> 01:25:41.890]  It was it wasn't organized very well.
[01:25:42.090 --> 01:25:46.650]  So the community understands that little things happen.
[01:25:46.650 --> 01:25:50.370]  And I think as things started to build up, that's why more individuals wanted to be
[01:25:50.370 --> 01:25:55.690]  involved. I think on the your interview with Adam Dunn's crew on Friday, you guys were
[01:25:55.690 --> 01:25:59.010]  saying this this was your most entrance that you guys have had.
[01:26:00.130 --> 01:26:04.450]  So, you know, there's there were a lot of positives, I think, that the community are seeing
[01:26:04.450 --> 01:26:09.770]  moving forward. So that's, again, why I think this this stung for some individuals,
[01:26:09.770 --> 01:26:14.690]  because they wanted to have this be something where they obviously their time and effort
[01:26:14.690 --> 01:26:18.730]  was in there. And to be honest with you, they felt dismissed.
[01:26:19.570 --> 01:26:23.770]  And again, I don't have, you know, it doesn't matter to me, sir.
[01:26:23.930 --> 01:26:29.250]  You know, so when someone feels that way, I think I think you got to kind of I would
[01:26:29.250 --> 01:26:31.570]  almost just reach out maybe again to them.
[01:26:31.690 --> 01:26:36.610]  A five minute conversation even might might go pretty far with what you're trying to do,
[01:26:36.610 --> 01:26:41.810]  because if they're willing to put up the money and the flower again, you know, what's cut
[01:26:41.810 --> 01:26:43.890]  your customer acquisition costs.
[01:26:43.890 --> 01:26:46.890]  Like if you're really thinking business to try to get a lot of growers to put up that
[01:26:46.890 --> 01:26:49.930]  kind of stuff, especially when the first getting into it is probably extremely high.
[01:26:50.090 --> 01:26:54.530]  So if these individuals feel slighted in the in probably the smallest way, they're not
[01:26:54.530 --> 01:26:55.730]  going to come back. And I think.
[01:26:56.090 --> 01:27:01.290]  Absolutely not. You know, I didn't necessarily come from the cannabis.
[01:27:01.690 --> 01:27:06.890]  Industry, right. I mean, I've I've been a part of it for a long time, but, you know, I
[01:27:06.890 --> 01:27:11.970]  got my degree in marketing and management and I've basically just focused on doing
[01:27:11.970 --> 01:27:13.650]  different kinds of aspects of business.
[01:27:13.650 --> 01:27:21.890]  So so, you know, the thing that I noticed with this year, our mistake was the was the
[01:27:21.890 --> 01:27:26.050]  award ceremony. I mean, obviously we can we can go back to how the how the
[01:27:26.050 --> 01:27:29.890]  contaminants were created or things like that and mistakes on timing.
[01:27:29.930 --> 01:27:34.130]  What we truly think is a timing issue, you know, that could easily be corrected with the
[01:27:34.130 --> 01:27:36.650]  time thing. Right. Say easily.
[01:27:36.650 --> 01:27:37.850]  I mean, how the hell do you do it?
[01:27:37.850 --> 01:27:40.930]  We've been beating our head against the wall trying to figure out, you know, what's the
[01:27:40.930 --> 01:27:47.010]  best. Attack to allow these guys enough time to enter a product stable enough to make it
[01:27:47.010 --> 01:27:52.010]  the time that we needed to make and still have an award ceremony and be able to truly
[01:27:52.010 --> 01:27:55.930]  honor the guys who are doing good product, right.
[01:27:56.810 --> 01:27:58.170]  You what do you do?
[01:27:58.170 --> 01:28:02.410]  You throw them throw them a Instagram shout out, man, they've done way more than that.
[01:28:02.410 --> 01:28:04.130]  This thing's worth more than that to them, you know.
[01:28:04.330 --> 01:28:06.850]  And so how do we how do we really address that?
[01:28:06.850 --> 01:28:11.010]  But that's not necessarily the issue that I was speaking on.
[01:28:11.010 --> 01:28:16.130]  I mean, did we necessarily approach the award ceremony the right way?
[01:28:16.290 --> 01:28:19.810]  No, we could definitely handle that a little differently.
[01:28:19.810 --> 01:28:23.650]  You know, for example, 2020 had 100 percent of sun grown flower fail.
[01:28:24.010 --> 01:28:27.530]  Did we get on stage and say 100 percent of sun grown flower failed?
[01:28:27.530 --> 01:28:29.090]  We didn't. We went by it.
[01:28:29.090 --> 01:28:30.170]  We talked about it later.
[01:28:30.170 --> 01:28:35.010]  Right. We explained it to the people before it all came down this year.
[01:28:35.010 --> 01:28:39.010]  Kind of the problem with it was, you know, there were there were guys who didn't have
[01:28:39.010 --> 01:28:42.010]  contaminants. You know, how do we honor those guys?
[01:28:42.730 --> 01:28:44.290]  They they they won.
[01:28:45.010 --> 01:28:45.930]  They won.
[01:28:46.570 --> 01:28:51.130]  Exactly. They they turned in a product that didn't have issues.
[01:28:51.570 --> 01:28:56.090]  And so how do you how do you honor those guys without sliding anyone else?
[01:28:56.330 --> 01:28:57.530]  And had we have.
[01:28:59.490 --> 01:29:03.970]  Not slid some one side, we just slid the other side and vice versa, you know, it
[01:29:03.970 --> 01:29:08.210]  just it's really a kind of a slippery slope, you know, when you don't you don't
[01:29:08.210 --> 01:29:13.170]  lose either way, we definitely wanted to honor the guys that did the product right.
[01:29:13.450 --> 01:29:15.050]  And did it come out correct?
[01:29:15.290 --> 01:29:18.090]  No, it could have been done differently.
[01:29:18.090 --> 01:29:19.650]  And and that's where we're here.
[01:29:19.650 --> 01:29:21.770]  Right. We're trying to learn what's better.
[01:29:21.770 --> 01:29:24.890]  I mean, you're asking me, are we going to contact these guys again?
[01:29:25.130 --> 01:29:26.850]  And it's 100 percent.
[01:29:28.570 --> 01:29:33.010]  One of the things I would like to do, how do I how do I make outdoor better?
[01:29:33.170 --> 01:29:34.450]  Well, who the hell do I talk to?
[01:29:34.490 --> 01:29:35.810]  I talk to the outdoor guys.
[01:29:35.810 --> 01:29:36.890]  I mean, this is our state.
[01:29:36.890 --> 01:29:38.690]  These are the guys that are doing it in the state.
[01:29:39.490 --> 01:29:44.930]  And so how do we allow them a little bit of say in time frame?
[01:29:44.930 --> 01:29:48.970]  Because they're going to know it better than really anyone in the nation because
[01:29:48.970 --> 01:29:50.330]  they're doing it day in and day out.
[01:29:50.730 --> 01:29:53.130]  So, you know, that came out.
[01:29:54.410 --> 01:30:02.210]  It came out to honor the guys who who truly won, you know, with within this
[01:30:02.210 --> 01:30:07.490]  competition. And with that being said, it kind of came out sideways to other people.
[01:30:07.770 --> 01:30:10.810]  So, you know, it's one of those things you can't win, you can't lose, you know,
[01:30:11.170 --> 01:30:12.130]  can't win it away, really.
[01:30:12.170 --> 01:30:20.930]  So I talked to the head grower from one of the companies that won and he said, you
[01:30:20.930 --> 01:30:25.290]  know, the thing is, is we back time this thing from the get go.
[01:30:25.290 --> 01:30:26.730]  I knew when I had to turn in.
[01:30:27.090 --> 01:30:31.970]  So I actually cut my plants down early this year because I needed to make sure to
[01:30:31.970 --> 01:30:35.850]  get a proper 14 day dry and a proper cure.
[01:30:36.010 --> 01:30:42.250]  And so I sat down before I planted my plants or before I made my product cut, I
[01:30:42.250 --> 01:30:46.690]  mean, and backtracked it down from when it was going to get turned in.
[01:30:46.690 --> 01:30:51.050]  And this is when I cut it down and dried it and got it properly dried and cured and
[01:30:51.050 --> 01:30:54.090]  turned it in. And they didn't have anything, you know, forming that.
[01:30:54.090 --> 01:30:55.490]  So that's his words.
[01:30:55.490 --> 01:30:56.490]  That's not me talking.
[01:30:57.130 --> 01:30:58.850]  You know, that's what he said that they did.
[01:30:59.050 --> 01:31:03.490]  And to me, that's a success, you know, formula for success.
[01:31:03.530 --> 01:31:09.450]  So. Because the biggest issue is probably the amount of time, so.
[01:31:09.610 --> 01:31:13.650]  Yeah, for him to think that have that foresight, that's an experienced guy and
[01:31:13.650 --> 01:31:14.250]  that's somebody.
[01:31:15.170 --> 01:31:17.970]  And, you know, that guy is an indoor grower.
[01:31:17.970 --> 01:31:23.170]  He's got a 50 acre facility, one point one acre outdoor facility.
[01:31:24.330 --> 01:31:26.610]  Of his 50 acres, one acre is an outdoor.
[01:31:26.610 --> 01:31:29.490]  It's a it's a legacy patch.
[01:31:29.570 --> 01:31:33.850]  He does it because, you know, his dad was an outdoor grower and he wanted to, you
[01:31:33.850 --> 01:31:35.530]  know, he wanted it's a legacy patch for him.
[01:31:35.530 --> 01:31:38.250]  And so he takes his time with it.
[01:31:38.290 --> 01:31:39.250]  He loves that thing.
[01:31:39.250 --> 01:31:43.850]  And he wants to do good quality outdoor, even though that's not his focus, because
[01:31:43.850 --> 01:31:45.090]  outdoors hard in Oklahoma.
[01:31:46.130 --> 01:31:51.890]  Yeah. And we're east, I think it's already, you know, and and these guys are growing
[01:31:51.890 --> 01:31:54.410]  good flower. No one's saying that it's not good flower.
[01:31:54.410 --> 01:32:00.410]  I think that timing wise, we get we get the timing thing down for the for the outdoor
[01:32:00.410 --> 01:32:04.650]  growers and and we won't have any of those these kind of issues.
[01:32:04.650 --> 01:32:07.210]  You know, they're growing good, good flower here.
[01:32:07.370 --> 01:32:08.730]  And you got to remember.
[01:32:08.770 --> 01:32:13.610]  So, you know, you're talking about a lot of relatively I know not all some of the
[01:32:13.610 --> 01:32:17.730]  folks are probably newer growers, growers with you guys just coming online recently.
[01:32:17.730 --> 01:32:20.090]  I know a lot of experienced folks as well.
[01:32:20.090 --> 01:32:21.890]  So it's a big mix like Jackalope.
[01:32:22.210 --> 01:32:23.290]  She knew her stuff.
[01:32:23.650 --> 01:32:25.130]  She still fell for mold.
[01:32:25.130 --> 01:32:28.130]  She was very surprised not to go back into that.
[01:32:28.130 --> 01:32:31.170]  It's just it's just a little disheartening.
[01:32:31.170 --> 01:32:35.690]  And you know what I would say, man, like just to kind of obviously no one can just, you
[01:32:35.690 --> 01:32:40.130]  know, recoup whatever getting into all that big money kind of stuff.
[01:32:40.130 --> 01:32:45.890]  But at the very minimum, hey, if you guys were in this year and the debacle, her free
[01:32:45.890 --> 01:32:47.610]  entry next year, something like that.
[01:32:47.610 --> 01:32:48.810]  That's just me talking.
[01:32:48.810 --> 01:32:50.170]  I'm spending your money.
[01:32:50.170 --> 01:32:51.250]  You know, I'm just throwing out.
[01:32:51.530 --> 01:32:55.450]  Maybe things like that will be good to kind of keep going in the community.
[01:32:55.450 --> 01:32:56.330]  And we did that.
[01:32:56.570 --> 01:32:58.130]  We did that in twenty twenty.
[01:32:59.050 --> 01:33:03.530]  Whenever one, you know, whenever one failed through the through the testing facility,
[01:33:03.530 --> 01:33:08.410]  the labs, every one of those people got to enter into the competition next year for
[01:33:08.410 --> 01:33:11.890]  free. However many entries they had, they got that many entries.
[01:33:11.890 --> 01:33:15.290]  And if they wanted to come in and do something different, like enter into an edible
[01:33:15.290 --> 01:33:19.210]  category because they process something or the pre-roll category, they could enter in
[01:33:19.210 --> 01:33:20.050]  anything they wanted.
[01:33:20.410 --> 01:33:24.330]  They weren't limited to entering just in that sun grown category.
[01:33:24.330 --> 01:33:26.810]  So we try to be as fair as we can.
[01:33:26.810 --> 01:33:29.050]  I mean, like I said, we're both from Oklahoma.
[01:33:29.050 --> 01:33:30.890]  I was born here. I'm forty four years old.
[01:33:30.890 --> 01:33:34.010]  I was born in nineteen seventy eight Oklahoma City Memorial Hospital.
[01:33:34.770 --> 01:33:39.730]  I've lived outside of Oklahoma for five months of my life when I was 15 years old.
[01:33:39.730 --> 01:33:42.610]  And my dad said, hell no, we're going back home.
[01:33:42.890 --> 01:33:44.810]  And this is what I've done since, man.
[01:33:45.050 --> 01:33:51.370]  The last thing I ever want to do is damage anything that has to do with the state,
[01:33:51.370 --> 01:33:54.530]  especially in an industry that I'm in and an industry that I love.
[01:33:55.250 --> 01:33:58.130]  You know, I'm I'm the event coordinator.
[01:33:58.130 --> 01:34:02.850]  I deal with all these vendors and and I put the event on and.
[01:34:04.010 --> 01:34:07.490]  It's the best industry I've ever been in, I've done a lot of shows in other industries
[01:34:07.490 --> 01:34:11.730]  and things, you know, being a part of trade shows and stuff like that, and this is the
[01:34:11.730 --> 01:34:12.850]  best industry I've ever been in.
[01:34:13.210 --> 01:34:14.610]  I love the community.
[01:34:14.610 --> 01:34:17.890]  I love the people. I love what the state's doing.
[01:34:20.370 --> 01:34:24.530]  Last thing we ever want to do is hurt anything in the state by any means.
[01:34:24.530 --> 01:34:31.370]  So well, I'm glad, too, that you offered the the growers that failed this year another
[01:34:31.370 --> 01:34:36.250]  option, which was a refund, because I you know, some people might not necessarily be
[01:34:36.250 --> 01:34:38.010]  hot on wanting to come back next year.
[01:34:38.250 --> 01:34:39.570]  And that's their prerogative.
[01:34:39.690 --> 01:34:45.850]  And that's, you know, the refund, because there is there's a lot of time, energy and
[01:34:45.850 --> 01:34:49.450]  emotion that go into these things that, you know, can never be recouped.
[01:34:50.330 --> 01:34:54.210]  This this was this was your big dance and you showed up to the wrong address.
[01:34:54.210 --> 01:35:00.410]  So at the end of the day, you know, we really just hope that that we can we can be
[01:35:00.410 --> 01:35:01.570]  trusted by those guys.
[01:35:02.010 --> 01:35:09.730]  You know, I mean, yes, you know, there were there were hiccups in the competition.
[01:35:11.090 --> 01:35:14.930]  I say competition in the way that it was addressed at the end of it and everything.
[01:35:16.210 --> 01:35:20.210]  But can we gain their trust to trust that, hey, our SOPs are solid?
[01:35:21.010 --> 01:35:23.730]  You know, there will I'm I'm going to have them on paper next year.
[01:35:23.730 --> 01:35:28.410]  Everyone's going to sign something saying that they've read my SOPs, that they
[01:35:28.410 --> 01:35:30.890]  understand this is exactly how we're going to handle the product.
[01:35:31.570 --> 01:35:33.530]  This is exactly how it's going to be dealt with.
[01:35:33.530 --> 01:35:38.690]  And and not because I want to be able to go, look, you signed it.
[01:35:38.690 --> 01:35:41.410]  It's because I want them to understand this is what you're entering.
[01:35:42.050 --> 01:35:44.930]  We are 100 percent transparent.
[01:35:45.330 --> 01:35:48.290]  You want to know exactly where you stand in the competition.
[01:35:48.290 --> 01:35:51.730]  You can call Daniel and if you took one hundred and ten, he'll tell you you took one
[01:35:51.730 --> 01:35:55.050]  hundred and ten and he'll read you why what the judges said.
[01:35:55.050 --> 01:35:59.530]  I mean, there's no nothing, nothing to be hidden.
[01:35:59.970 --> 01:36:04.930]  So and yeah, and you already mentioned to, you know, for the outdoor growers, maybe
[01:36:04.930 --> 01:36:08.290]  make an adjustment and again, notifying people of the sample size, what's
[01:36:08.290 --> 01:36:12.610]  appropriate, I think what also might be good is like I mentioned before, all of
[01:36:12.610 --> 01:36:16.690]  these tests are going to have a moisture content, have that grower initial next to
[01:36:16.690 --> 01:36:22.210]  that moisture content, just so they know, because again, you jar some of that stuff
[01:36:22.210 --> 01:36:24.410]  up and I wouldn't do it myself.
[01:36:24.770 --> 01:36:32.130]  You know, and I'm sorry, one question quick, though, that would come in here because
[01:36:32.130 --> 01:36:35.890]  everything was done in the same facility, different time frame, so different days.
[01:36:35.890 --> 01:36:40.050]  So, you know, if you want to say there was an alien with mold spores releasing them.
[01:36:40.570 --> 01:36:45.250]  Sorry, I'm not trying to belittle anybody here or anything, but same facility, same
[01:36:45.250 --> 01:36:48.770]  procedures. How many of the indoor failed?
[01:36:49.050 --> 01:36:50.210]  What was the percentage?
[01:36:50.210 --> 01:36:53.010]  Do you know that? Because there was a lot there was a higher number of entries.
[01:36:53.290 --> 01:36:57.850]  Correct. There were there were 126 indoor entries.
[01:36:57.850 --> 01:37:02.610]  Gondia actually only assessed 20.
[01:37:03.370 --> 01:37:04.730]  They assessed the top 20.
[01:37:04.930 --> 01:37:09.450]  And of those top 20, I believe it was one that they had failed for contaminants.
[01:37:09.450 --> 01:37:16.930]  I'm not sure what those contaminants were, but there were there were one or two that
[01:37:16.930 --> 01:37:17.970]  had contaminants in it.
[01:37:18.330 --> 01:37:19.290]  Not 100 percent sure.
[01:37:19.650 --> 01:37:20.370]  OK, thanks.
[01:37:20.370 --> 01:37:22.530]  Thanks for answering that, though, because.
[01:37:22.610 --> 01:37:23.690]  That's 20. So.
[01:37:24.570 --> 01:37:26.010]  OK, one out of 20.
[01:37:27.450 --> 01:37:32.450]  All right. I think one thing is the overwhelming thing is, well, somebody in the
[01:37:32.450 --> 01:37:35.450]  chat, do you think Wendy volunteered to go on stage?
[01:37:36.250 --> 01:37:40.450]  Was she asked to go on like, hey, guys, when do you go up or.
[01:37:41.090 --> 01:37:43.570]  I'm not 100 percent sure how that went down.
[01:37:44.050 --> 01:37:48.530]  I was kind of in the background organizing trophies and things and trying to just make
[01:37:48.530 --> 01:37:53.930]  sure that, you know, I mean, you've got 100 and something trophies in the back on a
[01:37:53.930 --> 01:37:59.090]  table. You're trying to make sure that first place gets first place in this particular
[01:37:59.090 --> 01:38:03.690]  category. And so, you know, I wasn't real privy to all that conversation.
[01:38:04.450 --> 01:38:07.010]  I just I know that she went up.
[01:38:07.050 --> 01:38:09.010]  So, yeah, I got you.
[01:38:09.810 --> 01:38:12.170]  Yeah, I got that timestamp.
[01:38:12.250 --> 01:38:13.330]  You guys want to check that out.
[01:38:13.690 --> 01:38:19.450]  Derek was talking about it at one hour and 16 minutes so that you guys can hear from
[01:38:19.450 --> 01:38:21.130]  his his voice.
[01:38:21.450 --> 01:38:23.250]  You know what?
[01:38:23.250 --> 01:38:29.570]  A lot of people had the feeling this was kind of like a fixed job, like, oh, see, now
[01:38:29.570 --> 01:38:30.730]  you need God. Yeah.
[01:38:30.770 --> 01:38:32.730]  You know, that's how that's how it keeps coming.
[01:38:32.890 --> 01:38:36.610]  Well, in fairness, anytime something pops off, it seems like people go crazy for a
[01:38:36.610 --> 01:38:40.530]  variety of, you know, and again, that's why we want to have these kind of things.
[01:38:40.530 --> 01:38:45.250]  And hopefully this is a spot where we can all have open and honest dialogue and
[01:38:45.250 --> 01:38:49.170]  sometimes call out individuals that are trying to deceive.
[01:38:49.650 --> 01:38:53.530]  All right. One hour and 16.
[01:38:53.530 --> 01:38:56.810]  Let's give this a a monetary solution.
[01:38:57.250 --> 01:38:58.930]  I just not entirely accurate.
[01:38:58.930 --> 01:39:02.170]  Dave, that's an inaccurate representation.
[01:39:02.450 --> 01:39:04.650]  What? What? OK, I'll get it.
[01:39:04.650 --> 01:39:05.330]  I wasn't there.
[01:39:05.810 --> 01:39:07.770]  Mindy wasn't out on the stage.
[01:39:08.890 --> 01:39:15.570]  She identified her level of experience in trying to show that she's a cultivator
[01:39:15.570 --> 01:39:20.730]  herself. She got on stage and mentioned on how she had to throw out a significant
[01:39:20.730 --> 01:39:26.770]  portion of her own crop from this year because it got contaminated with mold.
[01:39:27.610 --> 01:39:31.490]  But what I guess what I'm trying to say is maybe we don't even know that a monetary
[01:39:31.490 --> 01:39:34.050]  solution. She didn't offer a monetary solution.
[01:39:34.370 --> 01:39:37.490]  She offered guidance and advice to anybody who was looking for it.
[01:39:37.610 --> 01:39:40.690]  And she didn't and she didn't say that we were charging for that or that she was
[01:39:40.690 --> 01:39:43.770]  charging for that. Well, again, I'm trying to be neutral here.
[01:39:43.770 --> 01:39:48.450]  But does the gun year program charge for education training in that subject?
[01:39:48.450 --> 01:39:53.610]  Because I was what I'm trying to say is it probably would have gone over great if
[01:39:53.970 --> 01:39:59.370]  five seconds before anyone took the stage to discuss the outdoor category where
[01:39:59.370 --> 01:40:06.210]  everyone failed, everyone powwowed off camera and said, guys, we had a problem.
[01:40:06.930 --> 01:40:11.090]  Testing failed. We should probably not judge this category right now.
[01:40:11.330 --> 01:40:13.570]  We should offer resubmissions.
[01:40:14.250 --> 01:40:17.930]  Let everyone send in another sample, because you know what?
[01:40:18.170 --> 01:40:20.050]  You can drop the high and the low.
[01:40:20.250 --> 01:40:25.570]  But when you're literally failing, 95 percent of the entries, you probably just
[01:40:25.570 --> 01:40:26.650]  have to go. You know what?
[01:40:26.930 --> 01:40:28.090]  We're going to pass over this.
[01:40:28.090 --> 01:40:33.890]  We have so many other amazing categories and let's allow them to resubmit without
[01:40:33.890 --> 01:40:37.170]  saying a word on stage.
[01:40:37.930 --> 01:40:40.770]  You know, and we've been that that's a thought.
[01:40:40.810 --> 01:40:45.650]  And I don't I agree that, you know, one of the scenarios we thought, you know, how
[01:40:45.650 --> 01:40:46.890]  could we how could we do it better?
[01:40:46.890 --> 01:40:48.970]  Well, could I have just postponed the.
[01:40:48.970 --> 01:40:49.610]  All right. We can.
[01:40:49.970 --> 01:40:51.850]  And we all powwow later and.
[01:40:52.610 --> 01:40:59.050]  We can jump to one twenty three forty seven, because he said that, you know, basically
[01:40:59.050 --> 01:41:04.850]  he's saying when he was open and honest and doing these things and then Brandon felt a
[01:41:04.850 --> 01:41:07.770]  different way. Jack felt a different way.
[01:41:07.770 --> 01:41:10.810]  A few other people felt a different way that I'm not going to name because they don't
[01:41:10.810 --> 01:41:15.850]  want to be named. But in real time, like how Adam, you know, sometimes we just can't
[01:41:15.850 --> 01:41:19.170]  help ourselves when we hear bullshit from like if you're a cannabis person.
[01:41:19.170 --> 01:41:21.090]  So when he called out, I don't believe that.
[01:41:21.650 --> 01:41:23.690]  That's a genuine reaction.
[01:41:24.010 --> 01:41:28.810]  And so I feel like he has another genuine reaction at one twenty three forty seven.
[01:41:30.850 --> 01:41:33.130]  He did in order to get more.
[01:41:34.810 --> 01:41:37.770]  That's their goal about that, but I doubt it.
[01:41:38.730 --> 01:41:45.530]  And to be clear, Gandhi does not support or endorse bans on home grows.
[01:41:45.890 --> 01:41:52.410]  The idea is we're looking to affect change within the cannabis industry.
[01:41:52.610 --> 01:41:57.730]  I mentioned earlier that so much cannabis has been sold based off of THC numbers.
[01:41:58.170 --> 01:42:00.090]  That doesn't help the craft cultivator.
[01:42:00.450 --> 01:42:04.170]  The craft cultivator is producing a product that isn't.
[01:42:05.210 --> 01:42:11.090]  That isn't strong in high THC numbers, typically it's high in terpene percentages.
[01:42:11.570 --> 01:42:14.290]  OK, the craft cultivator is producing a product.
[01:42:14.290 --> 01:42:18.090]  Now, that's not reality and desirability is based on how it is.
[01:42:18.090 --> 01:42:18.610]  Hold on a second.
[01:42:18.610 --> 01:42:20.250]  His senses. We thought.
[01:42:20.890 --> 01:42:21.890]  Yeah, I think I'm sorry.
[01:42:21.890 --> 01:42:24.810]  I think I mislabeled that it was one oh four forty.
[01:42:25.370 --> 01:42:30.250]  I think is the one where his general reaction to what Wendy said on stage.
[01:42:30.450 --> 01:42:31.170]  Apologize.
[01:42:34.200 --> 01:42:37.720]  Everything that was mentioned is kind of like a business standpoint of some
[01:42:37.720 --> 01:42:41.800]  obstacles where you're trying to protect yourself as well.
[01:42:42.080 --> 01:42:48.040]  And I can't you can't go on stage and publicly slander people like and, you know,
[01:42:48.360 --> 01:42:50.680]  and say things that are going to hurt their businesses.
[01:42:50.880 --> 01:42:52.640]  That's not right. It's unprofessional.
[01:42:52.960 --> 01:42:55.320]  And again, it's like it was promising.
[01:42:55.320 --> 01:42:59.240]  And how much credibility strokes to it was like it made everybody sort of.
[01:42:59.320 --> 01:43:00.840]  I mean, I heard it live to myself.
[01:43:00.840 --> 01:43:05.720]  And I was like, oh, like she had Rosenthal to everybody, bro.
[01:43:05.720 --> 01:43:09.200]  Just like I thought it fucking last year when he fucking went up
[01:43:09.200 --> 01:43:12.720]  and pulled everybody that they didn't know how to grow and they were doing it wrong.
[01:43:12.720 --> 01:43:13.960]  She did the same fucking thing.
[01:43:14.400 --> 01:43:15.560]  Honestly, I don't know.
[01:43:15.560 --> 01:43:16.200]  Is Wendy's.
[01:43:16.200 --> 01:43:18.080]  I was Wendy conversation.
[01:43:19.200 --> 01:43:21.560]  I started this conversation with an apology.
[01:43:23.040 --> 01:43:26.280]  I'm sorry, but that Ed Rosenthal line is fucking golden.
[01:43:26.520 --> 01:43:28.440]  Where's where's my where's my bars?
[01:43:29.280 --> 01:43:30.960]  Oh, no. Oh, no.
[01:43:33.120 --> 01:43:38.080]  I think people are at least can see from from from other people's point of view.
[01:43:38.080 --> 01:43:40.040]  However, certain things came off.
[01:43:40.040 --> 01:43:42.040]  This is how other people felt about it.
[01:43:42.600 --> 01:43:46.160]  It wasn't he. Adam wasn't the only person that used the word cringe.
[01:43:46.400 --> 01:43:47.240]  You know, so.
[01:43:48.600 --> 01:43:53.080]  I think to say that you were just miss miss miss interpreted or something.
[01:43:53.640 --> 01:43:56.400]  I don't I don't think people feel that way.
[01:43:58.360 --> 01:44:04.040]  So so that's the that's kind of the brass tacks of that aspects of it is,
[01:44:04.480 --> 01:44:06.840]  you know, people felt a certain way they they got there.
[01:44:07.840 --> 01:44:11.000]  I mean, it's time and effort was dismissed, in their opinion.
[01:44:11.600 --> 01:44:14.680]  And, you know, now they reached out to us.
[01:44:14.680 --> 01:44:18.920]  And I think especially after now and, you know, probably other dialogue,
[01:44:19.200 --> 01:44:23.520]  people will start to see that, you know, you guys are at least willing to come down
[01:44:23.520 --> 01:44:25.560]  and be interviewed.
[01:44:25.560 --> 01:44:28.440]  And again, that goes a long way just from the community itself,
[01:44:28.440 --> 01:44:33.680]  because so many people will say a lot of stuff on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter.
[01:44:34.280 --> 01:44:38.240]  But if you behind the scenes, DM them, hey, platforms, yours,
[01:44:38.320 --> 01:44:40.440]  all of a sudden they don't want to come on.
[01:44:40.440 --> 01:44:42.120]  And that's telling as well.
[01:44:42.120 --> 01:44:45.240]  So I think that there's a lot to learn from the community.
[01:44:45.240 --> 01:44:49.320]  And again, if we're just the town squire, everybody should be able to have,
[01:44:50.120 --> 01:44:53.280]  you know, voice their opinion again, as long as it's respectful.
[01:44:53.280 --> 01:44:56.960]  And I think that's hopefully what we're showing today is, you know,
[01:44:56.960 --> 01:45:00.240]  you can have sometimes some candid conversations
[01:45:00.880 --> 01:45:03.440]  that could be potentially people feel a certain way about them.
[01:45:04.080 --> 01:45:06.440]  And as long as we just talk it through.
[01:45:07.040 --> 01:45:10.560]  I feel like I've learned a lot just from you, Greg and Daniel,
[01:45:10.560 --> 01:45:14.320]  saying that all the other, you know, ten out of ten sungrown
[01:45:15.080 --> 01:45:17.160]  had failed the year previous.
[01:45:17.960 --> 01:45:19.480]  Nobody was talking about that.
[01:45:19.480 --> 01:45:20.880]  Nobody had said that to me.
[01:45:20.880 --> 01:45:23.840]  So that's why I'm saying we have to we have to truly understand something
[01:45:23.840 --> 01:45:26.360]  from everybody's perspective to try to understand
[01:45:27.480 --> 01:45:30.760]  as best we can what happened so that we can relay to you
[01:45:30.840 --> 01:45:34.200]  so that there's the weird stuff that seems to come out
[01:45:34.200 --> 01:45:36.000]  with some of the drama from cannabis.
[01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:38.320]  We could squash it right away.
[01:45:38.320 --> 01:45:40.240]  And obviously we're doing that.
[01:45:40.800 --> 01:45:42.440]  Or hopefully we're doing that.
[01:45:42.440 --> 01:45:43.360]  Yeah, for sure.
[01:45:43.360 --> 01:45:47.640]  Like I said, when we first got on, you know, you guys,
[01:45:47.640 --> 01:45:50.480]  you guys run a good show.
[01:45:50.480 --> 01:45:52.560]  What I've seen, I've really enjoyed watching.
[01:45:52.560 --> 01:45:53.920]  You guys are open.
[01:45:53.920 --> 01:45:58.120]  You want to hear everything, you know, and willing to give everyone
[01:45:58.120 --> 01:46:00.840]  an opportunity to speak if they're willing to come on here and speak.
[01:46:00.840 --> 01:46:05.160]  So I just want to really appreciate you guys and what you guys are doing. So.
[01:46:06.680 --> 01:46:09.400]  We need this, you know, we need we need community
[01:46:09.720 --> 01:46:13.440]  and the community needs to be able to hear from everyone in any aspect.
[01:46:13.440 --> 01:46:17.320]  I mean, and we need a platform like this that allows us to talk
[01:46:17.320 --> 01:46:19.320]  when we need to talk. So appreciate you guys.
[01:46:19.680 --> 01:46:20.600]  Shout out.
[01:46:21.400 --> 01:46:22.720]  And it needs to be live.
[01:46:22.720 --> 01:46:25.960]  I think that's the main thing that's something that Marco, myself,
[01:46:26.080 --> 01:46:30.000]  Chad, Leighton, everybody that's involved, Peter, with the show is that,
[01:46:30.160 --> 01:46:34.160]  you know, having a three hour conversation, you know, a lot of a lot of things come out.
[01:46:34.160 --> 01:46:38.720]  And so it's nice to see when we can get to the bottom of something
[01:46:39.480 --> 01:46:40.800]  and continue to move forward.
[01:46:40.800 --> 01:46:44.280]  And it sounds like you guys are really open to just kind of hopefully learning
[01:46:44.280 --> 01:46:48.080]  more from the community itself, reaching out to those individuals and being like,
[01:46:48.080 --> 01:46:51.360]  look, you know, how do we make this better for you guys so that
[01:46:51.920 --> 01:46:53.400]  you guys want to be involved?
[01:46:53.400 --> 01:46:57.520]  I saw in hindsight, man, you know, there's a lot of expos that were around.
[01:46:58.600 --> 01:47:01.840]  This was before covid and stuff, but a lot of people were trying to pop off
[01:47:01.840 --> 01:47:03.240]  with these huge expos.
[01:47:03.240 --> 01:47:06.360]  And the one thing I noticed is the people that actually paid attention
[01:47:06.360 --> 01:47:09.480]  to the community, the guys that were throwing these large events,
[01:47:10.360 --> 01:47:13.000]  they would make sure that they had the hottest seeds there
[01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:16.400]  and they would make sure that they were or they try their best to make sure
[01:47:16.400 --> 01:47:20.720]  that their venue would would allow those big name individuals
[01:47:20.720 --> 01:47:22.440]  to be able to sell their seeds.
[01:47:22.440 --> 01:47:25.560]  And then what that would do would create such a buzz because now
[01:47:25.560 --> 01:47:27.880]  the community wants to come and see their favorite grower.
[01:47:28.160 --> 01:47:30.520]  Granted, that nostalgia is kind of dipped over the years,
[01:47:30.720 --> 01:47:33.400]  but especially back then, man, it was like to see, you know, you're
[01:47:33.800 --> 01:47:36.520]  somebody you've looked up to or, you know, you grow their gear
[01:47:36.520 --> 01:47:39.160]  and it's paying for your
[01:47:39.160 --> 01:47:40.880]  your livelihood and that kind of stuff.
[01:47:40.880 --> 01:47:42.280]  People were all about that.
[01:47:42.280 --> 01:47:44.480]  And all of that has gone to the wayside now.
[01:47:44.480 --> 01:47:48.600]  So, you know, just saying to you, Greg, you guys could potentially have that
[01:47:48.840 --> 01:47:51.280]  have that where people want to fly into your event.
[01:47:51.520 --> 01:47:54.760]  And if you have that, where people want to wear your hats, fly into your event,
[01:47:55.240 --> 01:47:56.440]  you have the community.
[01:47:56.440 --> 01:47:58.320]  And once you have the community's ear
[01:47:58.320 --> 01:48:01.120]  and you have the bigger name individuals that want to come and be represented,
[01:48:01.800 --> 01:48:04.480]  that shit grows like wildfire, at least it used to.
[01:48:04.720 --> 01:48:08.480]  And I think hopefully in newer states that it would be that that buzz
[01:48:08.480 --> 01:48:13.600]  and that that, you know, nostalgia hasn't hasn't gone away too much in Oklahoma.
[01:48:14.320 --> 01:48:17.920]  Well, as a homegrower myself, let's be real.
[01:48:17.920 --> 01:48:19.680]  I've gone through some genetics that.
[01:48:20.840 --> 01:48:22.960]  Lacked a little luster, and I've had some good ones.
[01:48:23.160 --> 01:48:25.840]  Hey, let's we all know what how important good genetics are.
[01:48:25.840 --> 01:48:31.280]  So to be able to offer that even to the public to come in or or commercial growers,
[01:48:32.040 --> 01:48:36.040]  small growers, you know, to be able to get the right genetics is important.
[01:48:36.040 --> 01:48:38.560]  So what do you think, Brian?
[01:48:38.560 --> 01:48:43.320]  Like because you you've been, you know, like, in other words,
[01:48:43.320 --> 01:48:47.280]  a fan of the game, meaning cannabis, you're you're a historian in the game.
[01:48:47.280 --> 01:48:51.040]  You you know who did what and when and that kind of thing.
[01:48:51.720 --> 01:48:56.360]  Do you think it's the the cups have gone to be more like consumer driven
[01:48:56.360 --> 01:49:00.440]  instead of focusing more on that guy and the homegrower himself?
[01:49:00.440 --> 01:49:03.280]  Are they more interested in just bringing the crowds in
[01:49:03.760 --> 01:49:06.360]  no matter how much they know about cannabis or what?
[01:49:07.400 --> 01:49:09.080]  What do you think is the issue?
[01:49:09.080 --> 01:49:13.480]  I think most individuals that put time and effort like growing craft cannabis.
[01:49:13.480 --> 01:49:17.480]  So you're talking, you know, spending the time to build a loyal
[01:49:17.480 --> 01:49:19.840]  a living soil system, all of that stuff.
[01:49:19.840 --> 01:49:22.800]  The contest matters to to that individual
[01:49:22.800 --> 01:49:25.360]  because they're taking the time to be able to do that.
[01:49:25.360 --> 01:49:29.440]  So around the country, people I've seen it firsthand, even with you, buddy.
[01:49:29.480 --> 01:49:33.680]  You put so much time and effort into it when you when you finally are getting judged
[01:49:33.680 --> 01:49:37.560]  or when they're up there doing the awards ceremony, not saying anything with cowboy
[01:49:37.560 --> 01:49:40.280]  cut because there's nothing to do with that other events.
[01:49:40.720 --> 01:49:44.680]  When you when most of those are up there, that's when the community is sitting there
[01:49:44.680 --> 01:49:47.960]  as a whole, looking at each other and nine out of 10 times
[01:49:48.640 --> 01:49:52.200]  the audience feels cheated, like the masses feel cheated
[01:49:52.200 --> 01:49:54.800]  because it's like, wait a minute, you know, they know.
[01:49:54.800 --> 01:49:56.680]  And it's in each state that way.
[01:49:56.680 --> 01:50:01.160]  So that's why so many people have gravitated towards more of like the homegrower
[01:50:01.160 --> 01:50:04.520]  or a peer related thing, or maybe it's an invitation only thing
[01:50:04.520 --> 01:50:07.360]  or something where there's a little more credibility to it
[01:50:07.360 --> 01:50:11.160]  so that it means something, because for the most part now,
[01:50:11.360 --> 01:50:15.920]  the major awards don't mean shit to the people that are the hot,
[01:50:16.160 --> 01:50:21.120]  you know, the hot growers, the hot individuals with solventless tech and stuff.
[01:50:21.120 --> 01:50:24.280]  But they're more concerned with just kind of like, you know,
[01:50:24.920 --> 01:50:26.000]  building their brand.
[01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:28.600]  And I would imagine like, what is their peer group thing?
[01:50:28.840 --> 01:50:31.560]  You know, because because the awards don't mean anything anymore
[01:50:32.120 --> 01:50:34.840]  to most of the especially the old school individuals.
[01:50:35.200 --> 01:50:37.920]  So it's that young cat that needs to cut his teeth.
[01:50:37.920 --> 01:50:39.040]  And he I need that.
[01:50:39.040 --> 01:50:42.720]  I need to win this because once I win this cup, then now my genetics
[01:50:42.720 --> 01:50:46.360]  will pump and now my name will push and it's kind of a needed.
[01:50:46.400 --> 01:50:48.520]  Yeah. So it's got to be a reputable thing.
[01:50:48.520 --> 01:50:49.240]  It's got to be.
[01:50:50.320 --> 01:50:55.440]  And again, I want to highlight Marco's stuff, so we I fly out for
[01:50:56.200 --> 01:51:00.760]  whatever, whatever they call it, the National National Cannabis Competition.
[01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:03.760]  Right. And so it's a big, big hyped event.
[01:51:03.760 --> 01:51:06.080]  You know, Marco's shit's all over the flyer.
[01:51:06.080 --> 01:51:08.360]  So it's like, hell yeah, man, I'll fly out there for you.
[01:51:08.720 --> 01:51:12.560]  So we go through the whole rigmarole, you know, hanging out, trying to find people.
[01:51:12.560 --> 01:51:13.800]  It's pretty cool event.
[01:51:13.800 --> 01:51:15.720]  You can still see a lot of people are newer to it.
[01:51:15.960 --> 01:51:18.240]  Then we get to the the award ceremony.
[01:51:18.720 --> 01:51:22.120]  Marco's not even mentioned, you know, and it's heartbreaking
[01:51:22.120 --> 01:51:25.280]  because you can see that they had obviously already set this stuff up again.
[01:51:25.280 --> 01:51:26.280]  That's one event.
[01:51:26.280 --> 01:51:29.480]  But but that's how the community feels time and time again.
[01:51:29.720 --> 01:51:32.800]  It's like, all right, we all put our hopes and dreams into this brand
[01:51:32.800 --> 01:51:36.280]  or this new event coordinator, whatever that title is,
[01:51:36.680 --> 01:51:38.280]  sometimes under the same umbrella.
[01:51:38.280 --> 01:51:41.200]  And then when it comes out as the same kind of thing or you find out like,
[01:51:41.200 --> 01:51:44.440]  oh, this person was hanging out with the other person the night before.
[01:51:45.360 --> 01:51:48.160]  You know, it's just, again, the transparency aspect of it.
[01:51:48.880 --> 01:51:52.640]  If I was competing in anything, I would want transparency on the
[01:51:52.640 --> 01:51:54.040]  how the judging works.
[01:51:54.040 --> 01:51:59.040]  And time and time again, that's the biggest glaring thing that that it seems like most
[01:51:59.880 --> 01:52:02.880]  most cannabis like organizers,
[01:52:03.880 --> 01:52:07.280]  they don't pay enough attention to or it seems like they almost kind of like
[01:52:07.680 --> 01:52:12.240]  don't understand how much that really should mean to the community, because,
[01:52:13.560 --> 01:52:15.440]  again, if nobody gives a shit about your award,
[01:52:15.440 --> 01:52:17.440]  then what is the point of having an award show?
[01:52:17.440 --> 01:52:19.800]  And that's what a lot of people have realized.
[01:52:20.320 --> 01:52:22.360]  Maybe not in Oklahoma, but definitely in Denver.
[01:52:22.360 --> 01:52:24.680]  Like there are a lot of people that are trying to do the same thing you've done.
[01:52:24.680 --> 01:52:27.240]  Greg, some people were successful for a few years.
[01:52:27.800 --> 01:52:30.120]  Some people, unfortunately, passed away.
[01:52:30.120 --> 01:52:32.000]  But but the the community
[01:52:33.160 --> 01:52:36.400]  telling you the truth from the community is longing for something
[01:52:36.640 --> 01:52:38.200]  like what you guys are doing.
[01:52:38.200 --> 01:52:41.640]  And it needs to be, you know, maybe even doing a regional thing
[01:52:41.640 --> 01:52:43.960]  and then making it hype. So it's a national thing.
[01:52:44.800 --> 01:52:48.320]  But again, you guys have to say you guys are going to have to be like
[01:52:48.320 --> 01:52:49.720]  with with the home growers.
[01:52:49.720 --> 01:52:51.960]  I mean, these are things that you're probably going to have to
[01:52:52.480 --> 01:52:57.200]  to make hard decisions on, because if you choose to be with certain individuals,
[01:52:58.240 --> 01:52:59.520]  you know, hats off to you.
[01:52:59.520 --> 01:53:02.640]  You know, I mean, those are your business decisions.
[01:53:02.920 --> 01:53:06.360]  But the old school individuals aren't going to rock with people
[01:53:06.360 --> 01:53:09.920]  that partner up with individuals that didn't take any risk back in the day
[01:53:10.440 --> 01:53:13.520]  or or or they feel like all they're basically doing is
[01:53:13.720 --> 01:53:16.920]  now that the coast is clear, they're coming out and trying to monetize
[01:53:17.160 --> 01:53:20.000]  on culture, on a variety of things.
[01:53:20.320 --> 01:53:22.280]  You know, we could get into it.
[01:53:22.280 --> 01:53:23.680]  I got to be a whole nother show.
[01:53:23.720 --> 01:53:28.320]  But but but the old school, like when they feel a certain way or they
[01:53:29.280 --> 01:53:31.880]  their voice matters still, it carries in that.
[01:53:31.880 --> 01:53:35.200]  I think a lot of people still listen to certain individuals in our community.
[01:53:35.480 --> 01:53:39.360]  So if they say, you know, fuck X, Y, Z, best believe
[01:53:39.360 --> 01:53:41.040]  that there's a lot of people in the community,
[01:53:41.040 --> 01:53:44.560]  maybe not even understanding fully what happened is riding with that.
[01:53:44.560 --> 01:53:46.880]  It's like, all right, fuck X, Y, Z.
[01:53:46.880 --> 01:53:50.080]  And that's another probably, you know, shooting ourself in the foot
[01:53:50.080 --> 01:53:53.200]  sometimes with the cannabis industry is that we don't take the time
[01:53:53.200 --> 01:53:57.520]  to find out what really happened or again, people don't normally
[01:53:57.520 --> 01:53:58.760]  want to always talk about stuff.
[01:53:58.760 --> 01:54:01.240]  So it's hard to find out what really happened.
[01:54:01.240 --> 01:54:01.960]  Yeah, it's funny.
[01:54:01.960 --> 01:54:04.600]  You could get on the like not even the wrong side,
[01:54:04.600 --> 01:54:08.040]  but you can end up in a situation where now only half the people like you
[01:54:08.040 --> 01:54:11.880]  just because you ended up doing this, where you stay kind of in the middle.
[01:54:11.880 --> 01:54:14.880]  You get all the people and, you know, just kind of,
[01:54:15.520 --> 01:54:17.560]  you know, just something to put out there, you know.
[01:54:18.760 --> 01:54:19.760]  I get it.
[01:54:19.760 --> 01:54:22.440]  Is there a big name and you're like, yeah,
[01:54:22.440 --> 01:54:24.440]  Ganja wants to come on and be part of this?
[01:54:24.440 --> 01:54:25.120]  Well, that's true.
[01:54:25.120 --> 01:54:28.120]  But then you guys might, you know, didn't know kind of the other deal.
[01:54:28.120 --> 01:54:29.120]  And so I got going on.
[01:54:29.120 --> 01:54:33.360]  So sure. Not knocking them or nothing, but you know how it is.
[01:54:33.720 --> 01:54:35.720]  You get everything aside.
[01:54:35.720 --> 01:54:36.360]  You know what I mean?
[01:54:36.360 --> 01:54:37.960]  Like, yeah.
[01:54:37.960 --> 01:54:41.560]  Yeah. Speaking of speaking of how it is, I've been
[01:54:42.160 --> 01:54:44.640]  kind of zoning out here on chat where we're
[01:54:44.640 --> 01:54:48.040]  we're somewhat accused of having kid gloves today.
[01:54:48.360 --> 01:54:50.360]  What do they want to ask?
[01:54:50.360 --> 01:54:52.800]  So, well, here's here's one question.
[01:54:52.800 --> 01:54:56.400]  This is where the samples jarred up by the Ganja.
[01:54:56.440 --> 01:54:58.120]  No, they already said that.
[01:54:58.120 --> 01:54:59.120]  Yeah, I know.
[01:54:59.120 --> 01:55:02.120]  And a lot of these questions I'm trying to type them into chat
[01:55:02.120 --> 01:55:05.840]  if they watched the whole show available on replay.
[01:55:05.960 --> 01:55:07.400]  But I think they don't know.
[01:55:07.400 --> 01:55:08.200]  I don't think.
[01:55:08.200 --> 01:55:13.680]  Hey, to be fair, we even gave Oki Grower part of the platform last week.
[01:55:13.720 --> 01:55:15.560]  He popped on for like two seconds.
[01:55:15.600 --> 01:55:17.080]  He was waiting for us.
[01:55:17.080 --> 01:55:21.360]  We were waiting for Greg to finish his conversation, you know,
[01:55:21.360 --> 01:55:23.640]  and then we're going to highlight him.
[01:55:23.640 --> 01:55:27.560]  So again, dude, you can't you can't just come on here like that, too.
[01:55:27.560 --> 01:55:29.400]  That's that's disrespectful as well.
[01:55:29.400 --> 01:55:31.400]  No, we were going to get to that's why.
[01:55:31.400 --> 01:55:32.720]  That's why I'm calling it.
[01:55:32.720 --> 01:55:33.400]  But you know what?
[01:55:33.400 --> 01:55:35.520]  Like I said in chat, there is going to be a part three.
[01:55:35.520 --> 01:55:38.120]  So again, guys, we're not done with the conversation.
[01:55:38.360 --> 01:55:42.200]  We're just trying to approach this in like a respectful manner
[01:55:42.720 --> 01:55:43.440]  in a calm manner.
[01:55:43.440 --> 01:55:46.160]  And I'm sorry if that appears like kid gloves, but we've.
[01:55:46.720 --> 01:55:47.520]  OK, OK.
[01:55:47.520 --> 01:55:50.680]  So we've asked we've asked some questions.
[01:55:50.720 --> 01:55:51.760]  Here's Oki Grower.
[01:55:51.760 --> 01:55:54.640]  He said now that's a lie because he's a ganja.
[01:55:54.640 --> 01:55:57.520]  OK, we just found out the dude got his ganja.
[01:55:57.760 --> 01:55:59.240]  Sure. The other owner.
[01:55:59.240 --> 01:56:01.960]  He's saying that's a lie because the other guy left.
[01:56:01.960 --> 01:56:04.240]  Daniel is a ganja.
[01:56:04.240 --> 01:56:07.000]  So now he's saying ganja did a jar to sell.
[01:56:07.360 --> 01:56:10.520]  OK. And here here is, you know, you see what I'm saying?
[01:56:10.520 --> 01:56:13.120]  That's the that that's that's not we don't need that.
[01:56:13.120 --> 01:56:14.600]  We don't know.
[01:56:14.600 --> 01:56:18.640]  But here here is a good question, because we kind of we kind of asked about this.
[01:56:18.640 --> 01:56:22.080]  And, you know, again, Brandon was on part one.
[01:56:22.320 --> 01:56:23.880]  I'm definitely sure.
[01:56:23.880 --> 01:56:26.720]  Hopefully we'll have him back because he's an integral part of this.
[01:56:27.480 --> 01:56:30.800]  But why actual no JPEG images of the mold?
[01:56:30.880 --> 01:56:32.000]  Fair question.
[01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:34.120]  That is a good question.
[01:56:34.680 --> 01:56:37.080]  I I can't answer that question.
[01:56:37.640 --> 01:56:39.000]  I had really nothing.
[01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:41.960]  No aspect of that is again, I'm the I'm the vendor coordinator
[01:56:41.960 --> 01:56:43.680]  when it came to the competition.
[01:56:43.680 --> 01:56:45.440]  I was not real privy to all that.
[01:56:45.440 --> 01:56:48.560]  I actually asked to be removed
[01:56:48.960 --> 01:56:52.240]  from any knowledge because I deal with all the vendors. Right.
[01:56:52.240 --> 01:56:54.560]  And so I wanted to be able to look them in their eye and tell them,
[01:56:54.560 --> 01:56:56.080]  I don't know where you're at.
[01:56:56.080 --> 01:56:59.520]  So I can't necessarily answer that question
[01:57:00.080 --> 01:57:02.360]  as to even what is available. So.
[01:57:02.680 --> 01:57:07.240]  Yep. And just recalling back to earlier, we asked Derek did address it
[01:57:07.240 --> 01:57:09.240]  because I said, you know, where's the pictures?
[01:57:09.240 --> 01:57:11.160]  Everybody loves pictures.
[01:57:11.160 --> 01:57:13.240]  So he said that pictures do exist.
[01:57:13.240 --> 01:57:15.880]  I asked if it was a conflict of interest
[01:57:16.520 --> 01:57:20.440]  with contract wise between vendor and business partner, whether they could,
[01:57:20.640 --> 01:57:24.840]  whether you could release the pictures without their approval,
[01:57:24.840 --> 01:57:26.760]  because, again, that could damage some businesses.
[01:57:28.760 --> 01:57:31.880]  And there was no firm agreement in place there,
[01:57:31.880 --> 01:57:35.680]  but I don't exactly remember when or how those images were going to be made
[01:57:35.680 --> 01:57:39.440]  available because, again, even if they are made available
[01:57:39.600 --> 01:57:42.800]  and they do show mold, which I would love to see made available
[01:57:42.800 --> 01:57:45.600]  and I would love to see them show mold or other contaminants,
[01:57:45.800 --> 01:57:50.000]  it still doesn't solve the question of why does it show it there
[01:57:50.120 --> 01:57:53.560]  versus the COAs that they submitted that say they don't have it?
[01:57:53.560 --> 01:57:54.840]  So there's still that problem.
[01:57:54.840 --> 01:57:57.120]  Even if we get to mold, you can still nitpick.
[01:57:57.120 --> 01:58:00.600]  Well, OK, well, where does it actually happen in that chain of custody?
[01:58:00.600 --> 01:58:03.680]  So that's that's kind of my two cents on that one.
[01:58:04.920 --> 01:58:07.360]  I saw a couple of pictures floating around.
[01:58:07.360 --> 01:58:10.600]  I thought it was like there was something saying, here's some bug poop.
[01:58:10.760 --> 01:58:12.200]  Here's the I don't know.
[01:58:12.200 --> 01:58:14.080]  Maybe it was on the Ganja.
[01:58:14.080 --> 01:58:16.320]  We were showing something from them last week.
[01:58:18.040 --> 01:58:18.560]  I don't know.
[01:58:18.560 --> 01:58:21.400]  But yeah, I haven't seen like here's all the pictures, you know,
[01:58:21.400 --> 01:58:23.760]  like I just remember that.
[01:58:23.760 --> 01:58:25.920]  But I thought I saw a couple of them floating around.
[01:58:26.560 --> 01:58:27.520]  I think he did.
[01:58:27.520 --> 01:58:31.840]  I think he addressed some of that at thirty four forty nine.
[01:58:35.470 --> 01:58:38.030]  And Brandon bring brings up a good point.
[01:58:38.030 --> 01:58:41.630]  And again, that's why I think some people don't want to come on here
[01:58:41.630 --> 01:58:43.350]  and answer certain stuff because it doesn't.
[01:58:45.350 --> 01:58:47.270]  You know, you look into certain stuff
[01:58:47.270 --> 01:58:50.550]  and then if something else doesn't make sense, it piques your interest.
[01:58:51.870 --> 01:58:55.190]  And that's why, too, you know, with the three the three hour show,
[01:58:55.910 --> 01:58:58.790]  sometimes those things just kind of naturally come out.
[01:58:58.790 --> 01:59:01.350]  But you said thirty four thirty nine.
[01:59:01.350 --> 01:59:03.270]  Thirty four forty nine.
[01:59:03.270 --> 01:59:05.670]  Forty nine. OK, well.
[01:59:06.590 --> 01:59:09.270]  I'll get you close there.
[01:59:09.630 --> 01:59:11.630]  Oh, I did. I bumped it.
[01:59:12.230 --> 01:59:15.430]  I don't think we were debating if there was some mold.
[01:59:15.430 --> 01:59:18.350]  Well, are we are we debating there was no mold?
[01:59:18.710 --> 01:59:20.990]  Well, I think it was the chain of custody.
[01:59:21.030 --> 01:59:23.550]  OK, yeah, I thought there is a greed, you know.
[01:59:23.550 --> 01:59:25.310]  Hey, at the end, there was mold.
[01:59:25.310 --> 01:59:28.430]  Now it's like where now?
[01:59:28.430 --> 01:59:31.550]  OK, let me let me play this clip for you under microscope.
[01:59:32.030 --> 01:59:33.830]  You found mold.
[01:59:34.750 --> 01:59:37.190]  I mean, that's the short of it. Yes.
[01:59:37.830 --> 01:59:40.790]  Well, it's also it's also good that you guys spotted it
[01:59:40.790 --> 01:59:42.070]  because there's plenty of people out there
[01:59:42.070 --> 01:59:43.750]  that just don't know what they're looking for. Right.
[01:59:43.750 --> 01:59:44.550]  They look under microscope.
[01:59:44.550 --> 01:59:46.270]  They're like, it looks really close.
[01:59:46.270 --> 01:59:48.710]  Hey, man. And I'm curious.
[01:59:48.750 --> 01:59:51.110]  The truth is not many people
[01:59:51.550 --> 01:59:55.550]  take a very close look at the cannabis before they consume it.
[01:59:56.430 --> 02:00:00.430]  Each of our gangiers gets a jeweler's loop,
[02:00:00.590 --> 02:00:03.790]  professional quality jeweler's loop during their training
[02:00:04.390 --> 02:00:06.750]  and learn how to apply that jeweler's loop
[02:00:06.750 --> 02:00:10.990]  and in the most effective manner to confirm there's no contaminants on the sample.
[02:00:11.310 --> 02:00:14.230]  A couple of our certified gangiers
[02:00:14.950 --> 02:00:17.150]  for this event brought along some additional
[02:00:18.110 --> 02:00:20.390]  microscope tools that they had.
[02:00:20.390 --> 02:00:22.790]  It's got the little screen and it's got the microscope.
[02:00:23.550 --> 02:00:25.230]  Can they document that stuff?
[02:00:25.230 --> 02:00:28.910]  Because I think that'd be great if like that'd be great for you guys
[02:00:28.910 --> 02:00:32.310]  if you could have that to be like, look, this is what we saw.
[02:00:32.310 --> 02:00:35.870]  And it's actually pretty, pretty apparent in these in these images
[02:00:35.870 --> 02:00:36.750]  that we were able to take.
[02:00:36.750 --> 02:00:37.790]  Well, they did document.
[02:00:37.790 --> 02:00:40.390]  I think I saw some some online images.
[02:00:40.430 --> 02:00:43.030]  OK, were those were those images of the competition
[02:00:43.030 --> 02:00:46.190]  or were they just stock images? I didn't know.
[02:00:46.230 --> 02:00:46.710]  No, no.
[02:00:46.710 --> 02:00:50.270]  This is images of each of the samples
[02:00:51.070 --> 02:00:54.230]  that were disqualified based on the contamination that we saw.
[02:00:54.510 --> 02:00:57.390]  Yeah. Where are those, Mr.
[02:00:57.390 --> 02:00:59.390]  Derrick? Right. Where are those?
[02:00:59.990 --> 02:01:01.470]  OK. OK, that's it.
[02:01:01.470 --> 02:01:04.030]  That's the other kind of like part of the smoking gun thing
[02:01:04.030 --> 02:01:06.670]  when someone's live on air, kind of saying certain things.
[02:01:06.670 --> 02:01:09.750]  And then when they're off air, what's really going on behind the scenes?
[02:01:10.070 --> 02:01:12.910]  And so this kind of stuff needs to be highlighted. No.
[02:01:14.590 --> 02:01:16.110]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:01:16.870 --> 02:01:19.110]  I think there was another highlighted point, if you want to.
[02:01:19.150 --> 02:01:21.310]  It was thirty four or three.
[02:01:21.310 --> 02:01:23.750]  OK, let me go back here.
[02:01:24.150 --> 02:01:25.670]  I mean, everybody's got a loop.
[02:01:26.030 --> 02:01:29.510]  I mean, it's a little talking down on people like, damn, you're growing.
[02:01:29.510 --> 02:01:31.630]  I mean, shit, who doesn't have a loop?
[02:01:33.150 --> 02:01:36.430]  Well, and to you know, we were talking earlier and the,
[02:01:36.950 --> 02:01:41.590]  you know, I guess for lack of a better term, the civilian judges at the contest,
[02:01:41.590 --> 02:01:44.750]  they were given a course taught by Swami.
[02:01:44.750 --> 02:01:45.710]  They were given loops.
[02:01:45.710 --> 02:01:47.830]  They should have been able to look at it.
[02:01:47.830 --> 02:01:51.910]  Some of the judges secondhand to me have said, yes,
[02:01:51.910 --> 02:01:54.030]  there were some contaminants in there.
[02:01:54.070 --> 02:01:57.350]  It'd be great if they want to step up and come on maybe part three.
[02:01:58.750 --> 02:02:00.630]  But again, that's that.
[02:02:00.630 --> 02:02:03.750]  Let me get to the video here.
[02:02:04.590 --> 02:02:05.510]  Play for you.
[02:02:05.510 --> 02:02:10.190]  Have you ever I mean, or is this the just tell me about the history of judging?
[02:02:10.190 --> 02:02:12.870]  Just so I can understand, because I'm curious.
[02:02:14.630 --> 02:02:16.670]  The question for me. Yeah.
[02:02:16.670 --> 02:02:20.270]  Oh, this was our first opportunity
[02:02:20.550 --> 02:02:24.710]  to apply our skills as assessors
[02:02:24.950 --> 02:02:28.590]  at a competition as a group.
[02:02:28.750 --> 02:02:31.990]  I know individual ganglia's have been applying their skills
[02:02:32.430 --> 02:02:36.350]  for the last couple of years, but this was the first time as a group.
[02:02:36.350 --> 02:02:39.350]  We were asked to come in and
[02:02:40.630 --> 02:02:43.270]  and collaborate with with the Cowboy Cup
[02:02:44.270 --> 02:02:46.830]  to assign the order of those top 15.
[02:02:47.310 --> 02:02:52.710]  OK, so you were handed 15 samples and you did your thing under microscope.
[02:02:53.230 --> 02:02:54.710]  You found mold.
[02:02:56.110 --> 02:02:58.710]  I mean, that's the shorter. Yes.
[02:03:01.590 --> 02:03:05.630]  So most of those microscopes that they're talking about
[02:03:05.630 --> 02:03:09.110]  bringing in a high level microscope that you can easily take a photo of that.
[02:03:09.430 --> 02:03:13.230]  So like this, this could be cleared up with just a few posts
[02:03:13.430 --> 02:03:16.430]  of microscopic photos of all of that.
[02:03:16.670 --> 02:03:19.710]  And I guess that's part of the community.
[02:03:19.710 --> 02:03:22.670]  I guess if you're talking not having kid gloves or whatever,
[02:03:22.990 --> 02:03:25.190]  I feel like we've asked them direct questions.
[02:03:25.190 --> 02:03:28.990]  The only other stuff that we can ask you directly outside of the concierge
[02:03:28.990 --> 02:03:33.190]  individuals is is like how it was stored, those those things.
[02:03:33.190 --> 02:03:35.590]  And I feel like we've we've addressed that.
[02:03:35.590 --> 02:03:38.910]  If other individuals have questions, put them in the chat.
[02:03:38.910 --> 02:03:41.950]  From this point forward, I mean, I think I think some people.
[02:03:44.430 --> 02:03:47.470]  It's it is kind of it is kind of odd that
[02:03:48.070 --> 02:03:51.630]  professionals that are doing this, they're in metric, they're selling cannabis
[02:03:51.630 --> 02:03:56.030]  on a on probably the public meeting up probably on a weekly or maybe
[02:03:56.030 --> 02:04:00.190]  a bimonthly basis, all that cannabis is passing, going through.
[02:04:00.430 --> 02:04:04.110]  And then this stuff fails that that.
[02:04:04.110 --> 02:04:06.910]  That could obviously be be exactly what happened.
[02:04:06.910 --> 02:04:10.470]  But from from saying like, well, there's certain ways that we're not really
[02:04:10.470 --> 02:04:14.790]  100 percent sure on how we did SOPs from A to Z.
[02:04:14.790 --> 02:04:16.990]  We need to improve on that, have a standard metric.
[02:04:17.590 --> 02:04:20.030]  That's again, sir, where I feel like you're going to have to do some damage
[02:04:20.030 --> 02:04:23.270]  control with individuals and maybe talk to them on a personal level
[02:04:23.550 --> 02:04:25.710]  so that they see that you're willing to do that.
[02:04:26.270 --> 02:04:28.670]  Because I know from my side,
[02:04:28.670 --> 02:04:31.230]  I know that there's a lot of people that are in the public
[02:04:31.550 --> 02:04:36.390]  because I know from my side, I don't know if everybody realizes that yet.
[02:04:36.390 --> 02:04:39.350]  I don't know if everybody realizes that you're giving them their money back.
[02:04:39.630 --> 02:04:44.190]  So maybe just, you know, taking the time to make a few phone calls
[02:04:44.190 --> 02:04:48.670]  will also create maybe save an event that that looked like
[02:04:48.670 --> 02:04:50.790]  a lot of individuals were wanting to get behind.
[02:04:51.750 --> 02:04:52.590]  Sure, sure.
[02:04:54.150 --> 02:04:58.070]  Here's one for you to question from chat and
[02:04:59.070 --> 02:05:02.110]  it's to be fair, not to put you on blast, Brandon,
[02:05:02.110 --> 02:05:04.870]  if you can maybe help answer this question as well.
[02:05:05.670 --> 02:05:09.950]  So it was something that we we touched on earlier in the conversation.
[02:05:10.590 --> 02:05:13.710]  But the question here was ask him if he thinks it's possible
[02:05:13.710 --> 02:05:16.630]  that storage and handling could have caused contamination.
[02:05:16.910 --> 02:05:21.070]  And I want to add to that and this, too, to the growers that also failed.
[02:05:21.230 --> 02:05:25.870]  Again, like I said, these reports, they have moisture content on there.
[02:05:26.670 --> 02:05:31.350]  You guys are saying some of them, one of them at least had a 14.7%
[02:05:31.870 --> 02:05:35.190]  moisture content. A couple had 10% moisture content.
[02:05:35.190 --> 02:05:43.790]  So in the storage, in your opinion, in the storage and handling of a 14.7%
[02:05:43.790 --> 02:05:47.310]  bud in the conditions where the jars weren't open,
[02:05:47.310 --> 02:05:51.390]  where they were stored for a duration of overnight, was it?
[02:05:51.390 --> 02:05:54.430]  Or it was two weeks before the gonjias got their packs?
[02:05:55.030 --> 02:05:57.070]  Correct. Two weeks before the gonjias got their packs.
[02:05:57.070 --> 02:06:00.670]  OK, so I guess the question is to everybody in chat,
[02:06:00.670 --> 02:06:03.630]  the growers and to you, because you're the one on camera.
[02:06:04.990 --> 02:06:09.150]  Is it possible for under those conditions for mold to form?
[02:06:10.270 --> 02:06:12.430]  Where there wasn't a trace of it before?
[02:06:13.030 --> 02:06:17.630]  Not being... I'm not an expert on that kind of stuff, right?
[02:06:17.630 --> 02:06:20.110]  So let's just say that to start this out.
[02:06:21.030 --> 02:06:22.910]  But could could that happen?
[02:06:24.550 --> 02:06:30.190]  Sure, I suppose. I mean, moisture, that's how mold grows, right?
[02:06:30.190 --> 02:06:33.390]  Is having moisture in the right settings.
[02:06:33.390 --> 02:06:38.510]  And so if it created the right settings for that, then yeah, I suppose that it could.
[02:06:42.420 --> 02:06:45.940]  Am I certain that that's going to happen?
[02:06:45.940 --> 02:06:49.100]  I'm not certain because I'm not an expert on it, but yeah, absolutely.
[02:06:49.620 --> 02:06:53.740]  Do you agree that those are those are settings that could cause that kind of deal?
[02:06:54.140 --> 02:06:57.300]  Yeah. And again, I'm not an expert here either, but that's
[02:06:58.060 --> 02:07:02.500]  that really seems like the crux of the question of is that something we can answer?
[02:07:02.500 --> 02:07:07.220]  And, you know, if somebody turned in a sample with their COA
[02:07:07.860 --> 02:07:11.340]  that passed for, you know, molds and contaminants,
[02:07:12.100 --> 02:07:16.860]  if they had a really low moisture content and they still had mold
[02:07:17.980 --> 02:07:21.740]  in the judging, please let us know because we'd love to know that, too.
[02:07:21.740 --> 02:07:23.580]  Well, and I can't and I don't know.
[02:07:23.580 --> 02:07:27.940]  Again, we had some of them failed for various different contaminations.
[02:07:27.940 --> 02:07:32.980]  And so I don't know which one failed for what particular reasoning, you know.
[02:07:33.020 --> 02:07:35.940]  But that has to be documented somewhere like you guys just didn't pass.
[02:07:36.700 --> 02:07:40.460]  I'm sure it is. Again, it's one of those deals where, you know, I deal with
[02:07:41.300 --> 02:07:43.460]  I deal with all the faces, right?
[02:07:43.740 --> 02:07:48.620]  Those are there. And so I basically washed my hands of any of as much knowledge
[02:07:48.620 --> 02:07:51.700]  as I could on winners and things like that, because I wanted to be able
[02:07:51.700 --> 02:07:53.740]  to be honest with these guys and tell them I didn't know.
[02:07:54.260 --> 02:07:56.340]  So, OK, and I'm going to look through here.
[02:07:56.460 --> 02:07:58.180]  OK, grower had a question of.
[02:07:58.180 --> 02:08:00.020]  So let me get in here.
[02:08:00.020 --> 02:08:02.020]  OK, you can get in there later.
[02:08:02.020 --> 02:08:04.260]  Oh, OK. I'm sorry. We'll get to it. I'll start it.
[02:08:04.420 --> 02:08:06.140]  I got a question.
[02:08:06.140 --> 02:08:08.140]  So from the time when
[02:08:09.100 --> 02:08:12.380]  so from the time when the samples were received,
[02:08:12.380 --> 02:08:14.420]  how many days until the lab got them?
[02:08:15.020 --> 02:08:18.020]  Because if they were received today
[02:08:18.260 --> 02:08:21.460]  and then they were fine, there was no mold today,
[02:08:21.460 --> 02:08:24.100]  and then they go in a jar for three to three weeks,
[02:08:24.300 --> 02:08:28.180]  that could change from lab tests to opening that jar.
[02:08:28.180 --> 02:08:29.660]  And I'm not sure.
[02:08:29.660 --> 02:08:32.700]  I mean, individuals got their own testing, right?
[02:08:32.700 --> 02:08:35.940]  These these contestants got their own testing done
[02:08:35.940 --> 02:08:39.420]  and then brought that brought the testing to us with their sample.
[02:08:39.420 --> 02:08:43.140]  So I can't speak on when they got their testing done,
[02:08:43.140 --> 02:08:45.340]  got their testing done to when they turn their samples in.
[02:08:45.940 --> 02:08:51.340]  I do know that we did have a couple of people that pushed to the last minute
[02:08:51.340 --> 02:08:54.700]  for to make sure testing would get completed because testing was kind of
[02:08:55.020 --> 02:08:56.780]  lagging at the time.
[02:08:56.780 --> 02:09:00.500]  So I would assume that a couple of them
[02:09:00.900 --> 02:09:04.940]  were not too far previous and then some of them probably had them a little sooner.
[02:09:04.940 --> 02:09:09.620]  So. But I can't speak on that simply because they.
[02:09:09.620 --> 02:09:12.980]  OK, so so then along those same lines,
[02:09:14.980 --> 02:09:17.420]  all right, if I took it to the lab, I felt like,
[02:09:17.740 --> 02:09:20.780]  like kind of everybody's saying I get what we're with you, OK?
[02:09:20.780 --> 02:09:22.180]  We see where we kind of get it.
[02:09:22.180 --> 02:09:27.340]  But my whole thing is I can't make a judgment on whether or not
[02:09:27.340 --> 02:09:32.620]  this was a planned, calculated move like our oh, shit, they all got mold.
[02:09:32.620 --> 02:09:35.900]  Now is the time to jump in and let them know they got to have
[02:09:35.900 --> 02:09:39.380]  or they need our services, you know, I mean, to where you take in that issue
[02:09:39.380 --> 02:09:41.500]  and try to convert it into dollars.
[02:09:41.660 --> 02:09:44.660]  And that's where the people will see that.
[02:09:44.900 --> 02:09:48.020]  You know, and I think that's probably where half the people got the issue.
[02:09:48.580 --> 02:09:53.020]  One. And, you know, as we were saying, we've got so many different angles on this.
[02:09:53.020 --> 02:09:57.460]  Right. That that's a completely separate angle from SOPs
[02:09:57.460 --> 02:09:59.940]  and handling procedures and all of that,
[02:10:00.700 --> 02:10:06.460]  which really is more our focus on how do we improve this business for Oklahoma?
[02:10:06.500 --> 02:10:08.420]  You know, how do we improve the event?
[02:10:08.420 --> 02:10:10.260]  How do we improve the competition?
[02:10:10.260 --> 02:10:14.140]  How do we become a little more transparent with our SOPs
[02:10:14.140 --> 02:10:17.260]  so that people understand 100%
[02:10:17.260 --> 02:10:19.660]  what their product what's going to happen with their product?
[02:10:19.700 --> 02:10:22.820]  You know, I mean, and so, yeah.
[02:10:23.700 --> 02:10:26.100]  Step one is just throwing in salt, everybody.
[02:10:26.100 --> 02:10:27.700]  That's right. Right.
[02:10:27.700 --> 02:10:32.700]  Hey, Mark. Mark, this your question was addressed one thirty nine fifty.
[02:10:33.100 --> 02:10:35.020]  Oh, yeah. OK.
[02:10:35.060 --> 02:10:40.660]  Wow. While I search notes, while I search for one thirty nine fifty real quick,
[02:10:40.900 --> 02:10:43.060]  I'm just going to toss this out there.
[02:10:43.060 --> 02:10:45.020]  I'm going to go to the other screen real quick.
[02:10:45.020 --> 02:10:46.820]  I'm like for one thirty nine fifty.
[02:10:46.820 --> 02:10:48.260]  All right. There's one.
[02:10:48.260 --> 02:10:51.980]  They said they stayed at the lettuce factory, I believe, is what I heard.
[02:10:52.780 --> 02:10:55.780]  Which which would honestly make sense because of metric.
[02:10:56.500 --> 02:10:57.700]  You can't take that shit.
[02:10:57.700 --> 02:10:59.620]  You can't just be driving in your car with.
[02:10:59.620 --> 02:11:02.540]  Yeah, no. All the tags and stuff.
[02:11:02.660 --> 02:11:05.300]  Well, I don't know.
[02:11:05.740 --> 02:11:07.860]  I don't know where that came from, but you know what?
[02:11:07.860 --> 02:11:10.900]  I am just trying to get your voice again.
[02:11:10.900 --> 02:11:12.540]  OK, you're welcome to come on.
[02:11:12.540 --> 02:11:14.540]  This is going to be a multi-part thing.
[02:11:14.540 --> 02:11:16.780]  I don't want you to feel like we're ignoring you.
[02:11:17.740 --> 02:11:20.700]  We're really trying to be fair here.
[02:11:20.700 --> 02:11:24.980]  So, OK, let me get to the slide.
[02:11:25.180 --> 02:11:30.180]  Let me hide that comment, share my screen and hit play.
[02:11:31.140 --> 02:11:34.420]  That's right. I was like, oh, my God, the show's going to be nuts
[02:11:34.420 --> 02:11:36.540]  because it is already like, we're here for.
[02:11:36.580 --> 02:11:39.660]  I mean, the thing is, there's a lot of people in the chat.
[02:11:39.980 --> 02:11:41.060]  Yeah, a lot. A lot.
[02:11:41.060 --> 02:11:43.220]  At the end of the at the end of the day.
[02:11:43.220 --> 02:11:48.020]  Yeah, it's it's when you put it in a jar for two weeks.
[02:11:48.180 --> 02:11:49.500]  November 7th, they said.
[02:11:49.500 --> 02:11:51.820]  And you don't maintain like you have to burp it.
[02:11:51.820 --> 02:11:53.220]  You got to burp those.
[02:11:53.220 --> 02:11:55.540]  If no one's burping it, because what?
[02:11:55.540 --> 02:11:59.620]  Or or have it in a fray, like at least have it below 50 degrees.
[02:11:59.740 --> 02:12:03.220]  That's like there's got to be documented bags.
[02:12:04.500 --> 02:12:08.260]  My dad asked for like holding in the.
[02:12:09.940 --> 02:12:12.100]  OK, sorry.
[02:12:12.100 --> 02:12:14.260]  Sorry for holding in the water.
[02:12:14.260 --> 02:12:14.940]  That's good.
[02:12:14.940 --> 02:12:16.500]  I'm talking.
[02:12:18.020 --> 02:12:20.940]  They're all looking at it like that because that's a sponsor for them.
[02:12:21.260 --> 02:12:23.260]  So that's what that's what we mean by this.
[02:12:24.540 --> 02:12:26.380]  We're just here having conversations, baby.
[02:12:26.380 --> 02:12:28.500]  We don't make our money from anybody outside of that.
[02:12:29.180 --> 02:12:33.220]  And I think that's again why hopefully this will continue where Mr.
[02:12:33.220 --> 02:12:36.060]  Westport is coming with with fantastic information.
[02:12:36.060 --> 02:12:39.420]  Marco, as usual, I hope you guys see that I did my homework as well
[02:12:39.420 --> 02:12:41.460]  so that we did come with correct questions.
[02:12:41.660 --> 02:12:45.220]  Some of the other bigger stuff that came out of light.
[02:12:45.820 --> 02:12:49.220]  This gentleman doesn't have really anything to do with other than maybe
[02:12:49.220 --> 02:12:49.940]  in the future.
[02:12:49.940 --> 02:12:52.940]  And I guess that, you know, you and Daniel can decide that on your own.
[02:12:53.700 --> 02:12:57.620]  But, you know, the community always is watching, man.
[02:12:57.620 --> 02:12:59.380]  You can't fool them.
[02:12:59.380 --> 02:13:03.620]  And so that's that's something that I think, you know, around the country,
[02:13:03.620 --> 02:13:06.740]  some people realize and that's why we always joke that those individuals
[02:13:06.740 --> 02:13:09.620]  are the suits because they always think they're smarter than the hoodies.
[02:13:10.500 --> 02:13:13.060]  And usually it blows up in their face.
[02:13:14.060 --> 02:13:15.420]  Oklahomans ain't no joke, man.
[02:13:15.420 --> 02:13:17.060]  We stand together.
[02:13:17.060 --> 02:13:20.820]  We ride with Oklahoma when something goes on around here.
[02:13:20.820 --> 02:13:23.340]  It's Oklahoma strong, Stillwater strong.
[02:13:23.340 --> 02:13:25.500]  It's Oklahoma City strong.
[02:13:25.500 --> 02:13:26.740]  I mean, we ride together.
[02:13:26.740 --> 02:13:30.020]  And so, you know, what you're saying about community, Oklahoma's
[02:13:31.020 --> 02:13:33.580]  Oklahoma's always had that even before we had this community.
[02:13:33.580 --> 02:13:36.260]  I mean, we've just always kind of rode together. So.
[02:13:40.060 --> 02:13:41.900]  I want to get into some questions.
[02:13:41.900 --> 02:13:44.060]  I saw that those were starting to pile up there a little bit.
[02:13:46.540 --> 02:13:48.940]  These I actually did have a few of them
[02:13:50.300 --> 02:13:51.140]  marked here.
[02:13:51.140 --> 02:13:54.580]  They were just kind of more of conversation points.
[02:13:55.300 --> 02:13:57.780]  But yeah, let me just get to them here.
[02:13:58.540 --> 02:14:00.940]  And again, I wish we had Daniel still on
[02:14:01.620 --> 02:14:04.140]  because he might be able to answer some of these more.
[02:14:04.140 --> 02:14:08.780]  But Rusty Nails says 19 of 40 with previous COAs were all contaminated.
[02:14:11.420 --> 02:14:14.940]  Now it was 10 out of 12 for the outdoor, and
[02:14:15.940 --> 02:14:18.180]  I'm not sure, do those numbers add up?
[02:14:18.340 --> 02:14:22.300]  No, we I mean, we only had 20 total sungrown entries outdoor
[02:14:22.300 --> 02:14:25.020]  and sungrown light assist. So. OK.
[02:14:25.740 --> 02:14:30.380]  OK. And then that's the reason sometimes I didn't get to some of these questions,
[02:14:30.380 --> 02:14:34.140]  people, because they kind of have to make sense, at least in my head,
[02:14:34.140 --> 02:14:36.260]  before I'm going to ask it to somebody else.
[02:14:38.220 --> 02:14:40.460]  And then there was you know, there's comments like this.
[02:14:40.460 --> 02:14:43.540]  Why did Patrick release three statements on I.G.?
[02:14:44.140 --> 02:14:47.100]  But no one released one from the Cowboy Cup.
[02:14:48.820 --> 02:14:53.460]  You're here today. You were on done show, but did you really not want to do text?
[02:14:53.860 --> 02:14:58.420]  We released a statement on Instagram as well. OK. OK.
[02:14:58.700 --> 02:15:02.820]  I think I think you guys actually read our statement on the
[02:15:03.100 --> 02:15:05.340]  the last week's Wednesday podcast.
[02:15:05.860 --> 02:15:09.940]  Yep. Yep. So again, sometimes people are accusing me
[02:15:09.940 --> 02:15:11.780]  of not getting their questions up, but.
[02:15:12.140 --> 02:15:14.460]  Well, we love we love Neverwinter Farms.
[02:15:14.460 --> 02:15:15.860]  He's a genuine human being.
[02:15:15.860 --> 02:15:19.020]  So I want you to know that I think on the flip side of things, buddy,
[02:15:19.260 --> 02:15:22.460]  it's the fact that Patrick doesn't want to come on the show.
[02:15:22.460 --> 02:15:25.820]  Other people don't want to come on the show where these individuals did.
[02:15:26.580 --> 02:15:28.780]  And again, we're just all on the outside looking in.
[02:15:29.500 --> 02:15:32.780]  But I know that you're a genuine dude, and I want you to understand
[02:15:32.780 --> 02:15:34.220]  from the backside, it seems like
[02:15:35.580 --> 02:15:38.620]  Mr. King, if you kind of knew his personality.
[02:15:40.660 --> 02:15:42.180]  He's not for the community, man.
[02:15:42.180 --> 02:15:45.620]  So I hope that you see that, especially with the way that you've been
[02:15:45.620 --> 02:15:50.220]  with your seeds and just the way you've given nationally to this group.
[02:15:50.780 --> 02:15:52.940]  You deserve to know that.
[02:15:54.140 --> 02:15:55.900]  So, yeah, that looks like
[02:15:57.100 --> 02:15:59.980]  it as far as just kind of the questions that I had started there,
[02:15:59.980 --> 02:16:01.900]  we kind of addressed a lot of them.
[02:16:03.260 --> 02:16:05.380]  We didn't address this one, though.
[02:16:05.380 --> 02:16:08.860]  The Cowboy Cup buckle, is it really four hundred and twenty thousand dollars?
[02:16:12.420 --> 02:16:14.340]  Is that a question?
[02:16:14.340 --> 02:16:17.260]  You know, see, four hundred and twenty thousand dollars is a
[02:16:18.180 --> 02:16:19.700]  is nothing, right?
[02:16:19.700 --> 02:16:24.220]  I mean, you know, that's a funny joke.
[02:16:25.380 --> 02:16:27.900]  See, those are for sale straight up.
[02:16:27.900 --> 02:16:29.940]  You can ask anyone who's won the buckle.
[02:16:30.260 --> 02:16:31.860]  The buckle is not for sale.
[02:16:31.860 --> 02:16:33.940]  No one's ever given a dollar for a damn buckle.
[02:16:35.500 --> 02:16:37.220]  It'll never happen.
[02:16:37.220 --> 02:16:39.580]  It's never happened and it never will. So.
[02:16:40.860 --> 02:16:42.020]  But we'll get it every year.
[02:16:42.020 --> 02:16:44.900]  I mean, we've done this four years now.
[02:16:44.900 --> 02:16:48.820]  We've gotten we've been accused of selling the buckle for four years now.
[02:16:49.820 --> 02:16:51.140]  It happens.
[02:16:51.220 --> 02:16:55.180]  So moving forward, the more transparent you are, the less that'll go away.
[02:16:55.180 --> 02:16:57.060]  And then again, if people start to see the.
[02:16:58.060 --> 02:17:00.900]  Because, you know, the community again knows who whose stuff
[02:17:01.060 --> 02:17:03.220]  is better than maybe some others.
[02:17:03.220 --> 02:17:06.420]  So if those seem to rise to the top each and every year,
[02:17:07.300 --> 02:17:09.980]  then, you know, the numbers don't lie on that.
[02:17:09.980 --> 02:17:12.580]  And I think when things are done in a correct manner,
[02:17:14.420 --> 02:17:17.700]  the cream does rise to the top.
[02:17:18.300 --> 02:17:20.460]  Should have one of these in Michigan, dude.
[02:17:20.460 --> 02:17:23.500]  Everybody out there so organized. Yeah.
[02:17:24.820 --> 02:17:27.220]  Well, we thought there's something something big for the community,
[02:17:27.220 --> 02:17:29.460]  and we really are trying to do it for our community. So.
[02:17:31.220 --> 02:17:34.420]  You know, I think that's all of the
[02:17:35.220 --> 02:17:38.860]  legit questions right now in chat that we've got going on.
[02:17:38.900 --> 02:17:42.060]  And again, you know, everybody, I encourage you to rewatch this one.
[02:17:42.060 --> 02:17:45.500]  I also encourage you to rewatch the first episode Brian and Marco did
[02:17:45.900 --> 02:17:47.820]  with Brandon Rust and a few of the growers.
[02:17:48.620 --> 02:17:50.820]  Soak it all in. Soak it all in.
[02:17:52.180 --> 02:17:55.500]  I just want to put out that again, this guy, this is for you guys.
[02:17:55.700 --> 02:17:59.900]  The three of us just, you know, took another three hours out of our week
[02:18:00.980 --> 02:18:04.220]  to to, you know, have this interview because these gentlemen
[02:18:04.220 --> 02:18:06.060]  reached out to us as well.
[02:18:06.060 --> 02:18:07.380]  And again, you have to respect that.
[02:18:07.380 --> 02:18:11.300]  So, you know, we have shows today, tomorrow and Thursday.
[02:18:11.580 --> 02:18:14.100]  And I hope that you see it's all, you know,
[02:18:14.260 --> 02:18:16.980]  genuinely just trying to build a community.
[02:18:17.140 --> 02:18:20.580]  And in my opinion, we need the live aspect
[02:18:20.580 --> 02:18:23.340]  just as much as we need the virtual world.
[02:18:23.340 --> 02:18:26.940]  And that's where that that aspect for the small time individual.
[02:18:27.340 --> 02:18:31.100]  You know, even if you're not a home grower, you're still a mom and pop shop.
[02:18:31.300 --> 02:18:33.820]  I mean, in the commercial world, that is a home grower.
[02:18:33.860 --> 02:18:36.340]  I mean, you're competing against deep pockets.
[02:18:36.860 --> 02:18:39.700]  Most most individuals are pretty well funded
[02:18:40.620 --> 02:18:43.460]  when they get into cannabis or they they go to the wayside
[02:18:43.460 --> 02:18:45.940]  because they only had enough to get a year or two.
[02:18:46.420 --> 02:18:48.780]  So there's a lot that goes into this behind the scenes.
[02:18:48.780 --> 02:18:53.580]  And appreciate everybody's time on a Tuesday, you know, taking taking
[02:18:54.700 --> 02:18:57.740]  taking your time to to, I guess, be involved in something
[02:18:57.740 --> 02:19:00.700]  that really isn't necessarily what we should.
[02:19:00.700 --> 02:19:03.580]  But at the same time, this should be the town square.
[02:19:03.580 --> 02:19:05.700]  Peter, Peter has definitely earned that.
[02:19:05.700 --> 02:19:07.580]  And I'm glad that we got to be a part of.
[02:19:10.060 --> 02:19:11.180]  Well, I appreciate you guys.
[02:19:11.180 --> 02:19:13.460]  Thanks again for letting us come on and kind of.
[02:19:14.500 --> 02:19:16.900]  You know, just answering the questions and being, you know,
[02:19:17.180 --> 02:19:20.060]  letting people know how we do things and what our plans are
[02:19:20.060 --> 02:19:22.300]  and all the good things, right?
[02:19:22.300 --> 02:19:26.300]  Yeah, I'm not doing another big one next year and we plan on getting better.
[02:19:27.420 --> 02:19:29.820]  We planned on that before anything ever happened, right?
[02:19:29.820 --> 02:19:33.980]  I mean, the goal is to always improve and get better and do something
[02:19:33.980 --> 02:19:37.860]  that the people here can really attach to and enjoy. So.
[02:19:38.180 --> 02:19:39.180]  Right on, everybody.
[02:19:39.180 --> 02:19:42.180]  Marco, any closing words or thoughts there?
[02:19:43.940 --> 02:19:44.940]  See frozen.
[02:19:49.080 --> 02:19:50.320]  Oh, he's peace out.
[02:19:50.320 --> 02:19:52.320]  He's got shit to say, homie.
[02:19:52.760 --> 02:19:54.160]  Yeah, I'm with you.
[02:19:54.160 --> 02:19:57.160]  I'm at. Thank you, everybody, for your time.
[02:19:57.160 --> 02:19:58.960]  I appreciate it.
[02:19:58.960 --> 02:20:00.160]  You guys have a good day.
[02:20:00.160 --> 02:20:01.160]  You too.
