I got these United heads with my hoes, you know.
Got it.
Alright.
What's your dealer?
Yeah.
Alright, so grab some dubs and I'm good to go.
So just yell at me, yeah?
Alright.
Alright, audio.
Give me one second.
Mute.
Oh wait, sorry. Yeah.
Alright, back over here.
Alright, let's see if the YouTube world can hear us.
Can you hear us now?
Whoop.
Alright.
Cool.
So...
After last week's intense conversation, I thought it'd be nice to have like a nice, uh...
easygoing, uh...
just talk about what you've been doing this season and, uh...
kind of a run through the projects and then kind of a look ahead to next year, so...
Anyone want to, uh...
want to start it up?
And actually while we're doing this, I'm going to be doing some data entry.
I'm going to be putting some of the new Boneyard gear up on the website, so, uh...
Yes, sir. I'm about to be sending in some, uh...
a few new ones here to you guys.
Both you and Seeds here now will be getting some of the new drops.
Excellent.
I sent some pictures to you on that, uh...
if you'd like to drop some on the...
on the, uh...
YouTube.
For the next year, so...
Anyone want to, uh...
want to start it up?
Oh, that's weird. Oh yeah, you've got to mute the YouTube.
Yeah. I had to pause it. There we go. Sorry about that.
Yeah, um...
So I'm going to be sending in some, uh...
Government Cheese, the Kory's Crush,
the Ghost of Mary Jane.
All those will all be going in there.
Some more Haze for Days are going in, because everybody's been asking me to send those in again.
Haze is going crazy this year.
Indeed.
Let's see here.
Trying to get the comments to pop up here for me.
How's everybody else doing out there today?
Tyler, Trevor...
I'm doing good, man. I'm doing good.
I was just packing my bowl. I couldn't get to the mute button there.
I'm sorry.
Um...
I'm doing good, man. I'm doing lots of cool stuff.
I've been putting, uh...
a bunch of the Kandahar, the Murph Red,
uh...
Pure Afghani P1 stock to the test.
So I've been...
I got a...
I got three or four mails that I pulled out of the...
the two packs that I got.
And, um... yeah.
That's what I'm doing, man.
I've been playing with that. I'm super excited.
I got a whole plethora.
It's gonna hit the whole stable, you know.
Inbreds and not.
And, you know, funny clones.
So all the PAM stuff's gonna get...
gonna get tangled up with it.
It's gonna get tangled up with itself
for preservation, and then it's gonna...
you know, it's gonna hit all the elites.
Like the Royal, the SFVs,
the MAC,
you know, all the classics.
And then I'm gonna work a couple of those
together and see what we got.
But I'm looking for, uh...
you know, those...
those rancid,
oily, dead body, meat
turps that, uh...
you know. I wanna open up a bag
like the old days
and have everybody in the entire
hundred thousand plus stadium
go, holy shit, trimbles here, you know.
So, um... that's the way it goes.
That's funny.
Uh, well, why not...
Tony, you wanna... you wanna walk through
kinda what you worked on this season?
And you gotta unmute yourself.
Yeah, um...
what I'm working on this whole year,
and actually the last two years,
has been some crosses to my
Space Cheese male.
He's a male that...
And can you talk more into the mic?
Okay.
So, um...
Nope.
Go for it.
There we go.
That should be better.
Yeah.
This is to my Space Cheese male.
He is a cross of a...
Cross to my
Angel male that Blue Cheese
was created locally
by a...
who come to the collective that I used to work at
here in Northern California.
When he moved out of the state,
he never came back to collect his clone,
and I ended up... breeding projects.
I created her back in 08.
I've been running her for a few years
until just...
Recently,
I started whipping her back out to breed with her.
And I used the two females
and one male, along with a...
clones in my collection,
like the Triangle Cush,
the Ghost OG, Cherry Pie,
Dog Walker,
the Dog...
Excuse me.
Dog Walker,
Fire OG,
Pure Cush.
I hit her up to a bunch of different plants
over the last two years,
and have been running her through testing to see how they go.
There's also the Bruce Banner
Cheddar Bob just popped up here in the
comments on YouTube.
That's the Bruce Banner to Space Cheese.
I did a lot of crosses with that plant.
That plant brings
color. It has
a funky cheese background on it,
and berries,
fermented berries I've come across on the backside.
We've been finding
quite a few bubblegum phenos
on a lot of these crosses that are
leaning real hard to the Space Cheese side.
We found one in the GMO,
I found one in the Ghost OG,
I found one in the Topanga crosses,
and I found two in the back crosses to Space Cheese
that I did.
So, yeah, I've been doing
crosses with that plant this year.
I've got
10 crosses already fully tested out.
I've got another 7 going out next
week and this week to a bunch of new
testers. I'll also be
looking for a few more testers I need to find
because I'm going to send some crosses out to multiple
different growers so that I can get it tested
in different locations.
You're finding a lot of similarities
in the different crosses
because of the Space Cheese male.
Do you find things that are always there no matter what
or not there no matter what?
Something like that?
Yeah, that plant will always shorten
the flower time to its crosses unless you're
working with something like a 50 day strain
if you have one. But everything I've ever hit
it to, she knocks a good week off
of a flower easily.
He,
the male, the Mr. Firmanda, he also will bring
density to the cross
and like I said, if your line is carrying
a recessive purple gene, he's also carrying
a recessive purple which means you will find
some purple phenotypes and genotypes
in the line.
The test grow
that Anthro sent to me I did,
he found a beautiful
purple specimen that's leaning
extremely hard to the
angel side
and the cookie side.
So a bunch of the grandparents'
traits are popping up in the
F1 cross of these two here,
this hybrid. So yeah,
those always show up there. Like I said, you'll get that
fermented cheese,
back note from the UK cheese,
grandmother also,
that plant breathes
purple
on that funky side.
I know that
Lucas here, Collectic Elegance, he's actually
sampled some of the space cheese line
when I was with him at the Emerald Cup.
I could let him tell you pretty much
how the flavor of that plant comes across.
Nobody believes it's just me trying to hype up my line.
And when Lucas gets back
in the cell phone reception, he will
respond to that comment.
Yeah, he's been asking me
for a cut of that since he's tasted.
He'll be, the
only other person, I gave one cut to my partner
in Michigan, he runs
it in his grow there,
and I'm going to pass one over to Lucas, because
he's wanted to have that in his
arsenal for either
personal stash, breeding, or whatever
he'd like to do with it.
It's definitely
a special
cultivar that you created there,
brother. That one
kind of dumbfounded me when you
allowed me to smell it.
And then we got to smoke it, it was even
better. But yeah, it's like
the most
aged, funky,
crazy cheese that you could
ever think of. I don't know,
like, I'm not a cheese person,
but I would imagine
there's some pretty
gnarly cheeses
out there, but it just smells like
something that had been aged
for a very
long time, and it was, it's almost
kind of indescribable.
It's just very complex,
but it was,
it had my taste buds
just on a next level.
That one, yeah,
that one I thought was extremely special,
because I've grown out multiple
supposed cheese crosses,
this, that, and the other, not
really getting that profile, and
then once Tony
had that, I was like, oh, okay,
I see what
people mean by, you know,
having a great cheese strain.
And yeah, that
I've been wanting to smoke her again
ever since I did
at Emerald Cub.
Yeah, she's
a fermented parmesan
cheese, like just
old crusty feet with a
fermented berry. She has a lot of
traits from the angel and space
coast side, because of that
blueberry influence.
The blueberry seems to not ever pop
out in the bring, I still have not found
any phenotypes that are just pure
blueberry at all. The flavors
that come off her are always more of a
fermented berry type when they do pop
up. Cheddar Bob found that in his
Bob's Cheddar when he ran
the test grow. He ran
the
Bruce Banner number three mother
alongside the test line
that I sent to him.
He found berry kicks
and fermented cheese, again,
on the back side of that one also.
And then there's also that diesel influence
from the Bruce Banner number three.
I also had
Jen's Garden. She ran my
Ghost of Mary Jane,
the Ghost OG, cross to space cheese.
She ran six phenos
of it in her room. She did a
killer job. She found all kinds of killer
stuff popping out of there. There's some pure
Ghost OG looking phenos, all the way
over to the ones that will show the color
through the space cheese side
with more density.
Like those plants will have
way more weight compared to
the OG influence from the
Ghost OG when they're leaning harder to the space
cheese.
That line doesn't look like it may be
putting on the weight because it isn't the biggest
plant in your room, but then when you go to
weigh that stuff, cheese always
puts on weight.
Cheddar could tell you about that.
That plant,
you could throw the buds at your buddy and knock them out
with them nugs.
I love stuff like that, man. Bag
traveler.
The hardest one I have is my
bum bud. If anyone wants to go check out
Nugs, go on
YouTube and look up the tire test.
You should
find my bum
bud on there. I run over the
bud with my van
to see if I could crush the bud.
I can't crush the bud with a van.
That all comes through my
angel influence, which is
the father line to the space
cheese that I'm using, that I've created.
You got to repost that one, man.
That's killing.
Hell yeah.
I'm waiting on a bunch of the
pure kush reversal
beans to finish up,
man.
I'm excited.
Going to have some fems out there to look through.
Kev's pure kush is
a killer plant.
I'm excited
to play around with what's
inside there.
I've seen you doing that, man. I've got that same
pure kush that you have, and that plant's killer, man.
I'm intrigued
with what you're doing with her and what you cross her
to for sure, man. I crossed her to my
angel and to the space
cheese this year, so I have a
few crosses of it to her.
She's a killer plant for
all kinds of nerve issues
and anything
on the medicinal side leaning that way.
That plant is awesome.
Kevin picked the winner right there.
I'm excited
for these F3s.
Lucas, you're glitching out a little bit.
Alright, maybe I'll wait.
No, no, no. Actually, that was better right there.
Okay.
See, I got those
black lime
reserve F3s about to happen.
I got some
lime breath
reserve F2s
with my keeper
lime skunk
cut.
Those are about to get chopped in a few weeks.
I recently got OG kush breath
from a good
buddy, and I
have a really good
meat breath F2
that is very
OG KB leaning.
He looks
identical to the clones that came.
It was great.
I'll be working
an OG KB
IBL, so I'll be taking it
hopefully down a few
lines and really get OG kush breath
into a stable seed form and
hopefully maybe
reinvigorate her
a little bit since she's a very
slow growing plant.
Definitely, I'm playing with
some OGs and fuels that
I'm working with.
I think we lost him.
Fell out there.
I have some of those black lime reserve
F2s that he made that he's talking about
that he used a continuation into the F3s.
They're nice. I ran them outside here.
They're killer stuff. I was with him when he
bought the packs from MeanGene
at the Emerald Cup when he got that one.
That line's beautiful for breeding.
Yeah, can you, I mean
that's had such an influence on
so many people's breeding projects.
Can you talk about it a little bit?
Well, it's just a killer line.
Gene's lime clone that he used to put into
that line, it just pops off with that
brightness. If you dig through that
seed line, you will find those
lime terpene profiles that are
just all day smoke.
That's the stuff you can smoke all damn day.
It tastes so good in your mouth.
It's uplifting and energetic.
Great for PTSD.
It's a killer plant.
I've used some of that
Black Lime Reserve
in a few crosses that I keep for myself.
I've never released.
I have some from Riley. I have some
from a couple other
farmers that have done continuations on that also.
It's just when Gene
popped that off, when they let him go
out at
the Emerald Cup, everybody was there.
It was crazy how many people showed up
to get in on that stuff. Gene's just got
the palate
and the talent and the arsenal
to whip out
world-class cannabis. We all want to do
that stuff, but if you don't have all of that
stuff, it's like trying to pick that one
winner strain that's got
trichome density. It's got
color. It's got flavor.
That's Gene.
Gene's got that ability because of
his connections to the
history of the plant and the areas from.
He can select from different lines
that most of us just don't have the ability to.
That's why
I believe so many people are drawn
to the work that he does.
The history that he's seen
and the hills that he's at
is just unparalleled
with a lot of breeders that are out there.
Many people don't
want to put themselves out
like Gene's done, or
they don't have the ability to
produce the plants on the scale
that he's done, or
it's just his mentality also.
There's a lot of things that come through with Gene
that attracts people to that
breeding and his seeds
and his style of just
doing shit, man. Me and Lucas,
we went to the Cub together. It was me,
him, and Levi, and our buddy Rain Man,
and Lucas's parents.
We all rented a house, and we were
partying up. Part of that
was hitting up Gene's booth. I wanted
to get there to get some herb and to pick up some gear
from him to support them, but
we all just went there to hook up. We used to do that
all the time, me and Levi and Lucas.
It was just something that we used to do, man.
I miss those days. We used to hit the Cubs up
and just
make the best of times
of that shit, man. It was the greatest. It was the only time
I ever used to leave my garden also when I went to the
Emerald Cub. Until...
I think for a lot of people it was like that.
Yeah, until 2012, I had never
left my garden. I went to a
High Times Cub because I was
mentoring this kid, and he'd
never seen anything about legal cannabis, so I took him
and his fiancé to the Cub to show him what it was
all about.
That was the first time I ever left my damn
garden. In 2012,
I went again
to another High Times Cub,
to an Emerald Cub. Then I went to the
2014. It's like the only time I ever
leave is go to those Cubs.
It's difficult when you're
really trying to keep shit going.
Leaving for three days is
pretty hard. It's hard to automate
a huge system like that when
it wasn't already done.
I had multiple rooms I was taking care of.
I was
busting my ass on the clone side of things.
I had so many clones
going, there was no way I could leave.
I pretty much had to plan for six months
ahead of time just to be able to go to those Emerald Cubs.
Did you go to any
of the ones on the
Area 101?
Not in the old days, I did not, man.
In the older
days where I came from, we didn't talk about weed.
I didn't start fucking with weed until
they made it legal in my town because
I didn't want to go to jail. I'd already been
busted twice for cannabis.
I didn't make a thing of
trying to be public with herb until
2008.
That was the first time that I
went in a collective. They started
asking questions to the bud tenders
and those guys just stared at everybody like,
what the fuck you talking about?
We got four kinds of weed, that's it.
You're asking too many questions. I started answering questions
to the patients in front of me.
The owner comes up and he's like, hey, dude,
you want a job? That's how I ended up
getting a job with cannabis. Because it was
legal, I figured I didn't have to risk
going to jail again. I went and got
FBI background checks at the
clubs and the city quit fucking
with me. That's when I just went
hardcore into going completely
public with everything I did from breeding
to teaching people shit.
Before that, it was always the
backside. I was the dude that nobody saw.
I was the guy that was supplying seeds.
I brought fucking clones. I was setting up gardens.
I didn't want nobody to know who the fuck I was
because my family had been in jail
for this plant.
I didn't want to risk a third time.
That shit right there is not...
Yeah, that's no joke.
It's not copacetic, man.
We get all these people
today angry and bitching about bands
on fucking Instagram.
I was looking at years in prison for growing
12 plants for my family.
First two times was for my grandfather.
That's what brought me into breeding to start with.
I didn't want to try to push no third time
until shit went legal here.
I knew they weren't going to be flying...
They used to fly choppers right over my house.
Literally, we were trying to land on my garages
and shit after we got busted.
They did that for six years.
Every year, they'd fly right up on top of my house.
They would do that multiple times
through the season.
I ain't trying to go to jail, dude.
You're crazy.
They did that for half a decade
and then finally stopped.
They quit coming directly over my house
but they still fly my area.
There's a cat right up the road
that has a helipad that he's putting on his property
that he lets the federal forest service
show up there so they can bring
an officer with them and fly over.
If he spots anything, it's automatic.
He can go bust your ass right there.
The bad days.
The very bad days.
I'm glad that you're still doing the awesome work, man.
Pretty cool stuff
seeing that Cheese is still around.
Yeah, man.
That line's killer.
I'm working on getting a cut of her back also.
The original Luton Exodus UK Cheese.
The original cut.
My buddy's trying to pick her up
at the moment. He's off to send it to me.
I'll see. I might get her back.
I can send it to you, Tony.
Sorry, I just got home.
We had a chance to go to
a company called
Ultem Electroleaf
which is one of the cookies growers
here in Oklahoma.
They have a
facility that is
completely bootstrapped.
Started with
small lighted
and have expanded into a
20,000 square foot facility.
I was pretty excited to see
the stuff that they were running in there.
I was actually really disappointed
with some of the stuff that they were running.
Everything
was nothing more than just
standard production stuff. Nothing
that had a really distinct
profile that would really
stand out. I don't remember any
of the cultivars except for one being
a pink runce
that was in their genetic portfolio.
It's really interesting
that you bring up the
UK cheese
and having that because I know
that obviously we talk
to each other but we only talk to each other
on this kind of a platform for the whole.
I know that
this last year I bred
quite a bit with my
UK cheese female.
That's the Exodus cut as well.
I crossed that to my OG Kush
male and then I
also crossed it to
a couple of other things that didn't really pan out.
I only ended up keeping the cheese cross.
Besides that I also
have my Terp Isle No. 4
which is my
Jamaican Heirloom
times a pure Kush which
I just used the pure Kush to be able to bring down
some of the flowering
time of the Jamaican Heirloom just because
it was about a 12 week cultivar on its own.
At least that's what that was selected for.
Then also we have
another one called Odonata
which is Santa Maria
times top 44
and I received that one
in a
cross and I used
her to cross
to a cantaloupe
haze from DNA Genetics
that I found to be
a nice haze
interpretation in my mind.
I used that one and that one
has turned out to being a good washing
product. Obviously since
the market does like purple
cannabis I also crossed that
to a grape ape
so I had my
grape ape Odonata
but I just called it
Grape Odonata. Then the last
one that I did this season was
actually I have two
the first one being
my black bubble which was the
98 pre-bubble Kush
crossed to the Vietnamese black
and then I also have
a blueberry Kush which was
just blueberry crossed
to OG Kush
and that was just another one of the crosses
that I made whenever
I was using that same male.
It's interesting
that some of these lines kind of get
worked in different spots but at the same
time completely
different
but at the same time I think that it just goes to show
maybe the
taste for the time frame that we've
been in the cannabis space
maybe. I don't know what your guys
thoughts are in regards to that.
Yeah I feel like you know
the strains change from region
even. What's popular in one area may not
be popular in another area. What sells
one area may not sell in another.
I was really curious about what you found in that
cantaloupe haze from DNA.
I ran out a pack of those. I was
definitely not stoked on what I found.
What stood out with
the cantaloupe?
It was structured body.
The frame
was pretty much what I was
going for along with
trying to add a little bit of
resin and
numerics on the THC
side a little bit
just to make it commercially viable.
But I
didn't think that it was the best
representation I've ever seen
of a haze but as far as
having an accessible
mail where I can actually work
stuff it was good enough to
kind of make the cut.
But I have seen
better. I've worked better.
It's just what I had
access to but ultimately
if I can get something that I can cut down
the flower time
with some of these other
cultivars that aren't necessarily
hip anymore. I don't
know very many people that are
running stuff like a Santa Maria
top 44 cross
inside the U.S.
at least.
I could be completely wrong
in regards to that.
Has anyone worked any of those lines?
The cantaloupe haze I used
that back in 2003 when they were
still offered as regulars.
That's what I was going to ask you guys.
Which generation did yours come from?
Are they Femmes or did you guys have
options to use the regulars?
The only DNA stuff I ever bred
was regular. Once I dove into
their Femmes I found they weren't
representing the same as the regulars
for me. I'm not sure
what changed in them.
I've ran the cantaloupe haze
twice from regular and Femmes.
I've ran the cataract cush from them.
The LA confidential in both ways.
I like the regular stuff
that I did with the cantaloupe
haze. I used it in
2003 and 2004 and 2005.
Up until 2008 I was
using that in different crosses
with my car wreck, my razor's edge.
I did some crosses with
the Romulan, my grape wreck.
I did a cross with the
lavender.
I did a cross with kryptonite.
OG.
Yeah, I ran that.
It wasn't bad for me.
It doesn't
I'm not sure what the crosses they have
on the cantaloupe haze completely.
It doesn't represent as a haze
like my haze does. It's way
denser and finishes much quicker.
But it does retain some of that profile
of the haze on there.
We used to call it carnage because
we got her with the seed stock
that we purchased in
Amsterdam when they opened their store.
They gave away
1,000 packs of that for free
before they gave it the name
cantaloupe haze. We got our seed stock
Yeah, they gave it to us prior
to giving it the name.
That's what I ran.
So if you got it then too, then you would have had
regular seeds. It would have been
before 2005 or 2006
because after that's when they
went to complete
feminization of all their lines.
Yeah, the only thing
that I run from DNA
is I have their
tangy, I have
their cantaloupe
haze. And then I want to
say that I also have their LA
Confidential
that's all in regular seed form.
I don't work anything
that is feminized still.
I'm still trying to
kind of get over all of that.
But for me, as far as all my seed stock,
it's all regular format.
The LA Confidential and regular is what they
used for a basis of a lot of their breeding
back in the day. So if you have that in regular,
that one's killer to dive into.
I ran a ton of their stuff with the regular form
back in the day. And I ended up with
cantaloupe haze and cataract cush in the majority
of what I was using to breed
with along with the LA Confidential
and a few.
That was in the early days of
doing breeding.
That was when I still had a company called
215 Farms before it was Boneyard Seeds.
That was also an edible company, a clone
company.
The seeds I ran were regular
because we only had four females.
They were nice.
It was in the Pacific Northwest, so they were nice
because they got to finish at least for a haze.
But we were running them next to
some plants that were Durban Chocolopes.
And those were screaming loud.
Way louder hazy.
Just loud compared to the
cantaloupe hazes.
So it was just, you know.
I haven't found for sure.
In some forums, they say that that
cantaloupe haze may even be a Cindy 99
that was passed to them that they called a cantaloupe haze.
So that may be the reason why it finishes
quicker and has that density to it.
I think there's Cambodia
in the cantaloupe.
But I could be wrong.
I could just be out of luck.
I don't know. I haven't been able to get 100%
on the complete.
There's so many people saying different things on that.
But it worked
good in breeding for me.
I used it to test out the females I was doing.
I used the Cataract and the
LA and the Cantaloupe to test across
two different females to see which ones were going to pair well
for me and give me some of the results I had.
That's why I ended up with
going to the Cataract Kush
to put into the Romulan instead of the Cantaloupe Haze
or the LA Confidential.
It gave me the medicinal effect I was after.
And that's why I ended up
just letting those fall away
and just sticking with that Cataract Kush
cross to the Romulan for my Angel Male
Space Kush side of everything.
That's dope.
That's cool with these Breeder Roundtables.
I didn't find anything too
impressive in that Cantaloupe, but you and Chase
found something good enough to at least
continue on. I think that's what's cool with
seed packs and even better with the community
that we have today. We can
reach out and be like, hey, I didn't find anything
cool in this. Did you find anything cool? Oh yeah.
Let me get a cut. Let me see. Let me rerun that.
I think it's really cool to be able to do that.
That's a good thing about it
also, though.
I'll let you ask your question first.
Thank you, Chase. I was just curious,
Mr. Trees, I actually picked up a bunch of those
Kandahar Afghani land races
from Irzing with the tour book.
I was
really excited to start running
them just to see what's up, but I'm kind of holding back
just kind of seeing. I know Kevin ran out
some of the Gosney. You said you're
running out some of the Kandahar Black
and the Moray Red. What do you find
in there? I'm really curious. Is it as
enticing as Irzing makes it
sound, like straight gas-dead animals
like female? What do you find in there? I'm curious.
So, right now
I've got the Red going
and I finally got
out of the
little bit that I had
I found
two nice
females that I would
consider
worthy of modern day standards
in a lot of ways.
But
the males that I found
were the coolest because
all of them have this really
acrid,
funky,
robust
smell
just exuding out of them
from veg
on and every time you would pull off a leaf
or rub them
or move them around in any way
it would immediately fill the air
and it just reminded me so much of
the old stuff that I grew up growing
and burning
and playing with when I was
much younger.
Just looking at them, they look tough
the
durability factor for the
cold spells that they went through
and the way that they stood and the story
all behind them all was just really
awesome. But I've always been looking for those
nasty, acrid
skunk tones.
The roadkill-esque
or something near it and I believe
that that's
it came from somewhere over there
and we gotta, if we wanna find it
we gotta find where it came from
originally. So I've been growing lots of
different Afghanis and lots of different Pakistanis
and funky things like
that but I believe that
there is some nasty
stuff that's
coming out but I haven't got to
enjoy any of it yet. I'm about
midway through
flowering out those males now
I'm gonna take them all the way and see what happens
My buddy and I
split up a bunch of, you know, a tray of clones
of them and he's doing some outdoors
and I've got some going inside
and we're gonna see
what we got going on, you know, see what they do
If there's anything funky that happens
in either place
that'll get cold out of there
but as of now, there's not
too many to deal with but there's
four males and two
females and, you know, split up
into two groups
so yeah, they're, you know
I'm really excited
I'm gonna go through it
I'm gonna grow it multiple ways and
how it kinda goes back to your other thing
where you guys were talking about didn't find a keeper
or didn't find anything in a
pack of seeds and, you know, that
can happen but I really find
that if I can grow them
at least twice
either two times
directly or, you know
grow them in a different way or at least
try to go through a pack and grow everything
kinda twice, then I really
kinda know if there's nothing
worthwhile because there's been a couple of plants
that, you know,
I grew one time and I would've thrown them away
and just by accident I grew them
again and they turned out outstanding
something completely different from the
first time around, the first expression
so this is the first time
running through these
I'm definitely excited still
but I don't
have any, you know, definitive
information, I gotta grow them twice to know
for sure and we gotta finish out
the first time so
yeah, I'm stoked but I'm gonna
hit them to everything that I have
and I'm gonna preserve them as much as I can
and try to
go through the population
this first time is just for, you know, fun
and preservation
but I'm definitely
I'm excited to watch
and I'm excited to see what you do
with it, curious what the trike
heads look like
were they kinda bulbous hash tricomb
heads or what were we looking at
trike wise
very
you know, it's early
it's, you know, it's
week three, week two and a half
week three, but there's definitely
a sandy tricomb
texture to what I got working on
not really tall
heads, they're really kinda tight to the plant
and more bulbous
but
it's early, like I said, it's early
so I'm excited, I think
that, you know, they're gonna be
one of those more sandy
texture, kinda tough
on the exterior and
I'm hoping that they kinda
you know, they shake free easy
but I really don't care
my whole point is the
is the acrid, nasty
you know, smells
I'm looking for something
funkadelic that's gonna light up
the whole space, you know what I mean
yeah man
you and me both
so do you plan to open populate
those to try to find a larger
gene pool to sift out of to see if
what, cause
let's say you have twenty seeds right
and those twenty seeds aren't showing you
what you're looking for directly
right now, like you said, you grow them in another one
and they come out a little better but even if they're
still not showing what you're looking
for, it could be highly recessive
in the gene pool, you open
pollinate all the boys and
girls together, the next thing you know, the F2
starts showing what you were looking for
that's why
never judge a line on the ten seeds you
purchased, like if you're really
about trying to figure out if that line's gonna
work for you or what you're after
open pollinate them
dig into the F2s and find what you're looking
for, cause it's energetic
you know, that's the problem
with where we're at, everybody keeps taking a smaller
and smaller portion of the seed stock
and line breeding two plants into a new
direction and believing they've retained
some of the gene pool that came from a
grandparent or great-grandparent and all
we're doing is removing those by
not having recombined
alleles in there
so the more and more folks do this
and continue to say the breeder
didn't stabilize nothing or
it's not what I found or wanted in there
without trying to dig into that line
for real, it's just
like a fool's errand, that's like biting one
tomato off of a plant and
that one didn't taste good, it was also
green and wasn't ripe, you didn't try a red
one and you're judging all
tomatoes based on that one flavor
100%
yeah, no, that was
the purpose of the project was to do an
open pollination cause I had so few
and I wanted to get them all out
and breed them all so that
we had the population go through and look
at everything intricately
over years, I really wanted to preserve
it and do it the right way
as best as I could
so, but like
Ryan Lee always says, if you've got pollen
flying, you might as well
put some other stuff in there too
so we got
that project set up
ready to go, everything is
pollens about ready to be flying
and
yeah, there's some other things
in there too that'll catch
and make that, you know, make those
funny fun crosses and then
we'll look at the actual
label them out, make sure every plant
knows, I'm keeping the males
I'm gonna keep them all
use them in the future
or not use them in the future but I'm gonna keep
keeping all the males and keeping all the females
I'm just gonna
preserve it as best as I can
I'm gonna reverse the males
to get more seed stock on that side
in a pure form
I'm gonna, you know, probably reverse
the females but really I want to reverse
the males and
you know, breed them and I really want to get
as much of that genetic
as I can and as many seed
as I can so that I can have them and
play around with those, you know
but yeah, you gotta hit
some of those other ladies
like, you know, the Royal Kush or
you know, the ice cream cake, the Pam
you gotta hit that stuff with that first P1
just for fun and then kind of
you'll have something else to play with, throw in the fridge
you know, so
but yeah, definitely.
So will you keep those males if you find
males in the F2 that are
better to you?
I might
yeah, I mean
these males still gotta go through a few things
I wanna put them outside in the cold
really get them tested, see if they
frost up, what they do
in different kind of situations, I just wanna play around
with these ones for a little while
if the progeny that
they, you know
throw out turns out to be really
really cool or interesting
then I'll keep them around a little longer
if I find something
cooler in the next realm
yeah, it's just, you know, it's
space is always the thing, you know, you gotta
be cool, you gotta be, you know, you gotta be
you know, you gotta be worth your stay
so if something really comes out crazy
and I wanna start spending some
money, I'll test the males, I'll test them
for some cannabinoids, I'll test them for
you know, some terpenes from whatever I can get
like I said, I'll do
some reversing on them as well, I'll do funny things
but yeah, you know, you gotta
move the genes forward, so I always
always find new ones
and, you know, pick the ones
that I like out of it all, but
this first stock, this is the
this is the stock pure straight from
straight from there, you know, so I don't
wanna just throw it away, you know, as quick
as, you know, I can
I wanna really just make sure I make the right
right choices with the little stuff
I have
you might find something killer in the Cib Crosses
or in the F2
genes back to the
to the, basically
the ants or the...
Tony, right into that mic
you'll find some cool stuff in the
Cib Crosses out of those for sure
and the F2 Generations back
crossed into the parent lines
what about the
the red
stood out to you that you chose
other than the black, cause I know
you said you had the Kandahar black as well
the
the red from
from the reading
was more the foul
foul terp, you know, profile
they were more on the foul side
I think the
the green had a lot of the fuel
terps and other things like that
you know, some
of those types of tones
the black was
also kinda
kinda in that realm, but something about that
red, the way that that plant, when I saw a couple
of those pictures and the way that that
red was standing
that just, it reminded me the
the nub formation of them
I can kinda pull it up and check it out
go to Eurazan's
site and look for the
Kandahar red or the Murph red
but yeah, they just stood with this
killer, killer
like, chunky
nub structure and the
red fade
leaves, but the cold
tolerance, cause it went through one of the
coldest parts of the
coldest, you know, snaps
or one of the coldest
in history or something like that
and a lot of those plants were still left standing
strong, but yeah
I like the morphological characteristics cause I really
wanted those awful
awful terps
I didn't want the fuel per se
I wanted the
skunks and the acrid and the
the rotten
you know, something like that
the death, heck yeah man
sounds like I should get you some of my
Lamb Breath Reserve to play with
I'm finding a lot of that in
my LBR
what are you guys
using for note
taking capabilities? Are you guys
journaling or do you guys
have some other
format that you're using to be able
to input data? I know for years
and years and years I had to literally
throw all that information away at the end
of a run to be able to avoid
having
a enhancement if I had any type
of charge, but now being able to keep all
this information and just labeling
stuff properly
for long term
purposes is also another thing because
I don't know if you guys are guilty of this as
well, but I'm very guilty of
back in the day taking a sharpie to
a sandwich baggie
and then it getting rubbed off
and then going with like a piece of
scotch tape
or duct tape and putting it on
a sandwich baggie even just to be able
to have some type of a label system
but just curious
what you guys use for that
I have a
journal
I do
double
titles
so I'll like write it in a piece of paper
in a baggie with the seeds
and then I'll also write what it is
on the baggie
I got a crazy memory
and I remember
crazy things that I shouldn't
you know, including fruit trees
and other stuff, but when I write things
down for labels like plants, clones
seeds, stuff like that
they all have their own little note card
and on the note card I always
write what it is
you know, proper
parental lineup
and then notes about the plant itself
like plant number
what its features
were, short, tall
you know, smelled like this
smelled like that and I'll put as much on
this little card as I can and that goes inside
the bag
so it doesn't go inside
the bag with the seeds but it goes inside
you know, the second bag that the seeds go in
so you got a little
card on there and then I write on the bag
just in case but yeah
that rubs off
but I just take
extra care in
labeling and making sure there's
as much data on the label
as I can and then when I go
through it I have like this photographic memory
I never forget a tree, I never forget a
plant, I never forget anything like that
it's really weird
I have this photographic memory as soon as I see it
I'm like oh it was that plant, boom I remember that
that's exactly right, boom and I just
know, but yeah
a little card with the stuff
That's super
impressive just because I know
that I see such a high population of
different varietals that it's like
I just kind of almost get lost
in a lot
of stuff as far as names, I just kind of
go back to looking at the
parental stock or the building block stock
does that look like it's Cush dominant
does that look like
that's got OG dominant characteristics
and stuff of that nature
just trying to find stuff that
you can kind of
take genetics and
put them into little categories
to be able to put them in your building blocks
and I know that
I try to hit all of the
major terpene profiles
when setting up
a row and
what I personally like, but at the same
time I know that
I don't always enjoy just immersing
dominant
varietal which that's the most prominent
cultivar, or not cultivar but terpene
so
I don't know if
you guys are very similar
to myself or no matter how
happy I am with what I'm doing
that someone will bring something
around and I'm like oh my goodness what is that
just because it's different than what I
have, it makes it
interesting
and unfortunately
I can say that I'm guilty of that
happening to me multiple times
in the cannabis world
I definitely
felt like that when Tony
showed me that cheese, I was like whoa
I've literally never
hey I was still
young and I don't necessarily have
smoked
as much as say
Tony over, he smoked
decades past what I have but
once he showed me that
I was like wow, I've never smoked
anything that had such a cheesy
profile or even smelled
cannabis that smelled
like cheese so that was definitely
one for me that kind of
blew me away just with the
potential this plant has
I would say the last time I felt
like that was when I came across the
herb me and Lucas smoked at the
Emerald Cup when we got it from
Gene, the oil spill that he had
we got some hash and
some buds from it, that oil spill reminds
me of a plant from the 80s
that we used to have before we got
busted, as soon as that thing showed
up, when I tasted that stuff
I was, all I could think
about was how the fuck did
Gene end up with a plant or a profile
that I had so long ago
I've never seen since and I've ran
thousands of cultivars from seeds
I've ran thousands of
seeds from those cultivars, like I've
ran plants, the numbers I've
seen is crazy and I've never
seen that profile pop up in another line
until I ran into that stuff with Gene
I was just instantly enthralled
with it, it was killer
Trevor, I'm
staring at some oil spill
88G13 crosses
so you have some experience with that as well
right?
Yeah
we got a pack of the oil spill when
they were first dropped
a aficionado dropped them
I think it was in like 2016
or 17
and it's a
stout, just ridiculously
frosty plant
it's a lot like
they're all very similar
and by all I mean
the Royal Kush family
so it's got that Royal Kush
with I think it's
XXXOG
was the
the
outcross
or the hybrid
it's just a super
super stout, incredibly
frosty Royal Kush
type plant
it produces
that sort of
great
purple kush, like classic
humble purple
kush sort of turf profile
that the Royal's got, it's got something
a little extra on top of it
but it's like, the thing that it
reminds me of the most is that old
purple kush
and so it's got that turf profile
but it's got a different
bud aesthetic
where the Royal and the purple
are much more of a purple nub
the oil spill's
got much more of a white
sort of the trichome
coverage is just so intense that
it's got much more of a white color
and a lot of the color
in terms of the purpling is
concentrated more out on the leaves
and they get incredibly dark, almost black
and so it has
really nice contrast of
these super super dark
leaves with this incredibly
just trichome
laden frosty white nub
and
it's a little more fuel-y
with that classic purple kush
sort of turf
and in the 88
with the 88 hybrids
it really blows up the nub structure
the nub structure on the oil
spill was much smaller
you get massive
nubs from the 88
and so that's one
of the main things that it does is it changes
the structure of it and you'll also get
much more of a green phenotype
at least in the outdoors from what I've seen
so that's
the oil spill 88 cross
and my experience with it both
in
the selection that was
made from the pack that
we got years ago
and also it's out cross
with the 88
yeah when I talked to Gene about
that oil spill he says that the side
that he prefers
is that oil can side where the power comes
from he talks about that on one
of the future cannabis projects he's
been on now that line just will lay
you out
wish you weren't smoking as
much weed as you just smoked
wish you couldn't stop
the weeds
old school herb
it's the finest
I have a question Trevor brought up
made me think
Hindu Kush why do people
dog on Jager so much
and
for me I didn't think that that was
that bad of a
of a cultivar I thought it was
very pronounced distinct
and unique but I know that it
is a lot of
bad publicity kind of like the
fuck blue dream stuff
I think that's
exactly it it's kind of the blue dream
of Oregon so
it's a
commercial producer it has
the hardiness to withstand
the moisture
up there and people produce large
quantities of it and have for years
so it just kind of became the
the
stereotypical outdoor
Oregon
herb and there's
you know it's got a unique
turf profile it's not bad
I know people who have done
great work with it
Bradley Danks on Instagram
is somebody who's worked with the
Jager and done incredible
work he's definitely somebody
to check out he's just
a small individual
breeder who's been working
with his plants for years
staying in his own lane
doing a back cross project with
the Jager he calls it the
Jager Schnitzel and
it's got that turf profile
it's got that purple color
and it produces some plants that are
just incredible enormous
plants and he's done really good
work breeding
his line using that genetic
and so it's something that
unfortunately because
of over production and
because not all
production is high quality
in you know all markets
you know Oregon, California
a lot of outdoor gets
an unfair
negative
association just because
there is subpar
product that is
the vast majority of what's
getting produced and then people
overlook what's really high quality
product and so I think Jager
has fallen victim to some
of it's own success in that regard
I think that
also is a time frame on
you know how long logistically
it takes you to receive that
product and are you on
the east coast and it's you know
potentially a year
post harvest
before some people take
ownership of products so you have
a gold bean effect but I've seen Jager
in multiple black
market states I've seen it grown in
Oregon and I for me I thought
it was a decent production plant
that was kind of unique but I also
just kind of wondered why people were
you know were dogging on it but I guess
that does make total sense
but at the same time
you know for me those are the cultivars
that ultimately
kind of you know people
associate that with Oregon
as a whole so I mean is that bad publicity
if it's publicity?
I mean it is something
that going forward this is
totally off the subject
but
as
most
states should adopt California has
begun to adopt an Appalachia
program and
something like that where you can actually
tie a cultivar to a place
and have a geographical indicator
I know Raymond
was up here last week and started talking
about that a little bit but
that idea is
something that where
right now it may be
a joke on Instagram
long term may actually
be a value added for
farmers in that area who
can actually ascribe a
geographic indicator to that
particular cultivar and
have it associated with an Appalachia
Well it's also finding the standards
to be able to say hey just because
you know someone is
a cultivator and they live within
that geographic area that doesn't necessarily
make that
for me
you know it's like they're kind of just
potentially tying
onto the name of the area
based upon the farms that are actually doing it right
so that's where I think that
standards need to kind of
be put in place to say hey you know this
operation is operating at
this level if they're going to be in the
commercial space so that way there's
ways to be able to
I guess rank everything
or maybe that's just kind of
just my chaotic mind
trying to simplify everything
at the same time but I think until
we have some type of structure
in regards to
being able to
rank
operations that we are going to have
a lot of
flexibility
and I think that's
where I think it's
going to be a real
interesting problem when it comes to
inconsistencies from one market to the
next
absolutely
but I think
yeah the whole Appalachia discussion
is an interesting one and it's kind of
a local discussion from state to state
I'm going to get into some breeding stuff though
Tony had been talking about
some of Gene's work and
this year I did
I did quite a bit of work with
different cultivars and varieties
from Jackson
we got
five males
and three females
of the sky cuddler kush that were
grown out by Bam and
I think it was like 2000 seeds
that he popped and made the selection
from and so
we made an F4 increase
out of those eight plants
and we also
hit it to the lemon tree and
gushers and
some other cookies
hype thing
that was just
they were clones, they were there
and available so like
Tree said earlier
and Kamere often
mentions when pollen's flying
put whatever you've gotten flower
over there so we made those crosses
we also
took the Pina F4
I got some pollen from the ranch
he gave me some
Pina F4 pollen that we then
hit to our own Pina
F4
I had a pack of Pina F4
and we popped those
and hit both of the females that we had
grown out full term
with the Pina F4
pollen from the ranch so we've
got the F5s of that
the F4s of the sky cuddler
kush and
we also grew out a bunch of the
Pina 88G13
hash plant cross that
I had made a couple years ago
and
those are really nice, that's some of my favorite
smoke this year
but we selected a male
from that and the male has
a really intense
pineapple like aroma
we selected it with like
6 or 7 other people and
everybody was in agreement that
out of the entire group this was
the most pineappley of
all of the males in the batch
and so we kept that one
and
I remember later on just going
and dusting a bunch of plants
and as I was dusting
plants getting this super intense
pineapple smell so
I'm super excited about
the Pina hash plant crosses that
we made and I've talked about the
TKM10 quite
a bit on here and I'm sure people have
heard about it so that work
was done but
definitely did a number of things
that all stem from
Gene's work
be it the SkyCuddler
Kush or the
Pina
and all those are
you know, they're not necessarily the
biggest names or the most hype
varieties that he's got
but I think they're all
very very nice
oh we also have the GMO root beer
that we hit to the Pina hash plant
and yeah
that GMO root beer's got
very intense
GMO terps
but on top of that
people have been mentioning that it's
kind of, it smells like
onion rings
and
bad breath
and like soda
it's weird, it's got an extra fizzy pop
to it that
you can see where that
root beer kind of
gives its influence and that's something I've
noticed with Jackson's breeding work
that's really unique is that he
I know Bam
did some extractions
with Jackson's kefir lime
and some other varieties
and one thing that always came through with
Jackson's work was a certain fizzy
characteristic where it almost
it's like the terps pop
in a unique way and they've got
it's almost like it's
a soda pop where it just like
in your face terps
as opposed to you know
just
you know the traditional
terps that we're used to it has an extra
sort of fizzy loudness
and I think that
while I haven't had the root beer itself
I think that's
something that's coming through in that
particular cultivar
What makes up the root beer?
Ah
there's Bam, I was just telling him
what you're talking about
Hey Bam, yeah you
you process that kefir lime
and some of those other, the cherry limeade
some other flavors from Jackson
back in the day
Hey yeah, what's up? What's up everybody?
Sorry about that, my name was
wringled in that year
What are you guys talking about?
So, what about the cherry limeade?
What's going on? Bring me up to speed
Just talking about Jackson's
I was commenting
specifically on the
fizzy terps that Jackson has
in some of his gear, something that
really like, I remember
the kefir lime and the cherry
limeade
extracts that you made both had that
really unique terp that
it didn't just, it wasn't
just like a smooth
traditional terp
there was an extra sort of pop to it
Yeah, I'd say more so with
with the cherry limeade than
the cherry lime pop
But definitely he has some pretty amazing
terps and
he's also an amazing grower so like
making the extracts even easier
I want to say that
one of those two was in the flower form
was like 4% terps
something ridiculous which
always translates into excellent
extract flavor wise
and yield wise
Yeah, I think the
Black Climbed Reserve, it won
the second place
2014 Emerald Cup
or 2015
with
almost, yeah
like 5% terps, it was 4%
in change but it was
incredible and it was only 18%
cannabinoid
profile so
just goes to show you don't need
that high THC, what you really
need is that entourage
effect of everybody
Yeah, to this day
I don't think I've smoked anything that's in the
30s that competes with some of the stuff
that I like that's down in the
high teens and the low 20s
It's just a number
right, at the end of the day it comes down to the entire
composition and then there's
body chemistry and what
resonates with you
and I think one thing that like
I don't want to be here talking
about a lot in cannabis is
like aside from the
entourage effect, just how complicated
the entourage effect
can be when you start factoring
in like chirality
and stereo and entomers
of compounds
if people are unaware of what
that means
I'm sure
everybody's familiar with D-limonene
right, D-limonene
refers to like the right-handed
version of limonene
almost, the vast
majority of compounds that are found
naturally occur
in
a D or an L format
and so basically if you look at your
hands, your hands are identical
yet you can never put
one directly on top of the other
perfectly, the thumb
is always going to point in a different direction
but other than that, the structure
and the orientation of your two hands
are the same, that is
what you call a stereo enantiomer
and
that's why we have D-limonene, L-limonene
and if you look
in
chemistry
we're not that good at
manufacturing
just one of those compounds
but to give you an
example of how powerful
the differentiation can be
there's a reason why
the minimum dosage of a standard
ibuprofen pill is 200 mg
it's because when we manufacture
it we get a racemic mix
which means that both
both
compounds are manufactured
if we could only
select for the one
that was, that had the
desired effect that we were looking
for, we would only need
5 mg as opposed
to 200 mg
because we don't have
the tech down to do that
we have to take 200
mg of a mixed
batch to get the same effect
as 5 mg
of a specific batch
I believe that
there are
similar
compounds within cannabis
not necessarily THC but
members of the entourage
posse and maybe some of the
cannabinoids that also have
this kind of a balance
and
the own, and nature
is actually the best at differentiating
the manufacture
of one or the other
they use enzymes
nature uses enzymes and builds
enzymes that make it so that
it's like
a key in a lock model
you can put
components of the compound
in it's building block stage
in a specific
orientation so that when
chemical reactions occur
it forces it in one
direction, only reason I know
this is because when I was younger
I worked in a lab and we were doing
research on how to use almonds
to make
a very specific
enantiomer
of Prozac because apparently
in the early
stages, some of the
precursor molecules to the finished product
of Prozac
are also
used in almonds
but almonds actually
have the enzyme that forces
the reaction to
go in one direction as
opposed to the other so like
if you can start off with your precursor
molecules and start
forcing the direction in one way
you have a much higher
finished
result down the line
so I would say that with
cannabinoids and terpenes
and all the other bioavailable
special compounds in cannabis
we have those factors too
and
I think that those factors play
a much more significant role than
percentage THC
That was really awesome, thank you for that
My pleasure
Marissa, you've been up
here for a while, did you have a question or
a comment?
You know, I've just, I hopped
off of a call just now so I just jumped back
into the room, I think earlier
I had something to
say but now I'm just sitting back here
enjoying listening to you guys talk, you're doing a
great job. I think earlier I wanted to make a
comment that you know, honestly
as much as we're talking
about you know, all of these
crossbreeds and
all the cheeses and all the
beautiful moving forward
I think earlier the point I wanted to make
is don't forget you guys, we have enough
get high genetics out there to last
us lifetimes and
as long as we're going into this talking
about you know, terpenes, cannabinoids
whatever it is that's given us that stinky
stink that we like and
following you know, what your nose knows and
picking genetics that you're fiending
after yourself, even though they might not be
getting you higher, don't forget
that we're developing things that medicine
wise, you know, we're drawn
to these things and we're being
drawn to breed some of
these plants that might not
necessarily, you know, we're liking stinky
for a reason and I think that even though it
might not be getting you as high as you want it to
some of these other genetics hold on to them and
keep them close, keep developing
them out. There's a lot of uses out there besides
you know, that heavy high that we love
so anyway, thank you for
thanks for acknowledging me. This is Marisha
I am complete and
you guys keep going because I'm just loving this conversation
I think you'll get
100% agreement from the stage
and the audience
High terpenes
I'm diving into that
Roberts Creek Congo and that thing is producing
some gnarly ass
plants and the hybrids. She
she likes to breed true for her
her high terpene profile
so far everyone that's random
likes what they're finding
I found some killer stuff in the
cross with the space cheese and the ghost
OG Kim dog special reserve
trying to retain that high terpene
profile that she's known for
she's high and high and terpenolene
and carathelene
she breeds for pretty
true finding it quite a few
the project
so if anyone else is out there that's got
put her across
your high terpene lines and you're going to find
some magic in that thing sits through the seeds
dock and find something
killer just like
the GMO find
your GMO find your unicorn
out there
I always tell people one of my favorite
plants that I
will make one day is going to be
called the two percenter and it's just going to be two percent
two percent two percent two percent
two percent two percent all
the way across the board
the
hard part about breeding for different
cannabinoids well two things
not a lot of people
want them at this point in time
so it's hard to get people hyped
up on weird cannabinoids that don't
get you wasted but I believe
in them and I'm always going to be working them
but number two is
they cost a lot
you got to test those things
you got to test them for
cannabinoids that don't get you high
you know if you can't smell it you can't feel
it then you know
you don't know it's there so
anybody want to sponsor me on
test man I'm ready to do
the work but that's the hardest part
man test is
the son of a bitch
I think one of the hardest
or the biggest problems with testing is that
we're limited
by the number of cannabinoids and terpenes
and compounds that are actually
available to test
it's pretty
well known that my favorite strain is
like the Urkel right and so
I spent a lot of time
making extracts with the Urkel
and doing
testing and
there is a terpene
that I don't know which one
it is I know how to smell it
I can sniff it out
but I've taken it
to a bunch of different labs that
do all sorts of numbers of terpenes
and
nothing on those
results seems
to reveal what it is
that I'm looking
for I mean so it gets back to the nose
nose because you put like a bunch
of pounds in front of me and I'll
smell it out I know what I'm looking
for because it's what resonates with me
personally
and it triggers something
in me like which
is why it's my favorite strain
so as much as
I love testing
I just really would love to see
a
greater accessibility of
a wider range of compounds
being identified that
we can actually turn into like some useful
data sets because
when I did have the budget and I did
the testing I still wasn't able to find what I
wanted what I was looking for
man
I feel you 100%
man that's the thorn in my
side you know all the tests are
incomplete you know it's like
we're getting there we're getting there but
you're right and it's impossible
they don't let anybody do it anymore and there's
always different law changes
lab rules and state
rules and all that stuff
just makes it hard you know it makes it real hard
but yeah no it's fun
and needs to happen
I definitely
one thing I like doing too
and I've been
working on this is trying
to you know get
these clone only's like Urkel because I
love Urkel as well and
Grandaddy Purple and so
one of the projects I'm
working on now is going
to be trying to find an
Urkel dominant male from
grape line made that
I hit with Girl Scout Cookies
that way I can really kind of
I got some back crosses from
CSI regular so that you could
use to put into that if you'd like
yeah and just try
to also I mean she's a little bit
slower growing
to you know help a little bit with
vegetative growth but I
feel like as well as you know
terpenes and
everything of that nature trying
to breed as
to you know make
it the plant a little bit easier
to grow for some people
that are you know just getting
into this and aren't you know an expert
at doing it being able to
produce things
that people can
do with shit soil
and you know bare minimum
knowledge still produce a quality product
for themselves is also pretty
important because
you know I ran through
a bunch of Berry Freak
seeds which are
you know a freak show
variant and you know
it's a great novelty plant
but man I was you know
not a big fan
of how it grew in the vegetative
state it was
you know cool looking with its leaves
and whatnot and I
currently have
ABC going
Australian Bastard Cannabis and
it's really
impressive to
see the
complete variation
that this plant can
be you know
seeing Berry Freak
and seeing ABC
and then having a narrow
leaf and then a broad leaf cultivar
seeing them together it's just
kind of mind blowing that these are all
related and yet
they're so different
I just
I find that there's a lot
of different
things to select for
when trying to breed and
you know trying to either
whether you're preserving or you're
trying to breed to make a
more commercially viable
strain or do
try to make a
new clone only or try to
reinvigorate clone only
like there's a lot of different
avenues you can
you know kind of venture towards
when you're breeding and have different
kind of different ideals and
you know not it's not necessarily
all about oh I need to hit this
to all the new stuff and you know
try to make
money like there's a lot of
work that I
feel like doesn't necessarily get done
by some people and you know
there's others that really
put in the time like you
Tony you know you put in the time
you made your male and you've worked
that male for a long time
and that was definitely something
that really drew me to you
and looked up to you
as a breeder
and then you know meeting
Jackson talking to him
running his genetics and one
thing that I feel like I really
took from him was
what he
I feel like he breeds
a lot of cultivars that
are very similar growing
and have you know
either similar profiles
or similar structure this that
and the other to where it makes
his first
you know filial generation
so stable that
you know it's like wow you know
you don't see too much variation
you really just kind of get
difference in
flavors and this that
and the other like with the black lime reserve
I was extremely impressed with how
stable every pheno really
was and looked
between each other
it definitely
taught me you know
if I want to produce a really
stable line early on this is
you know something I need to look
towards doing
so it's just really cool
to kind of see everybody's
ideals when they're
doing their own thing
and you know
it really kind of I feel like
separates everybody from one
another as well
just kind of with how
they do their own
thing so
Hey Lucas I just
wanted to add to what you were saying
I know a lot of people
have this perception that Urkel
is like a slow veger
or slow grower
and once upon a time
I was of that opinion but I think at the
end of the day really what it comes down to with
different strains is
sterile phenotypes
right they respond to their environment
and everything
else around them the magic for
me for Urkel was basically
switching to a pulse feeding
with a sort of a crop
steering model multiple
waterings per day
and
going into a wider pot rather than
a deeper pot those
two tips will actually
turbo charge your
Urkel and
I promise that like if you try those
techniques out on the Urkel you'll
see that it's not a slow grower
it's actually a fast grower
I think that
we just have to adapt
to how the plants want to respond
and that was the trick that worked for me
I appreciate that
personally I haven't grown her yet
I've only smoked her
I have a good buddy
his name's
Laserface on IG
and he was
grateful enough to share that
with me and where he's
helping me work this
Urkel into seed and so I
appreciate that because she's just a
little baby right now
and she made it with
the cold weather out here in Colorado
so I'm really excited
for her she's doing good
but I have
I feel like I've noticed that as well
just from the
ideals of
the people in
Northern California
and even you know all
in the Pacific
Northwest growing these giant
plants in much wider pots
and they are tall
and I personally started doing that
I will
when I transplant I grow in
grow bags
people probably hate them
I have good experience with them
I start
I roll them down
and do just half the grow bag
and that's what I transplant
into every time I'm up potting
and as
the plant wedges out and gets bigger
then I add soil
top dress feeding
and compost
to the top just over time
and it definitely
I can veg out a 5 foot
plant in you know
a 2 gallon grow bag
and so I definitely have noticed
that it works a lot better if you have
a wider pot than you have a tall pot
but I will also
take into consideration that
watering technique so I appreciate that
yeah no problem
I found at least for
me 5 times a day
watering
with a goal of like 20% runoff
just
set that thing into like
the most unbelievable growth
I mean I've grown it for a long
time
and
it's only taken me
years and years to come to that conclusion
but that's a game changer
because now
something that I can grow
in more abundance
I never have enough
Are you running
like an organic system
or cocoa?
What exactly is your
soil media?
I'm running in the
bio 365
bio cocoa
mix of cocoa and biochar
so
so
I mean up here in the coastal
mountains of Santa Cruz
especially in the winter in an unheated greenhouse
peat just does not
cut it, it holds too much water
and I can't get
the
I can't get the pots to dry out
in a manner that
keeps the plants happy
I really like the bio cocoa
it's a great blend of cocoa
and biochar, the biochar
acts like a reef for microbials
and new storage
and makes the application
of
of organics
more viable in the cocoa format
but then I get great air
holding capacity as well as
as
water retention so
for my environment
and for my climate I'm finding
I'm having just phenomenal
results, it's my first run
making that change
and
I just, I couldn't be happier
And does that
have any sort of
aeration media like
perlite or vermiculite or
anything?
None, it's awesome, that's one of the reasons
I really love it, it doesn't have perlite
it doesn't have, I mean I think it might have
some pumice, it might
have some pumice
but when you
run your hands through it
you're not feeling any grit
it seems like they did a really good
job of mixing up the two different types
of cocoa, like chunk and
like pith
with the biochar
so it doesn't have perlite
it doesn't need it
I actually like the fact that it doesn't
have much
aeration stuff, it doesn't need it
Hey Bam, over on
YouTube, Billy
Kosich asked if you
run out of juice in the end
What is he
asking?
I assume if you run
if like you run
if the nutrients are lagging
at the end
I haven't
found that the nutrients to be lagging
at the end, no, honestly
embarrassed to
embarrassed to say it but due to budgetary
constraints
I ran out of
food at some
points and
I've gone up to like a week and a half
without having to feed anything
and I think that the biochar
really does
serve as a nutrient
reef and
so I think that maybe if you
were under
planning or under shooting, you might
be able to, you might run into that
but like I said I've gone
almost two weeks
without having to feed
So you don't amend
you basically
water feed
is what you're saying
too
I do both, in the winter time
it's more water feed
in the summer
I'll do
more amendments
Okay, cool
Do you do any
top dressings, like say you just
transplanted into flower and I usually
like to top dress
around week three or so
do you do anything of that nature?
Sure
but mostly like biologicals
and I might add
some like, there's this product from
Sensational Solutions called
Cafe Mag which is like
calcium, magnesium and iron
but like
I like to top dress with
and then
Lainbanite
is always a great
finisher to top dress with
Well I guess
I don't know where I cut off earlier
when I lost signal
I'll
kind of go into
what I'm working
on at the moment
kind of have like a
long term plan probably over
the next five to seven years
of right now
working kind of like an OG line
and then
you know get a lot of
good OGs into a seed form
that I like
and then I plan
to transition kind of more
into the grape
profiles, grape and citrus
work into those
I'm really big fan of both of those
I do have
an incredible
haze that I
did when I was
out in California a while
ago
it was Melange Gold
that I ended up hitting
to a ghost train haze
male that I found that was really nice
I ended
up actually taking Jackson's
some of that Melange Gold
Phenol and gave him
about half the seeds that I did
make and
took him some nugs and he broke it open
he was like oh man this is like
some of that old school
Colombian type stuff and so
ever since then I was like oh
that's something
special so I ended up
cracking into those because I kind
of wanted to add a little
bit something different for some
head stash and not necessarily
breeding projects
but now
that I've kind of posted about it I've
had people ask me if I'm going to release
anything with it and
I don't necessarily plan to off
the bat but I
definitely feel like it would be
something that would
fit in nice to
my heavenly days that I
ended up doing and that is super
silver haze that I hit
to the original
two black lime reserve males that I
found that were
absolute stunners
extremely thick stamen
clusters
really nice and frosty and they
turned like a gorgeous
burgundy near the
end as well
and so I ended up collecting a lot
of polymorphobultos guys and
I hit that to
about five
of the females that I ended
up creating a line with which was
Girl Scout Cookies
Girl Scout OG
which is Scouts OG to Girl Scout
Heavenly Days
I did my lime breath
reserve that absolutely
a lot of people
have been raving about
I did have a buddy of
mine that actually ended up popping
just one seed out of the
pack and he ended up
finding the lime skunk pheno
that is my
keeper pheno
I ran through
about 50 of them
when I
got last winter
and I liked
all of them except
for three and
the three that I didn't like, they were great
it's just I was being
quite picky and
I ended up keeping two males
out of that
population and
I had
23 females
I ended up keeping as well
and so I ended up
hitting a branch of each of
those making
a decent population
of F2s and then
I'm currently making a
batch of F2s
that are hit specifically to
my lime skunk pheno
that my buddy found
and so
that's
right now
mainly doing
specific kind of OG crosses
a lot of mine kind of intermingled
I'm doing
my cognac OG
which is my OG reserve to
King's reserve
which is just ghost OG to
BLR and
King Louie 13 to
Black Lime Reserve so mixing those
together I found
two really nice phenos of
King's reserve and then I have
my
I'm sorry my OG
reserve and then I have my
King's reserve
F1 male
that was really dense
thickly clustered
male with a lot of
resin and very
strong fuel
profile to him so I
collected a good amount of pollen to
play with him
so I've just been hitting to
him to
some clone only OGs
and
I had a King Louie
back cross number 2 from
seed that I had traded
from Dank by Pink
and those came out
very nice they're extremely
I'll post some seeds up
here soon I'm about to
shuck the buds of them
I did end up
popping some
garlic sherbert that
I had the pheno I
have now I actually found a
seed out of a quarter
pound and it is
a stellar S1
I was very impressed
with it but I was able to also
source an original pack
and I popped the
rest of those
recently
and so I'm
excited to kind of compare the
S1 to the originals
and see if I
would I
select from there so I
do kind of plan to hit the
garlic sherbert with some lime breath
reserve
I did try to reverse
the garlic sherbert and
I did not have any luck with that
but I think it was
it was just so densely
clustered
that it didn't really want to drop
pollen and I even
threw it back into the
bedroom
and to try to
get it to
length out a bit by putting
it back on an 18 hour schedule
and it didn't really do that so
I'm going to try it again and try it with
some gibberellic acid and see if
I can get some stretch so I can
maybe get some pollen to drop from her
because I would definitely like to
hit her to some clonal
leaves so I'm kind
of doing some intermixed
projects as well as doing
my OG line at the moment
trying to get OG kush
breath into a nice stable
seed form
and I'm thankful for the
ranch that Trevor had
mentioned earlier he had shared
the OG kush breath pheno that
he has and
it looks exactly like the ones I've always
seen so I trust it's
that cut and I
have a meat breath
F2 male I found that looks
exactly like her
and he's pretty nice
he's got some thick clusters
and a lot of pollen and he's got
some frost on him
so I think that will turn out real nice
I sent him some of the pollen as well
and he plans to
play with it I know he's going to
do a mean
mug that he ended up getting from
Gene and some other
stuff but
yeah just kind of working
through my seeds I
have too many of them and need to get
pocket on them
I know Tony had shared
a ChemDoc
special reserve
fuel cut that
or fuel line
I should say that Kevin Jodry had
shared with him and so
I found two males
and two females from
those that I liked
and I'm about to hit the
two females with that pollen
so make some F2s
of those and send some back
to Tony so he can
hunt those
you have to have F3s of those actually
because they're F2s that I got
oh well then
that makes them F3s brother
oh well alrighty
I forgot to label those
I was pretty sick when I sent them to you
so I probably will have to label them completely
yeah and I'm so glad
dude I'm so glad
I'm sorry for interrupting
they're going to breed really true for like
the guard dog side of that
of that line that's in there
it comes out killer fuel
yes yes
definitely I
flowered the two females out
that I did like
actually yeah I ended up
with two females
forgot how many seeds totaled two females
like three or four males
I was like two of the males and then
I think the rest of the seeds didn't pop
which were only I think you gave
me like 10 or so
so that will be
that will be a good line to
look through and hopefully keep extending
but I do plan to hit
hopefully make like a
chem dog special reserve
bat cross with
black lime reserve male F2
that I ended up really liking
as well
I'm going to obviously
keep continuing the black lime
reserve line
and F3s I have some
F3s that a buddy
sent F2s he selected
towards you know lime dominant
females so I do also
plan to pop some of those
one question I've always had
is if you
hit say an F4
to an F2 what would
you what filial kind of generation
would that be
it would be a
in cross right there to the line
it's not it would be a brand new
F1
they're now the new
parents to the brand new line
you have a ticket to a filial
generation you're not doing a direct
bat cross and you haven't
selfed that line so
you basically created a brand new F1
with genetics that
are related so
there it's a beginning
if you write that
on a package on the cannabis industry
today they're going to try to ream your ass for saying
you have an inbred line instead of trying
to document exactly what you're doing with a line
that you began inbreeding
it by doing that
some people think you have to do just an S1
some folks believe you've got to do a
back cross to the original parent some
folks think you got to do F generation
and all those are just different
forms of inbreeding
so you could be in your
inbreeding for a brand new direction with them
if you find something out of that new
F1 you can go in all
different directions with different
siblings from that
or you can open populate and increase the line
like you'd want to do with the
the Kimdog special reserve
I sent you and I do have more seeds of those
if you want them to sift through
I also have a mango pheno
mango male that
Kevin had in there
and the ghost
Kimdog special reserve
that I used
you sent me some of those too
I have both of those still
I just popped the fuel
the OG
Kimdog special reserve those are going to have
more OG structure on the plants
they're going to be taller, more spear
shaped buds but you're going to retain
that same profile
and even a little more fleer sides
than the cushier side of
what's coming through on some of the star dogs
some of the star dogs
less fuely
I don't know how to explain it
than the ghost side
they're both killer though
all of those that I've ran
Levi did with them and I've done with them
they're killer
yeah definitely
it's something special
I would definitely like to
also I'm going to hit it
with the
King's Reserve male that I ended up
keeping around
that was really nice
that OG
CDSR
has definitely got my interest
for some of the upcoming seeds
I plan to pop
I also have OG
hit 2 Skyjaro
that Jackson did I got some of those
that definitely has my interest
to look through
because I do
I love that Skyjaro
I just popped some
of the Skyjaro number 5
that I had ran probably 5 or 6 years
ago
so I popped 3 of those
that I ended up having
I don't know where I honestly
found them
so we'll see what they look like
I don't plan to necessarily
breed with it I just want to
find that original kind of smoke
that I did in the original
Jackson had sent me
fingers crossed find something
there
but that Skyjaro I feel like
is definitely an underrated
cultivar from him
because it's very
similar to root beer but
it's I don't know that Skywalker
G cut to me
personally it's something super special
Levi had
a really killer Skywalker
cut that I loved
and man like every
time I would smoke it I
couldn't plan to do anything except
for like sleep and eat
I got that thing for you
brother I'm going to get it sent over to you
well we might need
to wait till spring because it's getting
like 18 to 10
degrees at night so it's getting pretty
cold out here so I might have to wait till
like spring time
I'll get you that G cut and the
space cheese out to you
and that fire OG
anything you want
you see like orange turps you want that Congo
it's got this electric orange on that
thing that it's like
it's insane brother I'm telling you
it'll burn the fucking hairs out of your nose
when you fucking touch the plant
it's the loudest plant in my garden
period
it sounds like a
yeah I'd definitely be interested in that
it's louder than
anything I got in the garden
it's fucking insane
that's how my
I dubbed it goat haze
just
I don't know stupid name but
that's how that melange gold
crosses it's the
loudest thing in the garden I mean
I got a bunch of fuel I have
my GMO OG that's
just straight stank
but that dude the
intense
I call it's just that intense
like haze smell I don't know
Trevor talks about
and I don't know if that's
what it is because I've smelled jack
and I don't feel like it's
quite that jack smell but it's just
that incredible that haze
and I feel
like this phenol is even more
intense than the phenol I took
with Jackson back in
2014 I think it was
it's definitely
something special
I'm going to be running it for head stash
but I'll definitely need
to run it through the ringer and do
some a couple years
of testing of just you know how
it does with over water how it does with
too much heat how it does with
too much light
how it does with light interruption
you know just go through every
single
stress test and make sure that
it can pass all boxes
and if it doesn't maybe
maybe release it
but you know warn people
you know if you have this and this
you know it's going to be susceptible
to herming at that
or you overnutriate it
it might herm out on you
I don't know I'm on the
fence about that
but I feel like if you do warn
people because like you know
cherry pie is great and it's
known to herm out you know thankfully
it's sterile but
you know if there's certain things
that you know it's like it won't herm
majority of the part
unless you really really
just fuck up and just you know
overnutriate the hell out of
her and then she's going to throw something then you
got to worry
but if it's stable for the most
part of that nature
you know so I don't know it's a fine
line that I've been kind of
talking about with a couple other people
just how they feel about that
and what are their thoughts on
it ethics on it
but I definitely
feel like unfortunately there's some
really good cultivars out
there that are just going to be
susceptible to certain things
Tony
you said Congo is
super orange herps is that more like
a like a big
California orange
or like
a tangerine dream
or something of that nature
or is it kind of an older
school orange herp profile
or is it something new kind of like
a mimosa or
something like any other orange
that's out there right now
she's
it's hard to explain the orange that she
comes across as it's not
a direct orange it's there's this citrus
profile that comes across as like
lemon
orange grapefruit
combined with like
a body odor
kerosene I mean it's
she's so complex and
depending on the inputs that you put
her under and the
spectrum of light you put on her she's
going to produce a little bit more here and there
stuff and come across a little differently in
each yard but like
the
concentrate from her is
killer you want to if you're going to press that
stuff press her extremely low so
you don't lose the terpene profile
but man the high comes off
of that thing is just wicked
she's some of the best smoke she puts me on
my rear man like most weed don't
do that to me I can smoke
ounces of whatever you got I'm talking
concentrate buds
very few lines just make me stop
in my tracks and she's one of them she
just makes me want to
enjoy what I'm doing
in that moment I want to stop
and just contemplate everything
but I don't want to get up dude
that's how she was
even if I
didn't have this missing leg I wouldn't get the fuck
up
I've sent her out to a few people that are
my age or older so that's the
generation that might have smoked it I've sent it out to
some folks that are
pushing 60s just to see what
they would respond to it and they all
say it reminds them of
the high they had back in high school
when they were younger kids man
it's killer weed and everyone
that's grown it I've passed a few putts
with it just to get the
understanding of other people
believe it's as loud as I think it is and
they all say the same thing I've sent
multiple cuts from cherry pie
to the Bruce banner
I've sent SFVs
and not
the triangle what was it the Topanga
I've sent all those across with that
Congo and everyone that's grown them
side by side says the same thing that that Congo
is just insane it's louder
it's a better high
it just takes long it's
a 12 week strain she wants to go 12 weeks
for sure in there but that for me
that's nothing I'm used to growing shit
10 and 11 weeks already
so pushing an extra week isn't
hard but a lot of people want that weed right
now they want it out of there so I tell
them to set up a system where
you're you're rotating
your flower room and have a
bedroom so you can introduce
plants in there on a staggered set
up and pool every
six weeks once you've got one row done
and then you got your herb all the time
Yeah
see that and that's what I kind of do with
I've been doing with this
melange crosses
I've just you know put a couple plants
and you know I'll go
and that one I
top dress a little bit later in the flower
but you know I just go over to her and smell
her once in a good while and just
remind how good she gets
but I don't look at her to
harvest her really
and then
lately I've
I've been looking
at kind of what is
her best terpene
profile range like what days
because I've noticed with
plants like I usually
like a more
you know couch lock
I like more amber trichomes
and so I
a while ago I
used to let things just go and go and
go and they would be like almost 50%
you know amber
and but I've noticed it would
wouldn't be as
high in terpene
profile it wouldn't you know
it wouldn't smell as great and so I've
been definitely trying to find
that fine line of
harvesting of you know winters
or peak terpene content but
you're also kind of getting
into you know amber
trichomes to give you that a little bit
more narcotic effect
and
you know with the with the haze
it you know you don't really even get
amber you just
really get these nice milky
heads and so
yeah for me I
just have really been
into finding which cultivars
like peak terpene
content
is and trying to cut it around that
time
the I was just
been thinking about that haze that I
was
trying to figure out what terp profile that I was
actually selecting out of
and it was Borneol
which I'm going to probably mangle this
Borneol
I think
that's how you profile
it definitely had
more of like a
minty fresh kind of
almost like a mentholato
is the best way
it kind of reminds me of like whenever
I was younger
Tiger Balm
do you remember that
smell? Yeah I get that
we used to have a line that we
called it Ben Gay because it smelled like
the Ben Gay rub that you put on your body
which is filled with menthol
and it smells exactly what you're
talking about it was so strong
but this plant grew so small
and tiny like indoor I could never
get that plant to get over 4 feet tall
outdoor she would get about 6 feet
tall and she finished extremely
fast light green
it was killer weed
man I used to get it from this one
specific cat around here that my mom
my uncle Jim knew
he grew that shit for years
we'd buy ounces from him all the time
he wouldn't kick down those seeds from it
we looked for seeds for years
because that menthol flavor was awesome
it was so killer
Bam I don't know
if we covered it I was just upstairs
making dinner but what
were you focused on this year
and kind of what are your
what are you going to focus on
next year
who is that for
that was for Bam
what am I going to
focus on next year
yes
right now
but start rewind
to this year though
alright where do you want me to begin
laughing
this year
I had
the experience of working
in the recreational market
got to do some
big population hunts
through some of the hazes and that was
fun
it was really nice to be able to do such a
large hunt and
see the diversity
and all the populations that I did
I am no longer working in the recreational
market and
I am
consulting on a couple
of different
projects that are
in different recreational
markets
but I think what I'm
most excited about is I have
a hemp research license
and
I am doing
I'm working on putting together
a deal with a
a company in
the hemp space that is doing
some very forward
looking work
and I'm looking to
basically leverage
my facility
and my experience and skill set
in
helping to develop and isolate
traits and lines
with the
assistance of some
partners in the genomics department
so that's exciting
I can't
I can't give too much more
detail about it at this point
but that's what I'm looking
forward to, I'm looking forward to embarking
on larger
research projects
that
where the
focus of the project is actually
research and that
research isn't a byproduct
of production
that's kind of
what I was doing
in the rec space
was working
at a production house but
trying to get some research
in
and hybridize
the production and research
model which is interesting
it's great, I'm really glad that
I was able to participate
in that and do that
but that has its own limitations
and confines
and I think that we were pretty creative
about working around them
I think what I'm most excited about is
working with a company that
is just focused on
research rather than
production and then
has all of
the scientist
and equipment
to do the genomic analysis
in scale
so
as a breeder
as a
smaller independent breeder
genomic
testing is not super
affordable or accessible
to the public
so
there are some companies
out there that are offering a limited
number of markers
but I'm
excited to work with a company
that has a larger set
of markers to
work with and then
get to play in the field and then
hopefully expand some
of that research into
the production
it will all be HEMPA based
but there's so much interesting work
to do in space
we're literally talking about the same plant
just different levels of THC
so there's all the different
characteristics that are
important, trichome size
color, resistance
height, and then the
wide range of cannabinoids from
varins
to
CBG, CBC
and then terpenes
so as a breeder just kind of like
shifting that focus away
from THC
dominant strains and then just kind of like
going in
on individual
characteristics which
when the legal climate presents
itself in a
manner that is
will allow
me to be a breeder from my homestead
where I live and not have to move counties and jump
through a bunch of
fucking regulatory hurdles
then if I have that
bank of traits
I can take
that with me and that will be easy
to plug and play the THC
component
it's part
of what 2022
is going to be about to me
is adapting to a hostile regulatory
framework in a shitty county
that doesn't have any
respect for legacy farmers or breeders
adapting to that and trying
to make the best
out of what isn't
a great situation
simultaneously while I'm doing that I'm continuing
to do my advocacy work
and fighting
the county at a local level
to open
up
their process
and make that more accessible to
legacy farmers who've been here for a long
time
I'd say that's
that's BAM's world in a nutshell
you like your uphill
battles
it's not a battle if you're just
sliding on your ass all the way down
I mean
if we're
I like battles because I'm
a dreamer and I'm an
idealist and I have my principles and I
have my beliefs
I still have
hope that
there is some semblance
of democracy and representation
and equality before the
law and all the other
things that we were promised
and
being a member of the
cannabis community and
having to deal with
the war
on cannabis and the subsequent
botch
from transition from
2015 to 64
I definitely
have felt
emasculated and
castrated because
the
odds have been stacked against
some of us
depending on which counties we're in
and
I see too many
people
make decisions out of
fear
which I understand
and also out of
lack of a means
in terms of like financial
feasibility
to fight the fight
and I think that's what the oppressors often
bank on. They bank on the
fact that many people
will choose to settle out of fear
or out of the inability to find
adequate representation
and
I think that I've been on the shit end of the
stick too long in terms of
dealing with
battles with
the relevant authorities
and I'm just tired
I think that
we need to make a stand and there's people
like Trevor in this room who
did an amazing job
in his county and it's like
when you see those kind of victories out there
it puts fuel in the tank
so I don't care
I don't care how much of
an uphill battle
it is
call me
Sisyphus or Atlas
That's how I feel like
with my newborn
But you wouldn't have it any other way
because that's your baby, right?
And so like at the end of
the day after the
blood-sweated tears
there's
that feeling of
satisfaction
So Trevor
correct me if I'm wrong
correct me if I'm wrong
but I feel like this year was the year
of the hash plan
what's next year
going to be about?
I just had a
bit of a spill here
I'll come
back and chime in
in a minute
Got it
Mr. Elka
any peanut gallery
commentary?
From the East Coast
Land of Prohibition
Land of good smoke
don't get it twisted
And if you're talking
we can't hear you
but we can hear Trevor
Oh shit
It's supposed to be unmuted
I don't understand man
We can hear you now
Why is it always a fucking thing?
Can you hear me?
Yes we can
Alright
Not sure he can hear us though
He might have to
exit and come back out
Can you hear us Elka?
I'm just going to talk
I really appreciated
what Bam was saying earlier
I could give a shit if you all could hear me or not
I'm just going to speak
It looks like I'm unmuted
But what Bam was talking about
how you have to fight against the Prohibition
and everything
I appreciate that
but in some places
the battle
is a little bit too far up hill
if you know what I mean
Ask Nick about that
So
I appreciate that sentiment
and I get it
but like I said
it gets a little rough
in some places
but I was just sitting here
eating dinner after a long hard day
and appreciating what everybody was talking about
but the
on the skunk
I do have a
everybody's looking for the skunk
and I have an opinion on that
that may be a little bit
off
base
but think about the time frame
when we were all smoking that stuff
it was like
coming out of plastic bags
that had been shipped all over the place
and it was usually kind of
seated and stuff like that
and it was really funky
nasty shit
so I'm wondering if
those
since we have determined
that we are going to be
since we have determined
now that it's not terpenes
that are in it
that it's what we are looking for
we are looking for thiols or alcohols
or something like that
is maybe that packaging
from back in the day was like
trapping that shit in there
and like kind of holding it in
and like making it like
where we were smoking that nasty
weed that had been like
in tires
and door panels
and you know shipped all over
for months wrapped in plastic
and duct tape and shit
and you know like I said I don't even know
if you motherfuckers are hearing me right now
but I'm just talk talk talking
but it looks like that I'm unmuted
so I'm going to hit my
hit this button again and I figured out
before it's from the resin
on my fingers it's like when I
hit this phone there's like a little
thing on here and it won't like turn off
and on so
yeah that's
that's what I have to do
that's what I have to say about
prohibition and the
skunk that you all were talking about
and everything and
alright
so in response to the
prohibition thing like
the worse that it is
the harder you have to fight
that's my mentality and maybe I'm just
I'm jaded
and I've already lost so much
I've lost family I've lost so
much of my life to the fucking bullshit
of prohibition that like there ain't
shit for me to lose anymore so I don't care
what they're going to do come get me
do what you gotta do I'm not going to
fucking shut my mouth I'm going to keep speaking
truth I'm going to keep
speaking truth to power
and trying to raise awareness and do
what I can to like to
free cause like yo if I gotta
I'd rather be dead than
than live
oppressed and so
they want to any up
I'm down like if
I get martyred because they fucking
shoot me or like lock me up for the
rest of my life because I'm trying
to fight the good fight then that was
a fight and a life
worth living
that's just my two cents on that
but as far
as like the other comment
on skunk
while I see where you're going
with that Gary I do
believe that there was
a roadkill skunk
I remember smelling
it and seeing it and growing it and not
all of it was bunk there was
like dank headies and western masks
that was like some
skunk
the thing is
we all have a history of
skunk and here's the reality there wasn't one
cat growing this shit around the country
there was people that bought seeds from the
old catalogs that was labeled
either skunk one
roadkill skunk, shiva skunk
super skunk, sensi skunk
and by the time they hit your dealer that
you were buying that bag from in high school
they were selling you what he called skunk
by the time you got to the party half the people
there calling the shit roadkill skunk
cause it sounds cool there was nobody
passing genetic information with that
sack of weed you bought running to the party
on the weekends there was no way
that we all had the exact same
phenotype from the exact
same sift there's no way we all
believe that we all came across
the exact same thing what we
have is a memory of something
that we're chasing
and because we didn't know anything
about genetics at that time we have nowhere to
dive into besides the name on packs
these days and like
trees was talking about here
earlier and Kevin Jodery talks about
they are genetic lines
for you to dive into to find these
terpene profiles and
these esters and alcohols that you're looking
for you're going to have to breed it back in the line
you're not buying 10 seeds and finding
what everyone remembers because we all
didn't have access to that same
plant our memory is different
each one of us had a very different version
of what we believe roadkill
skunk was which came out
with a trademark name
by sensi skunk they're who came up with it
in the 90s and skunk was bred in the
70s so those cats
like I put a link on YouTube
earlier
I'll do it again it goes to a link on the
history of Arizona there's a grower named
Mad Jag that bought seeds from Robert
Connell Clark and
skunk
man Sam in 1978
and did a grow of
3000 seeds there Robert Clark
came back to the grow
and at no period in time at that
time were they calling anything roadkill skunk
because it wasn't a tag on the line
until it became a trademark
name did we start getting this passed
around in the 90s which is 20
years after the line was bred so
you two generations after and how
many different breeders version
till each one of us says we've smoked
skunk we're never going to agree on
I found roadkill skunk because
you didn't you
found a terpene profile from
a line that someone
named and trademark and you're searching for
someone already has
instead of looking for the
profiles that were after and you could
find them through testing you can find
them through sampling but you're not
going to find them just buying sex or
seeds that say skunk on them
because everybody's version of what they had
is skunk in the period was
different the guys that had it in 2000
smoke something different than the guys in the 90s
who smoked something different than like
myself had in the 80s
was different than the guys who smoked it
in the late 70s and we all
say we smoke skunk
so how do we agree on
the one that is
found is that or the line
that's going to be end up offered
is that that's why there's cats out here taking
advantage of this industry because
they're offering seeds
to people that weren't there in
the very beginning and don't want to
admit that there was multiple versions
of it and just chase what
you're looking for
better off looking for it in genetics
it's out there
well there's the people chasing
the name there's the people chasing
the memory there's the people chasing
the flavors what the
fuck you chasing man
you know
period you found the skunk
so if yours was from the 90s you need to research the breeders
that had it and who came before
them to try to find out which time
period you might be trying to find
the profile you were after
so if you were in the 90s you need to try to find
stuff that Simon was
working on or something that
Neville had after he got seeds
and then pass it to Simon
right so
like you have to research the actual
breeder and what he did
what time period so you can
find what you're looking for but you're better
off diving into those genetics the
Colombian the Acapulco Gold and the Afghans
and starting to cross breed those
and find
the combination that comes out of there because
that's where it came from that magic we're all
finding came from a hybrid cross
it's a very polyhybrid line
so again that also tells
you nobody
was getting the exact same cultivar
the same genotype even if it
was a true breeding line where there's four genotypes
that are going to come out of the line right there's two
main genotypes
and then two recessive genotypes
and then you have a true breeding F1 line
this is just how plants work
so even if we all had
access to a true breeding line there was four
genotypes that could have came out of there
and each one of those genotypes had
multiple phenotype expressions that
could have came out of there if you dive into
the phenotypical ratio and
the genotypical ratio on plants you'll
see what they come out the genotypes
1 to 1
and the phenotype is 9
3 3 2 1 that's
the expressions that you'll get through true breeding
seed lines so the
the fact
lies in that we all
did not have the same version of skunk
and we're all out there chasing this thing
for it can only be one
reason when you want to sell the seeds
and that's for profit if you're searching for it for
your own head that's a whole different story but
that's where we try to educate each other
on which lines to dig into
what crosses have we made in our own
gardens that bring up those profiles which
have we smoked that had it right
on the genetic basis not on what the
name of the fucking package said we
want to know the genetics that package
contained was it an
Afghan Columbian was it a
tie to a some
Melange was it a haze to a northern
light right because like today's
world everyone thinks haze is
NL5
so many people in the market don't understand
that it was a hybrid cross of
polyhybrid parents so haze isn't as
polyhybrid northern lights is a polyhybrid
so what came out of that
was seeds that were polyhybrids are not
true f1s they came out of a fucking
killer cross done
back in the 90s and everybody searching
different phenotypes out of you got the church
the piff the Frankie
you've got the pude you've got all
these different cuts
the cough they're all NL5
crosses but they are all passed off as
haze and none of them are pure
hazes so people start looking
for haze they dive in these and then they cross
them and they get these extreme
phenotype and genotype expressions
and then they're mad at the breeder
instead of understanding what's coming
out of there you're not going to get what you were looking for out
of a line that's six generations
past right if you take my
haze and try to cross it to someone else's NL5
it's not the same parental generation
so you're not going to get the same replication
which is what everybody's chasing that's
why they're going for skunk that's why everyone's trying to
do hazes now and
everyone hopped on the NL5
it's you can tell what generation
these people were in and what years they were smoking
by the plants they're trying to purchase
right the people smoking those
hazes from that time period and the NL5
are all smoking from between 1988
and 2002 there's
this period of time those plants were
being bred and passed around in
the catalogs you can read the catalogs
and see when they were offered to the public
that's when people started to purchase those
and they started to become widely available
the skunks get passed around
and get famous that skunk one
becomes famous once it hits
the scentsy seed bank and people are like
I can buy seeds at high times
and they started getting hip to that
a lot of people didn't want to buy the seeds
they were going to get busted they were afraid of it
and then they buy it your friend's uncle's
growing it in his basement it gets passed to some
cat who's now selling it in the house down the street
before you go to the big game
on the weekend
now everybody's got skunk from a different high school
or the first time they got high
and now they want to
replicate that and it's hard
to do unless you know the genetic basis of it
and the time period there was a skunk
that only had
two lines in it there's a skunk that had three
lines in it there's a skunk that's been back crossed
there's filial generations of skunk
all done and passed to different breeders
who worked on it
well see I'm glad
you said that because I
ended up
finding a
cultivar out
or I should say a pheno out
of the skyjar of
black lime reserve
cross I did and it
you know
it has zero
relation to skunk that I know
of and yet
it was when I was growing it at the time
it didn't necessarily
have super
skunky smell to
you know the nug
but man anytime I was within
15 feet
of that plant it was just like dude
there's like a skunk living
around here like it was
you know there
and I mean I driving
to work every day there's skunks
hit all the time and I feel like
there's different levels
of skunk because there's
skunk that you straddle
a fresh dead one and you want to
smoke because it smells like absolute
burnt tires chemicals and
just
disgusting and then there's
another level
of like you know it got
hit maybe on the side of the road something
it's a little further away and you're like
oh man like that smells like that
dank weed and
I feel like there's different
levels to skunk
because depending on
you know a freshly hit one
or the one that's been around
like there's
times where it's just I want to puke
right now and then other times
I'm like wow that smells like some of
the best weed I've ever smelled
and you know it's skunk because
you're in the middle of nowhere in hayfields
but
with that what I ended
up calling it Colorado roadkill
don't necessarily plan to
really release any of it
because I want to work it for myself
you know it's something everybody else is
looking for and I was able to find it
in genetics that are completely unrelated
to it
so it's definitely something I'm planning
to pursue and I'm already
looking through phenos I have a really
limey pheno right now it's nice
but probably not going to keep it around
because I need space to
you know find that skunky pheno
but I definitely feel like there's
that you know
it didn't net when I ran
the original F1 that I
had liked and
smoked on you know
it wasn't necessarily super
strong skunk right on
the nose as it was growing
it was you know you had to be away from it a little
bit and you're like wow that
there's a skunk like
living around here like it's right here
so yeah
I feel like a lot of people need to
stop chasing
the name of all these people saying
oh I got RSK
or
RKS and you know I have skunk
one or this that and the other because it's
like as we've all
heard there's a lot of berry
coming out of that and other
terpenes that we're not necessarily
looking for so I think people really
need to
go through other cultivars that they're
not necessarily expecting
skunk to come from because I mean
I wasn't expecting skunk
to come from Sky Jaro and
Black Lime Reserve that's for sure
Ryan I just saw
you jumped on and you posted a paper
that's actually about this
and it talks about
ironically skunk
and the
gelato lines and
some of the
that there
Hold on Trevor sorry I accidentally
muted you unmute yourself
Ah yes am I back
Yes cool
I was just introducing Ryan since
I saw him come up and that I know
he posted something about this
topic just recently so
and you also Ryan
knows the history of the skunk better
than most of us so
he can
you know drop in and give us
any insights
that he may know about that history
and you got to unmute yourself
I gotta hop off here
but I'm definitely going to continue listening
when I go back to work so
preach Ryan thank you
all for being here
and thank you Peter for having me on
We'll see you soon
Take it easy Lucas
Talk to you again brother
Take care man
So I know Ryan
has crappy internet
but
let's see if he
he's in the chat
Here let me
Trevor why don't you keep going and I'll try to
pull up his Instagram stuff
Yeah I was actually just
doing that I was going to pull up the paper
but yeah
a recent paper got published
that talks about
and it was interesting I think he posted it
the day after last week's
roundtable where we had
talked about the difficulty
of doing GC testing
on some of these styles because
of what minor
amounts they're in but
there's a paper that
actually talks about and characterizes
them in cannabis that he posted
Yeah I don't know
if you can hear me now
sounds like
yeah
yeah that paper
was I mean listen
when we look at again I gotta
set the preface right
scent is an orchestra
it's not one note like when you're
smelling you got your nose in a bag
you're smelling dozens
and dozens of dot hundreds of chemicals
all together
and it's
a combined effect that we perceive
it's really hard to train yourself it's not actually
that hard but
none of us or most of us
don't really have any experience in learning
the notes that make up
that symphony or the
instruments that make up
that symphony right so you can kind of think of all
the different chemicals that are found in a given scent
like
it's
just not natural like we don't have the opportunity
to go and learn those things all individually
on their own unless you're actually going and
buying the unique standard compounds
right and smelling them like on their own
whereas
like if you're listening to a symphony I mean you can
listen to an oboe or a saxophone
or a you know whatever
viola whatever instrument you can go and
find out what that smells like or sounds like
on your own but it's a little bit hard
it's a little bit harder with scent
um
but
anyway
you know when we break apart scents
we essentially use GC or something
like that right the GC is essentially like
a the description that I use to
people is like imagine you're
throwing a whole bunch of people down one of those big
water slides at the same time you know the ones that like
you go to a like kind of
they're built on a mountain side or whatever and they
kind of wind their way down
the GC is like
or the column in the GC is kind of like
the water slide and
as those compounds all travel down
through the column they get separated
by size
and their chemical characteristics with how
they interact with the inside of the tube
and that that separates
them like we do with bubble bags or
whatever like how we separate
resin glands by size
using like a series of cysts or
bubble bags or some kind of water hash extraction
system um so you
can kind of think of the context
as the same in those two
situations right and when
when the people or the compounds that are coming at the
bottom of that tube they go
through a detector and
you might have
like two compounds that are very similar
in size or chemical structure or whatever
that elute at the same time
so eluting means like when
we see like a compound come
at the bottom of the GC
when you're looking at a gas
chromatogram we see
these blips these kind of peaks that look like little
mountains going by
but the computer
whatever we're using to detect them they can't
separate like
if there's two molecules that come out
of the tube at the same time
the detector has a really hard time
separating those things
and so anyway
a lot of times using the chemical
analytical methods that we use to do
cannabis are pretty high throughput we're gonna miss
a lot of those little fine compounds
and these guys did some
special chemistry I think it was like called 2D
chromatography or whatever and there's
you know a lot better people like I'm gonna
actually invite up Dr. Mark Sheldon
cause he's in here and he is
um an absolutely how do I
bring him online can somebody bring him up online
Trevor can you do that Dr. Mark Sheldon
he is like one of the best chemists
in cannabis and he's super knowledgeable
on this stuff and can talk about these things
way way
better than I can
um
um can you bring him up Peter or
can you make me a moderator and I'll bring him up
but
anyway so they found this molecule
and this molecule is like
you can that molecule can be
present or absent in any given
terpene profile like remember it's not a terp
right it's another
class of molecule and again I'm gonna let
Mark um jump into the science
about it because he is just like
so much more educated and
fluent on the topic chemistry than I am
um but the idea
the point is that
you know this was found in
skunk a long time ago
um when David
initially started making these crosses back
in like the late 70s early 80s
and David selected away
from that but um
like Anthony was saying like those lines
got crossed into a whole bunch of different things
and renamed and
you know just think of it like a
trait like any other trait that gets like
bred through populations as you know
as you're making these crosses they end up
these chemicals end up in all these different places
so it's not really that
strange that we'd smell it in OG
um or we'd smell these compounds
and like OG's enchiladas and cookies
because they do you know
they are they are contributors to smell
and that's what we do
when we select plants like even the people that
don't know what they're doing right like
you grow some seeds you stick your nose in a bag
and you identify the one that is the funkiest
um
so yeah like it may seem like
these things are lost forever but that's just a story
that like when somebody said in the chat
like skunk is like a
chat room cultivar that's totally
nonsense like I've got seeds
there's seeds for sale on the
market that are like open pollinated
one generation removed from the skunk
crosses that were done in California
and so if you go through those things you can definitely
find it right
but anyway I want to introduce to you guys Dr.
Mark Sheldon he is like like I said before
he is one of the smartest
and most in-depth
chemists
in the space and
he's someone that really
we should you know I would defer to him
on a lot of these topics because he's just so
informed
oh my god
how do I follow up with that
uh well thank you can you guys hear me
yeah loud and clear
yes indeed
um yeah so these
are the thiols you're talking about
and they're sulfur containing
compounds that are extremely
um
uh fragrant
uh maybe not in a pleasant
way um
but uh the um
olfactory has basically developed
um a way of
detecting these
molecules in very very
um small quantities
I mean sub part per
billion you know part per trillion
regime and so like
it's kind of like the odorant that's used
in natural gas
which I believe is just butane thiol
which is only in there a few
parts per billion
I mean it's just amazing
that we could actually have
analytical instrumentation
to measure
um
uh compounds at such
a level and so what Ryan was
referring to is that
these things are not always
easily found and
they're fleeting and they also do
chemistry which makes things
very complicated because you're looking
at a mixture of compounds
uh that are in
some cases not stable when
they're isolated or heated
up in the presence of air
and they start thermally rearranging
or causing other reactions to
happen but um
these are at these particular
compounds these particular thiols
were actually detected in
hops many years ago
and they're basically
the uh elements
that create a skunkiness
to beer which I guess
uh traditionally they tried to
avoid but more
recently they're finding out that these
compounds again in very trace
amounts lead
to the overall flavor
profile that people
you know enjoy in
microbrews and um
sort of homemade beer
and other kinds of things but
these thiols are
basically somewhat
degradation products
um or
products that are basically found
in nature to
um basically alert
other animals like
the sort of the skunk spray
as to um where they should
be and where they shouldn't be
why cannabis variety
would evolve with
these compounds is
just you know
a real interesting
topic to consider because again
at very high concentrations
they're noxious and even
poisonous but in
low concentrations
they you know maybe cut
a little bit of the
fruitiness and
uh you know citrusy
fragrance to give a little bit of that
you know skunk smell
to some of the essence
and um
they're fleeting meaning that you
can um they could be
there one week and then not
their next just because
they've either evaporated or reacted
so um
it's a real um
uh challenge to
be able to preserve
uh not just the terpenes
but these other molecules that are
extremely fragrant and like
Ryan say add to the overall
flavor with the orchestra's
playing
that's Dr. Mark
Thank you for jumping on
Dr. Mark uh I appreciate
it and you know big fan of
you I remember
on the Adam Dunn show and you're
just being
a science oriented
person in the cannabis world
that's been on these shows and
helping us figure these things out
it's awesome
well it's yeah Adam
uh the Adam Dunn show that was a lot of fun
it's a lot of good memories
of that and certainly
um yeah lots of
platforms to do lots of
educating and that's why I know Ryan
and uh a lot of people
that we end up having these kinds of discussions
but so yeah these are great educational
forums
yeah
and also if people are
interested in um
there's a really good article
it's a paper
it's written by William Wood
um from the department
of chemistry at Humboldt State University
and it's the history of skunk
defensive secretion research
and it talks about
some of the difficulties they've had
with um
doing just basic research into
uh
the secretion
glands of skunks themselves
um to identify and figure
out what these different compounds are
and how early
um early researchers
had their labs completely
evacuated
and like essentially
got like fellow
staff and lab
co-lab people revolting
against them for trying to do skunk
research and so there's a
there's a long history of it and it's a pretty
interesting read
yeah well when Sam
talked about this on Hash Church yesterday
I think Marcus brought
it up and um
Sam did
confirm that they
measured these compounds way back
when in his
breeding work for skunk number
one and um
knew that they were the
compounds responsible for the
the skunkiness
or the muskiness of the odor
itself I mean there's definitely other
uh you know fragrant
uh notes in there like a gassiness
you know the gassiness of
the you know
skunk but certainly
the uh
there's no mistake in you know
when it almost smells like
somebody stepped in dog poo you know
it's like that smell
right there that's gotta be a sulfur
containing compound because
I don't think they make
carbon hydrogen and oxygen
containing compounds that smell like
that
yeah that's a very good point and a lot of the
um the funks that we
get are different sulfur based
uh
metabolic pathways that are producing
that and so having your sulfur
in your in your
nutrients and making sure
that you're producing enough of those precursors
is definitely important
if you want to have those funky terps
well that's an interesting
uh thing
Trevor I could bring up an anecdotal
um example of
you know sulfur powdered
sulfur which is used
uh I guess in some applications
and as a fungicide as a
topical fungicide
and even though it's inorganic
um it's
one of the only uh
uh I guess fungicides that's used
in organic farming which is really
interesting to interesting dichotomy there
but um
that sulfur can actually do
chemistry to cannabinoids
and people have seen this
I think if you heat up
sulfur in the presence of distillate
you could actually get a
disproportionation reaction that takes
you know sulfur will
oxidize THC up
to CBN
and it uh disproportionates
uh uh
the BMOs of THC down to
HHC
so this is kind of interesting because
about 3 or 4 years ago
we heard of some people
observing HHC in their
in their distillate
and I think that
the culprit there was
um elemental
sulfur contamination in the
distillate when they were heating it up
in that process
sorry that was a lot of chemistry
a breeding ring
no we like
that stuff yeah exactly
Mark
is also known as the hydrogenator
I don't know if you guys know of the
hexahydrogenated cannabinoids
but Mark's
the originator of those too
he's uh done some interesting stuff
with cannabis yeah we
we originated HHCA
HHC we have to give the credit
where credit belongs which is
Professor Roger Adams
you know that was back in
1940 when he first published that
and uh
then patented it
like 6 years later
so it's way off patent
so HHC was known for
a long time but when I did
a chemical
search for the structure HHCA
in January
of 2015 there were
no known hits
in the chemical
extracts database which was pretty
pretty interesting I didn't believe the
results of the search so I did it again
yeah it came up no known
hits so uh
we patented it you know almost
defensively just so
the big pharma industry
couldn't
Adams the Adams that
you're talking about for those that aren't
putting that piece together
it's Roger Adams right Mark
yeah Professor Roger Adams
and he was the first to isolate
CBD wasn't it?
that's correct first to isolate CBD
and really the first to almost
fully characterize THC
as we know the double
bond in THC is labile
so the methods he was using
was scrambling the position
of the double bond so it was confusing
him as to what the natural
configuration was which
was delta 9 which
Shulam figured out like
20 years after
after
Adams
his work but yeah Adams
was a powerhouse
in early cannabis chemistry and
published
15 papers in
less than a year and a half in the journal
the American Chemical Society on his
his work that they
you know developed from extracting
Minnesota wild hemp
and yeah the first
isolation of CBD he hydrogenated
CBD
hydrogenated THC
he did a lot of great work
and just
he was
the one who was
standing on his shoulders
Roger Adams and another guy named
Todd
but truth
be told the first people that isolated
THC I believe
was this group
that was at Cambridge
University in the 1890's
right so this is
contemporary with the discovery
of the light bulb okay
these guys were the first people that basically
make distillate and if
you read their paper and you look at the boiling
point of their distillate
it seems to be a pretty
spot on match for THC and
they thought they had isolated cannabinol
but I think that was an artifact
of how they were analyzing it
I think these were the first people that isolated
THC
before the turn of the last century
pretty amazing
20 years before
the discovery of the electron
to put it
in scientific context
10 years
before the rediscovery of Mendel's
work so yeah
that's super cool
how do you what gives you the idea
that when it was THC fraction
that they actually isolated did they do any kind of
dosing study or
if you look at their boiling point
so the boiling point of a pure compound
at a particular temperature
is consistent
and if you look at Michulam's
boiling point and you look at their
boiling point and you
plot it on something called a nomograph
which normalizes
different boiling points at different
temperatures to correct it for the
you know
standard pressure boiling point you'll see
that they both intersect
at about
429 degrees
centigrade
that's the boiling point
of THC
at sea level
and my own data I plotted
it over that too and yeah
at like
.0 or .5
I think we see a boiling point
of .85 and that's basically
pure THC
so the boiling point
is one thing you know and
actually how they
were doing the analysis right
which was really they were doing combustion
analysis right
so you figure and
you know even in the 1890s I mean
my gosh so they're taking a carbon
containing compound they're
combusting it and then
counting the amount of carbon
that's left behind char
or CO2
to determine what the molecular formula
is I mean imagine how accurate
you have to be in the laboratory
in the 1890s to be able to
even get close
on that kind of experiment and
these guys got real close
real close
but then a
professor from New Zealand
about 10 years later named
Sidney Kahn
figured out the correct formula
for THC and figured out the
correct formula for cannabinol
but I believe
that if you look at their boiling point
data and you look at the characterization
data
it's not easy to take
cannabis extract and convert it
into CBN that doesn't
just happen on distillation
and if you read their
paper you'll see
that they just you know extracted
and distilled it under vacuum
why would it be CBN
it's THC
you know so
their boiling point is
the key piece of experimental
data that you can
compare and say that yeah based on
the boiling point
these Brits were the first people to
bang out distillate
oh so they were probably using
what they were calling Indian hemp
back then in the day but it was
Charis yeah if you google
Woods, Bivy and Easterfield
and Charis you'll see a paper
published in
the journal of the chemical society
right because this was before the American
chemical society so the Brits thought
they were the
journal of the chemical
society right the world
the most advanced chemists in the world
right and so yeah
so they went over and
gathered up some Charis
and then put it into
a vacuum distillation
unit that they had back
in Cambridge and I
think I believe that
that Wood
who I think was a graduate student or
postdoc died in
a laboratory explosion
associated with doing this work I think
you can read something about that
on the internet a little bit after
this but this work which
was published in 1896
I think it is
cited highly by
Adams and
Kahn and really if you look
at Sidney Kahn so Sidney Kahn was the
guy who came along after Woods, Bivy
and Easterfield figured out
what the formula of THC was
they still didn't quite know the
structure although if you look at Kahn's
last paper he kind of pieces together
the structure but you know
they were still trying to figure out what chemical
structures were like this was like the 20s
and the 30s
and then yeah then Adams came
along and that was the guy who first made
HHC so we made HHCA
Adams made
HHC but these Brits I
think were the first guys to actually
isolate THC and distill it
for them
Charis for anyone that
doesn't know that's listening is
hand rub ash so it's rather
than being sifted off dry plant material
it's hand collected
by folks going up to cannabis plants
and just rubbing their hands so essentially these
Brits which you know back then was kind of the
area of like the William
O'Shaughnessy's era right post
Victorian England
where they you know they came to understand
that there was a medicinal value
for what they were calling Indian hemp
which was actually cannabis indica
right cannabis from India the drug
cannabis which was
kind of like really I guess right
around that time kind of being reintroduced
to the UK
yeah that paper by
O'Shaughnessy was really
the kind of the guiding
guiding light for
a lot of treatment of
maladies in the day and
you know you hear about Queen Victoria
and her menstrual cramps but
they're really if you read
in fact read Shaughnessy's paper
it's available on the internet it's totally cool
he treats dogs
he treats
all kinds of different people
and you know talks about how much he uses
how many grains of cannabis
you know oil and he talks about
his preparation and everything
so that's a really really neat paper
what's that from like the 1860's
right or something like that it's amazing
yeah I don't exactly remember the date but it's
pretty incredible to think that like
our entire set of
knowledge about cannabis has come around
in 150 years but really
in the last 50 years right I mean
and even in the last 10 years I mean look how many papers
are coming out every day with really new interesting stuff
cannabis is becoming one of the most
studied crop species
you know or at least most published on crop species
it's pretty incredible there's a lot
a lot of new discovery going on
especially
include cannabinoid research there because
then there's a lot of
you know more pharmacological
work and yeah just all
kinds of interesting stuff going
on and federal research
dollars funding grants right now it's
always interesting to go to NIH.gov
just to see like what they're funding
in cannabinoids today
that you know you wouldn't see that level
of funding previously
and you know
looking at psychedelics too which is
really exciting I think that intersection
between psychedelics and cannabinoids is
kind of where the new frontier
is.
Yeah it's definitely an area
where you know
most growers
that I've known over the
years who've been
heavily involved are all making
the transition to
different
be a cactus or mushroom
cultivation it's definitely exploding
and kind of becoming the
the new new.
I think there's a whole bunch of memes on that
Well I'm really excited
to see the testing labs
taking kind of like
the lead on developing
analytical testing
for the active
ingredients in mushrooms I mean I
had not familiarized
myself with what type of methods
are used for extraction
and analysis
of those but I know that there's a lot of people
a lot of smart people looking at that right now
and that's good.
In the chat earlier
there was a lot of discussion about haze and what
haze smells like
so I just I wanted to chirp in a little
bit on that. I think
a lot of the younger guys we
have
been a distorted appreciation
of what haze is because a lot of people
the haze that they've tried have been from Holland
so the kind of that Nel's haze
or the amnesia haze
like those families of seed plants
that came down that are altered patients
which is really not
the original haze what
original haze really was
a started as like a hybrid between
a couple of different equatorial
Anthony was saying three
but I'm not sure if it was three because it
was actually it wasn't even a project
it was just these two dudes that were growing equatorial
and in
like right near
moderate right near moderate
kind of area Santa Cruz zone
and and
they were I think it was just like just up on the
hill above Watsonville
but they were
they weren't saving clones back
then you got to remember and
they also weren't line breeding
so they'd make a hybrid one year you
know you have your females or the population
that you liked and the new the new stuff
that you collected came in either Colombian or
you know tire eventually like the
South Indians came in but they would
essentially sequentially add those new
lines in one at a time and
every year so he's changed every year
right it wasn't it wasn't like it was a
true red line that actually had any
kind of stability it was that you
had this like single cross hybrid
that became a triple cross and then it became
a double cross or
or sorry a four way cross
and and then it and then it inbred
right and so all
the all the when she started
breeding and you start you know you go through a couple
of crosses and then you start inbreeding
there is no way that you can
start inbreeding there is no
consistency you're just shuffling
all these different terpene profiles
my experience with those original ones is they're
more like limonene with
nothing really else or limonene and pinene
and nothing really else in the terp
profile and then
when they got over to Holland and Neville started
playing with you know David's
plants that he kind of didn't want to use
that's when
I don't know through what process it came out
but that's really when the terpenelene
came out and you know if you look
at like the sweet skunk or even like the
the RCC the Roberts Creek
Congo which I
have a hard time calling that because I've always just
known it as the Congo there's a little
bit of terpenelene in there but it's
and if you go back to some of these old lines
there's like there's hints of that
smell but what became
like the you know the quote unquote
Dutch hazes is really
when terpenelene jumped up and became predominant
and like in that amnesia
kind of nose right
which you know it probably
came from a similar pool as the train wreck because
train wreck has got that same kind of
scent profile to it and
the descendants you know Jack and everything
else Jack is again like
being a polyhybrid like you have some
individuals that are terpenelene dominant but you got
all these other weird scents in there too because it
was like a three way cross of
you know skunk northern lights and haze or whatever
so there's a lot of influence in there that
was not really hazy even though there
is a little bit of a haze nose on the probably
the best plants that are in those populations
but anyway
just something to keep in mind when you're thinking about what
when we're talking about what
these scents are because again like I think
we all
get biased because we've all
we've all smelled
one individual that was like you
know a segregated plant from that
population but again because those plants
were so heterogeneous with all
these different types in there
what became popular or known as
haze in one area isn't necessarily
going to be the same scent
as what became popular in another area
sorry for going on. Oh my god
Ryan I just gotta say I so
appreciate you because I literally had
almost that exact mirrored conversation
and those exact genetics brought up
just last night so you're making
me feel way better like I'm like oh I
could actually I do know what
I'm talking about because you just laid it all out
exactly and how it was even with the
train wreck piece and all these other pieces
because I feel like it's
this very it's like a such a nuanced
thing that I feel like people don't fully understand
and then also I
want some of those flavors and I can't
really find them right now and it's like
and also some of these things aren't so popular
for people to grow and
I'm just really curious like who
actually even has those things right now
because it's it's kind of like
they get outdated and I was
really like there's like a craving and I
maybe comes from last week's conversation
around the hazes where I'm like I want
that now
I was gonna agree with Ryan
there with the hazes as they came to America
here and were bred in that area they
went from the Colombian
to having a Corella Indian
influence added to it and also
a Thai Corella influence
added to it so it
goes back down to like I was talking earlier
with the skunks which one did you get
can you track it through there
that's why I share the story
with the haze that I've reproduced through
seed form so that people can
track history of the line
and understand what
is in there so if people
buy it and think they're getting specific
terpene profiles like Ryan
brought up here like everyone thinks haze
is jack or everyone thinks Cindy 99
is haze right they all have specific
ideas of what haze is
and mostly they just have
a haze in the
cross somewhere it doesn't make them hazy
anything haze can come
from all kinds of different
directions when you're breeding with it
the out crosses the F2s the
Cib crosses you're going to get all kinds
of different profiles out of those
plants and when people
start bringing up like
that hazy terpene and
that hazy structure
I always ask them how many of you
ever grew haze like really grew
just haze I've
worked with haze since 96 and even then
that's not even going back far
enough but the first plant I ever bred
with was haze and
I've done it again there's other breeders out there
buy some haze seeds
and do like Bam did do a very large population
of hazes and see what's in that line
you'll notice that you're going
to have to pick cultivars to line breed
in those directions it's heterozygous
with most of the traits on the line because it wasn't
bred to be true it was
just bred to produce seed stock
so they could continue growing it
year after year like I said they didn't
take clones of these lines they weren't going to
house all these plants especially the hazes
if you've seen haze grow
how many people
were really rocking a large enough area
to put a ton of these
plants indoors somewhere and hold them
they get very very large
very quickly they have a metabolism
that outpaces many other plants that
most people have been growing they go crazy
yeah
if I may just real quick
listen I didn't
this information was passed to me from David
it's not some truth discovery that I've
come on I mean I figured out the terpeneline
the terpeneline
train wreck thing
on our own through the lab where we did in California
but
you know I know these things
to be true because this is what David told me
how they did them and
he took me to meet the haze brothers one day
and unfortunately it just didn't work out
because of the situation
they had
they had a business the one guy that we were going to
meet had a business that got
occupied that day and we just couldn't run into him
but
I'm just sharing you the history of what was
there from the people at the time
but yeah that is definitely the way that the haze lines
were bred and everything
that Tony is saying is absolutely true
this is something I think other breeders
should do with the lines they're passing
the line with the plant if you have it
don't just pass those pretty pictures
let people pass the facts
so we don't end up with all this
misinformation on what something is
or pass who the breeder was
where the source came from like the
Congo Ryan's talking about
how it tracks back through
different breeders and how it got to the
market that it's in where you're at
like how I received it
how it got bred to the position
it's at if you know those things
pass it with the plant and we
end up with less convoluted
information out there for all the new people
coming in and for the people that are trying
to research the plant because like I said all this
research that's coming they need to have
information of the cultivars that
we're using that way they'll be
able to trace anything that they
want to come out of it like 10 different
people put congos in there and
they all show up different when
they do testing on them then
we're kind of screwed
so if we can
just pass the facts with a single cultivar
put that in a library
somewhere it'd be easy to go into that library
for breeders to pull out what they're
specifically looking for terpene profiles
thiols esters
alcohol whatever it is you're after
if we can have verifiable
cultivars that are banked
somewhere or pollen
storage of cultivars that we know
offer these traits we'd
all be in a better position
yeah and there's tons of
context in there right like there's knowledge
buried in the context of those
hybrid states like when I get
a seed line and I know it's like a
true breeding line or an IBL
versus if something is a self
cross or if something is a sib cross
or if it's an F1 hybrid like
I'm going to make different breeding decisions
or choices
or even adjust my expectations
about what to expect
from out of there I mean you were talking Tony earlier about
you know 10 seeds and going digging down on the line
I mean
in the context I disagree with that a little bit because I
kind of think that the breeders should be making
those traits come out in the
seeds that they're selling like I would hope
that they do at least but
the truth is you gotta know
you know if something is an F1
and you don't have the scent that
you're expecting especially you know as we move forward
and we get away from people talking about
like citrusy or cushy
or these like really
not very informative descriptor
words that we use
and we all start speaking the same terp language
or the same volatiles language
where we're saying oh yeah here's an analysis
of this plant and it does have
the 321 MBT in it you know
you can start
making better decisions about how to go
like what type
of crosses you want to make
to reinforce those traits I mean
if it's an inbreeding line
you know you might not have a lot
a high degree of heritability
of that trait right because it's like it might be
fixed in the line but if it's an F1
hybrid or a self for example
you know you look through those populations in a different
way because you know
like especially in the case of a self cross
that you're going
as a breeder you're essentially going through
or not even as I guess as a breeder
or such researcher if someone's trying to figure out
the heritability
of a trait like 321 MBT
you know
we need to figure out
like is it dominant is it recessive
just having one copy is one
copy different from two copies is it
like you know is it gene or interaction
by two different genes like
there's all this stuff that we can learn about
in the context that we can draw
from understanding the
context in which those crosses are made
right and especially
with this fucking weird you know
this weird
this weird kind of like understanding
that people have of what a strain
is right like it's like a you know
they think that it's like you take a plant and you cross
it you know like for example
Blue Dream right we got a clone that's called Blue Dream
and if you take that
you cross yourself
the name that goes on the
bag of seeds that comes from that cross
shouldn't be Blue Dream
right because none of like very few
of the plants in that self one generation
are going to look like the parent
plant right
and so I don't know
if they're making an S1 from that plant isn't it
basically just a feminized F2
version of what you made
you just used two different
or two parents they just happen to be Blue Dream
they're the new P1's
but it's you're inbreeding it on itself
would that not be an F2
version of the
of what's available? Yeah it's like an
F2 it's what that's really called is a
segregating generation right
so an F2 is a segregating generation
where you start to get that reshuffling and an S1
behaves like
an inbred F1
or an F2 generation but the
real term for that is called a segregating
generation and it's just when we see
you know it's the
shuffle generation right it's when you
repair up the alleles in
combinations that weren't necessarily found
in P1 and P2
so
most of the people will think they would take that
Blue Dream and reverse it now they
have a complete copy of the
Blue Dream instead of understanding what happened
is each clone even though they were
of the same parent passed
half of its genes
in the cross and there was no way
for us through regular breeding to
ensure that we passed the exact
same copies so that we
lined up the DNA
the exact way that that
Blue Dream passed it in its
original version. When people start
passing cuts of that around and start telling
everyone now they have Blue Dream and
now they've screwed up the whole
clone market with that
the breeding that could come from it because
that's what screwed up so much
things with people naming stuff the same
passing cuts of a plant
that came from an S1 generation
I say the same thing you said you
should always
give it a different name or
make sure that you
write down on there that it is a
original version of that plant so
people won't pass it as the same thing
it's just messing us all up
We're naming
it 28 different things
you know like
that's the other issue that we're seeing
so much across the board is just people
renaming you know specific
cultivars with different things
all across the board and
it's just kind of a hot mess
at this point to be honest
Yeah well that's
to me it comes down to
it's really kind of an
example of why I think pedigree selection in
cannabis is really like a stupid way to breed
cannabis right like
you're saying Anthony like when you're
segregating F2 type generations
you can have two distinct
plants that came from the same cross
that are nothing even remotely like
right like they're completely different
in every regard
Yep
That's what lion breeding to go two different directions
from the exact same gene pool
Yeah exactly
right but like pedigree selection
is kind of based on like if you
think about where it's used most like I
think about it really in the
context of it's usually more
for inbreeding species in the plant world but
for like for example the way they use it in the animal world
I mean it's like you know
in dog showing or in like
horse breeding right like
if you get a horse that's like really fast or
a strong stud or whatever
people you know people
are drawn towards the offspring of
that plant of that horse because
they think in terms of
yeah like this you know this plant
came from you know he was this
sorry this horse was sired by
whatever Joe the Thunder
whatever
I'm getting a good name for a horse
but like you know
Thunder Breather or whatever right like
the idea
is that like that horse really probably only
had like less than 10 offspring
right and so
it makes sense to use pedigree selection
because you can kind
of say okay 1
out of 10 or by choosing
one of those 10 offspring
we're hoping
that that horse
has the traits that the parent had
but you know
in the context of a segregating cannabis
population
the filial relationship like the fact that
two brothers or two sisters
siblings came from the same
seed lot like if they look nothing
like it's kind of fucking really uninformative
right like there's nothing
that really that is really
like solid info that's being passed
that you're learning
about being able to take an outcross
plant and use pedigree selection
like just the fact that it's a daughter
or a sister of you know
Cup Winter X doesn't really mean anything
right in fact it probably means
nothing
and so anyway I'm like
and I kind of learned this you know
I did a few plant breeding courses when I was in
university and I remember one of the profs saying like
yeah pedigree selection is something that you
use for inbreeding crops but it's not you
wouldn't use that for outbreeding crops
and it's always just kind of
it always just kind of like
it just sat wrong with me
like it's like the same idea that I mean
people can probably that aren't plant breeders
probably think about it in this kind of like
crass analogy that I use
it's like imagine saying like
if you cross a black person with a Chinese person
everybody's gonna come out
like everybody in that cross is gonna come out like Tiger Woods
right and it's just
and that's just not true
like there's absolutely not true
and so when I see people like
saying oh go back and remake
the same cross to try and get
to the same goal that's not
a good way to do it right
you don't like just because you cross
to a blueberry to a haze doesn't mean that you're
gonna come up with blue dream in fact like you're really
not gonna come up with blue dream
so you know
anyway I think there's better ways
to go about doing these things
and as a community we've
really fallen into
a lot of bad habits
and major major
major assumptions that we make about the
way that the plant breeds that are just so
far off base
that like you know
I feel like we reset
these rooms in here it's like we kind of need to reset
everybody in the breeding world
and be like okay guys let's all
get on the same page understand
the whole thing from DNA upwards
and then get back to work because
it's like in many ways a lot of
us are just spinning our tails
right and all the plants are just coming
up like gas gas gas all over the place
and listen I love gas it's I'm not saying
let's not do gas but it's like
does everybody need to only do gas
you know there's so much more to cannabis than that
the consumers
that are losing out at the end of the day I'm sorry
Anthony I'll let you go ahead I just wanted to
I just want to say I think I brought this up
last week and actually Ryan you
came up like this came up to me with Trevor
because of some of like a lot of the stuff that
Trevor's been posting lately and
then I was
speaking with another plant scientist
and IP lawyer and just
like I feel like
I thought of you Ryan because I feel
like there's different
people are doing different styles of
breeding and the things like
there maybe does need to be some sort of reset
you know all of these different things
across the board is if we can like
maybe classify it like that like we have
you know different type one type two
type three cannabis we're gonna etc
but we could have like also these different
categories of breeding but maybe there's some
like baselines that
we're you know we can all agree on
or and there's seed production
versus actual breeding
and so it's kind of a complicated
thing I think we're not all doing the
same thing I guess is what I'm realizing
Anthony can I just jump
in real quick just just kind of on the topic
I forgot to push me
you know I
totally agree with what you're saying Evian
and
again also
reinforcing what Anthony said before
about disclosing
the information like tell people
what the parents were
tell people the origin
of those seed lines
tell people the type of
cross that you did you know was it a self
was it a sib cross was it a back cross
like because again there's information
there's knowledge in all of
those things that are going to inform
the people and it doesn't
apply as much to growers that are just taking the seeds
and growing them that doesn't really matter but for
the people that are going to take remember we're custodians
right like you know
I kind of say to people it's like
they ask me like what are you going to work on next or what's the next
thing it's like look I've only got so many years
on this rock like I'm 40 you know mid
40s now so I've probably got
say 30 35 years left
and there's only so much work that I can do in that
time and guaranteed none
of the projects that I'm really going to start are going to
be finished by that time like I
see plant breeding is something that goes on and
on and on no matter what there's always improvements
to be made and so
we have a duty to
the species and the people that are
going to come along and take the work that we've
started and continue with it
by being able to provide them as much information
as possible so that when
they it's their time to make
decisions they're informed
decision makers right and I
you know we don't listen we
all do this because we love what we're doing
sure there's people
in the business that are only doing it for money
but I
think the work that's truly going to
stand the test of time
is done by the
people that love it and so
you know
part of that it's
like a labor of love and I think that like part
of our duty is to you know we have
a duty to inform the next people to come along
which is why good documentation
and
not hiding what
the work that you've done or trying
to misrepresent the work that you've done because
essentially you're just you're really
the one that you're hurting
is cannabis right
in the end so
you know again like just
reiterating what you said Anthony about
about
about disclosure right and then being
honest about what your work was and what you did
yeah I say the
same thing I want to say something
to everybody here so they get a visual representation
of reading
and trying to get the same thing
from every seed and what you're going to get from that
cross go look at the octomom
and all her children
same parents
she's got 14 children not a single one of them
look a damn alike or will they breed
anything alike their children aren't going to look
alike they don't look alike they all
you
it's a way for folks to visualize what's
actually happening in a pair of seeds every
seed on that plant is its own
genotype for it what's
inside of it and it has its own
genotypic expressions
so we have to try to educate
people I don't know if it goes from the baseline
or the breeder I believe we need to start at the breeder
side somehow we need to put
some kind of education form together
where we as breeders
can agree on something
so that when we're passing information
the folks that
want to learn are learning
some correct baseline so that
we can jump forward faster than we've been
doing I mean we've been on this one
way of reading for so
long in the cannabis community let's make as much
TSC as we can
let's try to get as much money as we can
from it when we do it and
let's hoard it when we have it
instead of doing like other
people were doing any other breeding
of plants they would share their novel
idea somewhere
some form to make sure that the
genetic code is saved that germ class is what's
important it's
not who
who's holding it we've got to get
over that in the cannabis community
Anthony you say
a very good point bringing up octamom
and I just want to remind us that
this goes above horticulture you guys
these are plant teachers and
every living thing that comes
on this planet every single one
that we bring life to comes in with
a new spirit okay regardless
of what the DNA is regardless of
what the life history
and genetic DNA is
on this planet it's going to have
its own spirit and its own
soul so just don't forget that part
even though we might not be able to prove it through science
clearly yet you know every
single time you bring a new plant into life
it's going to have its own spirit
100% well said
100% I get so
much out of these talks you guys are
I love this community you guys are
great Ryan
you were speaking on the
plants being different than
dogs or horses
or something could you maybe speak
on that a little bit more it's obviously there
from a different kingdom but you know
it's just a really interesting perspective
I would love for you to maybe explain on that
a bit more if you could
yeah so
I mean it really comes down to this
topic of inbreeders versus
obligate outcrossers
right so
tomato arabidopsis
all these other plants that like
most flower crops like
most
plants that are perfect flowers so
you know plants that have stamens and pistils
on them which is the vast
majority of flower types
they're typically inbreeding species
and
there's a whole bunch of consequences that
come around with being an inbreeding
species. Inbreeding species if you have genetic
defects you end up with a big problem
or not a big problem but you end up with
those plants that have
the
the plants that inherit the weak genes
they have a real problem because they're a real
disadvantage and so
inbreeding species are like
they're kind of locked into a specific
geographic pattern like they're
not geographic pattern, geographic
or environmental
climb like a location
and if you
move that plant population
to somewhere with a totally different environment
they don't really do very well in fact a lot of times
they won't even colonize the new environment
because they're so specialized
for that one area
right or that one area and the environment
that it has
that comes along with it
Cannabis is a lot
more like humans right so
as we know I mean aside
from the blue bloods aside from the royal
families all over the world we don't
breed within our family
right like we breed
outside of our family and that's like
it's a custom but there's
a reason that it's a custom
we probably
we probably did that
no it's all good we probably did that
at one point in time right like
in fact surely we did like you know
in the human history there was some inbreeding going
on people were
marrying or not marrying they were having
kids with people
in their close tribe
and pretty quickly we learned
that that's not the right thing to do
because again
because we're
obligate out crossers so what does obligate out crosser
mean? Obligate means that like
you're obligated to
like we can't you can't none of us
in this room fingers
crossed can self fertilize right like
we can't have offspring by fucking
ourselves right you
have to have another individual
or someone else of the same species
and of the opposite sex
in order to
create progeny and
that
that's by definition what an obligate
out crosser is. Cannabis is the same way
naturally in the field
okay
plants typically in
in the wild don't self
fertilize. Cannabis plants in the wild typically don't
self fertilize you know
you get a stand grown a whole bunch
of males and a whole bunch of females and it's essentially
this big like wild
kind of gangbang kind of thing where it's
like all the females all the males are fertilizing
all the females and
just shuffling all the different
potential genetic combinations
possible
and one of the consequences of that
is that anytime there's a
mutation in
the DNA that
might change a gene or change
you know it might change a gene that changes
a phenotype
that sticks around
those things don't get purged
out of the population they just
might be buried in the genome
you might never see it because it's a
recessive condition
but when two of those alleles
happen to come back together
in a random breeding event then you see the
phenotype that is associated with that
inbreeding state so
I don't know if I'm doing a very good job of explaining
what your question is there one love but
yeah
kind of see you going with it
and see it on a better scale on
like a out you know a
land race for you know like that open
breeding kind of scale
I can see that thank you yeah and so
like a land race is a great way to look at it right
because a land race is kind of one step
removed from a wild population
the really the definition of a land
land race is
a population of an animal or
a plant that's bred by
a culture in a specific area
right and so the one that
I always go to that kind of comes to mind
for me is like that the tie with the
tiny stringy little buds and the
you know
that that was like
there was a whole culture of people within
Thailand that like farmed and
produced and processed those types
of flowers into tie sticks
and that phenotype
of the plant
was really selected by
the cultural use of that plant
right and so that was by
definition a land race but the other thing that we
one of the things that
part of the definition of a land race
is that land races are
they're called
heterogeneous populations
of heterozygous
which just means
that yeah although they do follow
a type for the traits that were under
selection by the
culture
the rest of the traits vary
and the reason the rest of those traits vary
is again because cannabis is an out crosser
and we haven't purged them but the
reason that's beneficial to a land race
is because even in a given culture
and a specific location
environment does change
from year to year
right and so
having all that genetic variability
in the traits not under selection
by the culture allows
for the species to cope
with the changes in the environment
and anyway
it's
kind of academic
but it really does make the
basis
for an understanding of what plant breeders
or what we as cannabis plant breeders are trying to do
right like
if we knew that you could cross a plant
and all the offspring would come out looking the same because
the plants were so
genetically similar
you'd want to have that expectation
but just like we also want to have the understanding
that cannabis is so hyper
variable not only in phenotype but genotype
because all of these
genetic variants
are kept around
again because it's an
obligate out crosser I can't say that enough
that really has
to inform our strategy
for breeding right like we have to really
understand that and if you don't have an
understanding
of cannabis being an obligate out crosser
you're going to make a lot of mistakes as a breeder
because your
expectations are going to be so far out of whack
right like we have to know
that
a lot of the beneficial types
that we see are because of this
heterozygotic
state that the plants are in
right
which again leads back to the conversation Trevor
where we were talking about pure line selection
right so
yeah no I was just
kind of thinking about and wanted to chime
in on
sort of an example
that I think kind of
bridges these two points
Neville
did pedigree selection
he was very
avid pedigree
selection breeder he did he had a background
in animal plant or animal
breeding before he got into cannabis breeding
and
you can see
particularly with his Hay's work
where he had the A and the C
males there's an intensive
bottleneck that gets created
when you're doing these one to one
pedigree selection very
intensive
relatively small
populations because he was
he said that he was working with
about 50 plants at a particular
time from
a population and doing his selections
from about that range
about 50 plants even though he said that
over time he went through about a thousand
of some of the different
things that he selected from
but in a given
population given seed pop
he would do about 50 plants
select for the
best out of that
and he did
very small limited
scale selection that was all based on
pedigree breeding and so a lot
of the bottleneck that we see that
comes from the Hay's that are
sort of the Dutch Hay's gene pool
are
directly related to that breeding
strategy and using pedigree
breeding for populations that
is as
Ryan's been talking about an Obligan
Outcross species it has
a very heterozygous very
wide gene pool and
so when you just do those very
intensive individual selections and then
you add inbreeding on top of it
you're going to go down very narrow pathways
and get some pretty intensive bottlenecking
and you're also
while you can get
extreme phenotypes and you can get
trait gain
as a result of that type of intensive
selection it's
much more difficult to do
large scale
population breeding and
actually breed for quantitative
traits and not
lose the diversity
so if you want to
be able to have different
terp profiles than just a
terp hyaline terp profile
you want to be able to do more of that
mass selection where you're selecting
it like a threshold
of a percentage of a population
inbreeding with a larger
grouping of X males
to X females that
are demonstrating the traits that you're
breeding for at
a certain
threshold or percentage of the population
that are
ideally the best expression for
that particular trait
and by doing that you're going to
particularly with a
species like cannabis you're going
to be able to move the population
the mean for the particular
trait under selection without
causing that enormous bottleneck that
you're going to get or did get with
some of the Dutch breeding that happened back
in the day. Just that's
kind of my way of thinking or
like conceptualizing
what just got
discussed. I don't know if that helped.
I appreciate
you saying that Ryan about how
heterozygous landrace
cannabis is. Everybody that
I see out there is under the
assumption that if they just get their hands on these
landrace lines that have been bred by farmers
by
cultivating seed stock
that they're going to get these true breeding
lines from these
genotypes. A lot of people
also believe that these landraces
are the wild ecotypes
which are the baselines of what they believe
all our cannabis today came
from. There's far too many people
confusing them and getting people to
purchase seed stock based on these confusions.
Yeah well
whenever I hear someone raving
about the benefits of landraces
I can see someone that has never grown
them. Because if you've ever grown
a landrace you can actually see how
shitty they are overall compared to modern hybrids.
You might find some interesting
things in there but you're certainly not going to grow them for
commercial purposes.
Not from seed.
That's so true. Oh my god.
That's what the
markets for. You find that cultivar
out of all those and then run it through there.
But again it goes back
to educating the breeder. Far too many breeders
believe that they're
giving people the whole
genotype from passing one male
to one female from some seeds some guy
told them they got from Afghanistan
while they were in there for two weeks.
How long were you smoking
weed while you were there?
Did you have any cultural
contact with anyone besides some
people that gave you the seeds at the bus stop?
How do you know
what you have is anywhere near
the wild form of
any Afghani?
So many people pass on any
plant that they're claiming is a land
or it's just crazy
what I see out there.
Like if they can confuse
an NL5 haze with a haze
I'm pretty sure they can confuse a
pure Afghani with maybe
some other
cultivar that someone
just claimed was an Afghani.
If they've never grown either one how
do people out here recognize that?
That's a question I've always wanted to
ask folks but no one ever
seems to answer it.
Yeah, that
also sort of dovetails with the
misconception that
people have around the terminology
P1 as if
P1 is magically just
some true breeding pure
strain. It's only a
true breeding pure cultivar
if you've actually
got a true breeding pure cultivar
and just getting some sort of land
race like you're saying Tony
is not sufficient for
having quote unquote
true breeding genetics.
Funnily
enough, I mean Trevor we're going to cover
this in our show but
P1, like when we hear people
talk about P1s, there's no such thing as
P1s. There's P1 and P2
right? Parental 1 and parental
2. And somehow in the cannabis
world they call it, like we always
hear people talk about it, talking
about the P1 generation and that's
just kind of nonsense, right?
Brian, have you heard anything
about the P0 generation?
I've seen
online stuff about it but nothing
in any kind of talk
like real educational format
like the original stock
I guess it would be the ecotype
the wild ecotype as being
P0 generation.
P0? Like P as in
Peter or T as in Tom?
P as in Peter. Like parental
originator there's a
P0 instead of P1
because P1 can just be any
two plants, P1 and P2
whichever parents you pick
the pollen donor and the
one that is receiving the pollen.
I was just wondering if anyone else
had heard of that? I've never heard it.
What I would assume that someone's meaning is
like the P0 generation
is the family
the plants were taken from. P1
might be
the individual selected cultivar
from that generation perhaps.
But you know in the
like for example in the regular plant
breeding world you talk about like P1 cross
P2 and then when you're doing
a back cross like you might have like
BC1,2 right?
Which means your first back cross
to P2.
To the second parent.
Exactly.
That reoccurring parent.
Yeah and so you might do
you might do you know
BC1,1 or BC1,2
like you do a back cross to the mom or the
back cross to the pollen donor right?
That was one of those you know
it's funny like at some point
in time someone needs to write a book
about all the stupid things that cannabis people
decided to try to rewrite the world
rather than just learn the way that the rest
of the world does it right?
We should call it Trolling the Trolls.
Totally.
I um we mentioned
and we're going to look into the paper
soon
with Chad Westport but
for years
everybody called it genetic drift
and if you knew
what genetic drift was
in like population genetics you're like
that's not what
that is and then
there's actually a term for it
genetic mosaicism
and had we just known that term
decades of
going to like scientists and
saying a word
and then being told uh
that's not a thing
you know we would have actually
gotten somewhere instead of just being
like yeah stupid
stoners.
I think Ryan
sorry Ryan you brought it up on the
conversation with Shango too
and that was like really cool to hear you
kind of like actually lay it down there
as far as what it actually is.
I really I think that's so true I think we actually
should have like a maybe we should make
like a I don't know like a
cheat sheet like actual scientific
terms for like
bro science or something or
like the difference or what the crossover.
As a
university employed horticulturist
and somebody who sits on the American Society
of Horticultural Scientists as well
trust me this is a
continuing conversation you have
no idea how much I have to translate
cannabis for the horticulturist
and normally when I do
peer-reviewed documents I'm putting in a glossary
that puts these terms in there because
they're not they're not concurrent with the
horticultural industry and
I definitely I agree I think
it's special for us to
and important for us to try
to make this you know in a
universal language.
Yeah well
again it's like
rather than learning cannabis
we're breeding from plant
breeding textbooks people learn
cannabis breeding from
you know cannabis websites
and all the cannabis websites
are wrong or the vast majority of them are wrong.
You know the community
has kind of adopted this like completely
incorrect set of
set of conversations
sorry
someone in the chat Magnum Opus is saying
no one says genetic drift anymore. No
what we're pointing out is that genetic
drift has a meaning
that is different
from the way that it's used in the cannabis world
and the word
the definition
sorry the word that defines
what people mean by genetic drift is
genetic mosaicism as
sorry Mark's just saying goodbye
take it easy Mark
yeah the
we just for some reason
we adopted this wrong set of terminology
genetic drift really means the change in
genetic frequencies of
sorry the change in allelic frequencies
from one generation to the next
and that you know that kind of
is based off a concept that we have
that they used to teach genetic concepts
in university or even high school
I guess maybe but it's kind of
the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium
and the Hardy-Weinberg
equilibrium essentially says that like
the frequency of genes in a population
shouldn't change
if the population is large enough
meaning
you know you've got enough individuals
breeding and then also that there's
no gene flow into
the population so as soon as you have
like gene flow into the population you
have like a new genetic contributor
coming into the population
he's going to be he or she is going to be
adding new sets of traits that
didn't exist in the population
that changes the frequencies of the
alleles in future generations
that's genetic drift
what people have
drifted away from the baseline of the gene type
exactly the genotypes
change in the population and again
these are all going to remember this is like on a
population level
but what the cannabis community has decided
that genetic drift means is
when one plant phenotypically
changes over its lifetime like say
you know for example some of these plants that have been around
for like 10, 20, 30 years
that they might change
you know for example a plant acquires HLVD
right it's got the hop
latent viroid it picks up a
different phenotype well before
we knew about viroids
people would just assume that that was like genetic drift
oh the plant has accumulated or what
they call genetic drift the plant
has accumulated a mutation that
results in a different phenotype
but that's not what genetic drift means
that's genetic mosaicism
so there's a
genetic mosaicism just means that there's a
mosaic of genetics within a given plant
right
so that's just one
small example
of words that the cannabis community has
like redefined
in our foolishness
and
and
in our foolishness
rather than try to just like
learn and understand what the rest of the world
uses I mean again it's kind of
understandable because
because of prohibition cannabis has been so
sequestered from the rest of the plant world
but now
it's kind of like
we've got this like version
of our own language and when we go back
out and try to integrate and talk
to like Marissa was saying people from like
these horticultural societies
they look at us like we're idiots because we use
words that don't mean what
they mean right where we use them
we've essentially given new definitions
to these words and we use them that way and
that's like that's not a very good way
to be dealing with the rest of the world right
or trying to engage with the rest of the world that does
this work
the same goes
for like even how we do products and
things like because of you know I have a background
in herbalism as well and like you
know it's like growing all sorts of different
things the language that we've taken
but like you know even in cannabis
products it's like we're calling things tinctures
that actually aren't even remotely
close that's like it's like we've created a whole
subsect and we've like absconded with
language and switched it around
and I think we really need to kind of get our lexicon
and nomenclature especially
as we are bringing more science
and data and these things to the table
and we're able to actually do more research
now I think it's incredibly important that
you know kind of like a united
lexicon because it really applies
to you know
regulations and legislation and other
things as we come down the pipe and
when you're looking at you know now we're
you know actually certifying seed
for type 3 cannabis
with you know with ayahuasca
and like these other things so it's definitely
you know I think that we
need to come with
collective language that is
unified and actually
using real science
yeah no I definitely
agree and I think that it's
a good point that like we
a place where we
were sort of cut off from
these institutions and didn't
necessarily have
access to all of
the academic
institutions that could support
us and or like
I even remember going
reaching out to UC Davis extensions
and different UC Davis
like pest management
or insect
specialists and sometimes
the interface was
really you know
good and usually
it was with professors who had
very long tenure
and gave zero fucks about anything
and were interested in
cannabis and were down to just talk with people
who were interested in stuff even if we didn't
really know the
all the
specifics about what we were talking about
literally not even knowing what a broad
mite or a russet mite was and
getting those identified for the first
time and
then other times
having just like full stone
wall you know
can't talk about it because of
the funding and
like uptightness of the
university space so I feel
like now that we've got access
and a lot of these barriers are breaking
down yeah we
need to really you know
take advantage of it and
acquaint ourselves
with the literature and the information
a lot of that Trevor is
sorry
a lot of that Trevor is still
true I just had a
tenure professor above me retire
this weekend at University of Nevada
and we are
uncertain at this point in time
as far as how the cannabis program will continue
after we have a new professor and it's all about
stigma and it's all about you know
holding our ground and trying
to stand up and say hey this is what
we are doing and this is how we are moving
forward but we have no guarantee even that
Nevada will continue with research
because we're losing
some tenure professors that
had this under their belt as
something they really wanted to do and I don't know
how new blood is going to work because
ultimately we still can't get the
funding. Evian and I
are having a conversation
offline right now because
for example this week
I work for multiple universities
and the one university where I do have trials
with
I've been talking all year
with my professors and explaining to
them hey when it comes time to test
we have to have funding in line and everything
else and even the university system
I can't get funding approved
I can't print anything
with the words hemp on it that
go through a certain part of our printing division
because it's all federally funded I can only
print it from my
hemp account and
things like that are still
we still have the federal
versus state versus
the full picture
here is not
it's still cannabis is still
cannabis and we're still dealing with that stigma
and yeah I mean it's
it's a gamble every day
I think there's new blood coming in right now
that's definitely for it but we
still have a lot of old blood in the system
that's against it and they
don't want to see somebody federally
folding and they want to stand
by the fact that hey it still is federally
legal and we want to prove
it and I think that's just a lot of big hold
of pharma and things like that that
we're still under that
thumb but we're getting there
we're getting there. It's like the
death rattle of the post prohibition
era thinking and we're kind of like
still in that and you can see it kind of
run rampant through the whole industry
even from like our banking and other
things and I think that like
what we're dealing with with the breeding
side and like it's like coming I think
that there's this coming together with
I've learned so much I'm so
blessed I feel like to have worked with so many
people who have come from traditional
ag because I feel like it's like
we have a lot to learn
and I really appreciate
Trevor and Ryan and the information
that you guys have been sharing and
you know I would really love to see more people
like actually reading white papers and
discussing them I think that we're kind of coming
into a different era where we're
not having to look to other
countries like Israel who's been doing
so much of this research for so long
not that we're not going to continue to look
that way but we can start to do some of that
ourselves and I'm really
excited because I kind of feel like I
know a lot of people in the cannabis space
definitely have this us versus them
with hemp versus
you know like type one type
versus type three cannabis and
the hemp market versus the regulated
adult use market but
honestly you know it's like the same
style it's the same style of breeding
there's a lot of different things that I
think that we can learn and that we now have
access to research these things
through the hemp
programs and there's some incredible work
being done with breeding that's
like you know really cutting edge
and you can see that those
are the people that are really making leaps
and bounds and you better believe they have
their eyes on
type one cannabis
as well and you know type two as well
but I think that I think we need to get real
clear as like the traditional legacy
market as
you know people who are making a lot of these
like breakthroughs and are using
science to do it and they're now utilizing
the diversity systems to do it
so that you know we
don't lose all this other work that has
been done previously it's kind of a little bit
deeper of a conversation but I would
I would love to hear like
what your perceptions are
you know people who are on the panel around
you know what we have to learn
from those things and how it's going
to help move us forward and bring
this kind of legacy work into the future
if I can just say real quick
I mean I know I come across as like
maybe critical
of the cannabis community in this regard
and I really don't mean to be
I mean it's hard not to
point out obvious mistakes
but the truth
is that you know this all came around
from people trying to figure out on their own
you couldn't go to a cannabis breeding school
you couldn't learn you couldn't take a course
on cannabis breeding in
high school university or community college anywhere
you couldn't get that information
from anywhere
that was illicit
like academic source so
what ended up happening is everybody
turned to their fellow criminals
right?
or their fellow labeled criminals
to seek out information
the vast majority of
those criminals didn't have
an education or weren't ever
opened up to like the real way
to do it you know or the
proper way of using these terms
so
again I just
I call these things echoes of prohibition
right? like these are the things
that we picked up the bad habits we
picked up along the way through prohibition
and it's just
I think it's part of growing up as an
industry is that we need
to shed the negative things
that we've learned during prohibition and the
ways that we just coped
and everybody
needs to up our game and then
in doing so
we're going to be seen as
a lot more
we're going to be taken a lot more seriously by the
people that run these systems around the
world
and I think it's partly our duty I mean
it's like you know
these aren't just slang words these are words that have
meaning
and when we say these words
or at least when educated people that understand these
words say these words
we choose the words
specifically because we're trying to
you know we choose
these words specifically because we're trying to convey
meaning right? we're trying to convey
information
so when I say cultivar
like when I use the term cultivar versus variety
like I'm using those terms
differently because those words mean
different things right?
and I guess it's really only the people that
understand the definitions of those words that really
get that meaning
but you can't convey
the meaning that exists in those two words
by using strain by using the word strain
right? which again
it's like 20 year long
harping on it now
and finally
we're starting to see some progress but I still
don't think that we've done it that people really have
a good understanding or a grasp of what those
words mean so that's something else
Trevor and I are going to tackle
and do a show where we can
at least start putting some of these
things out there for the people that want to learn them
I mean it's not you know it's obviously not a forced
thing nobody has to go along for the ride
but for the people that do want
to start understanding the differences
and being able to like
you know convey meaning when they're using these words
or the intricacies of meaning
I think that it'll be helpful
you don't know how many people at the university
still call us at the university
asking how to grow tomatoes
in their closet
there's so many people still scared
of the system and honestly
that's the biggest part
and if I can be of any assistance
if there's anybody in this room listening
or if you know of people who have
under 0.3 COA
to hemp varieties I'd love
to bring your seeds into
southern Nevada and have them
as part of our variety trials at the
university in the spring so that you can
start getting some of that affiliation and see
what it looks like when we do start
publishing papers on reviews
of our genetics and
what comes into fruition
once we plant them and seeing how
a university actually processes the information
because I think that's a lot of the
struggle also from the industry is
you know for example this year I grew
four different varieties one of the cherry
wine varieties that we grew
ended up being a cross with
like an LAOG or something
and they didn't tell us about it and I grew
a 3% THC
finished product
at the university and that's
not okay but guess what
it is okay but
it's not going to be okay for the grower
who submitted the seeds to us when that
gets published and they're
already certain that
they're compliant and everything else
and they don't want that information published after
the fact but they themselves knew
what they submitted to us they should have known
what they submitted to us and that's kind of
the social responsibility that
comes hand in hand with this and unfortunately
yeah there are still people afraid of the
legislation and
the stigma that comes with it but
you know luckily we do have people
that are going to a breeding level
and we do have states that are allowing growing
up to 5% for breeding development
those kinds of things I think
as we get
more vocal with the help
of the federal institutions
we'll be able to
legitimize more of these
issues that we have around
cannabis that show that the legislation
is not concurrent with how this plant naturally
grows so I
encourage anybody who's willing to take a
ride with the universities and wants to have
their genetics grown in southern Nevada to reach
out to me if you guys do want to take that
swing in the spring
Hi guys
if I could jump in for a minute
I think it was love that got started
and then Ryan you did a great job
and Trevor jumped back in talking about the
pedigrees and
the animal kingdom
and stuff like that and
I'm finding very
a lot of interest
that's sort of part of the thing I've done
in my past was
we took
they were crosses
we would call them crosses
but they all started with a
maybe a purebred line
and then we would take different pures
different
lines and breed them and they
would be crosses and then they would throw
off random types of genetics
and or phenotypes
and there
are out crosses and such like that but we
just kept working and choosing and picking
by the eye
and started paying attention to our
pedigrees that we were breeding with
and keeping up with our
sires
and our dams and our mothers and
fathers and we
finally got to a point where we was beginning
to we called them exotic
they were exotic and I was doing
pigs so you know we would throw
a litter of 13 pigs
and we started getting to a better
repetitiveness
where we could throw consistent
where that those sires
mix with these certain other
could throw
something very
close to what
was expected most of the time but
you would get some radicals you would
get some runts you would
get those outliers but
it's interesting I think
I'm going to enjoy the plant breeding because
before I ever learned to go into
the animals I was practicing
learning plant because I was trying to
understand these words that we've been using tonight
and then
Evian
mentioning
the class 3 that's sort
of where I'm at is learning
you know what
we can do because you know with the
animals we started doing stuff and we was able to
pull DNA and realize
if that breed
that we were purchasing from another
breeder if that
line that we bought from him we
could take blood work and stuff and start doing
DNA and things and I'm assuming that's
taking place in the plant with cannabis
also is it not
yep
so
I don't
know Ryan I'd be interested in and continue
learning with you that's for sure
Marissa
I like what you've got going on there
too it sounds really good
Hey Ryan and Trevor
can you tell us more about
these programs that you're going to be doing
in the future
yeah kind of came out of the idea
some of these conversations are going on the last
few weeks and people
talking snips and chips and all these
different words and
you know again again not trying to
be critical of the community but I think that like
as a lot of these new
sciences have become available to the community
we've kind of jumped
in at like the 12th chapter
of the book right
and a lot of like
a lot of people just don't
have a good solid grasp of
like chapters 1, 2 and 3
and so
the
idea came about with
Trevor and I that were
you know we approached Peter about it
to kind of do a show where we
go right back to the beginning
and we start
we kind of teach from the ground up so
it's going to start with like what is DNA
what is a cell you know how to
what are the important components of the cell
and as we work through
what DNA is and how
like the letters of the DNA
code are come about
and you know the
language of how genes are turned
into proteins or genes are turned
into RNA or whatever that is
then turned into proteins
just to try to
give like the basic
understanding of what's going on
in the basic biology
that underlies everything that we're
talking about because it really does underlie
every single thing that we're
talking about and if you don't have
a solid grasp
of the basics you're never going to get
the finer points
you know the more complicated stuff
that's in chapter 12 to the end of the book right
like all the stuff that we're going on
and so Trevor and I
kind of banded around the idea a little bit
and he's really kindly started a
series of PowerPoint presentations that we're
going to use and
just kind of teach genetics
for cannabis but from the beginning right
like right from the beginning
and we're going to focus a lot on
meiosis and
all these really things that are super boring
to most people
but with the idea that
like you know if people watch
a few of these episodes and put in the time
they're going to be much more prepared for the conversations
the more complex conversations
that the community is really starting to be faced
with
and in doing
so we're kind of going to jump
along in the same kind of idea
of the program that Chad
and Chad Westport who's in the chat right now
and Trevor are doing
with this kind of journal club thing you know back
when I was in university we used to have this thing
journal club every Friday and we'd
get together and you know drink a bunch of beer
and essentially go over a scientific
paper on the
on a Friday afternoon
with the idea to understand
to understand we're trying
to stay current in our field right
in the university you're trying to learn what's going on
in the lab and so every week there'd be something new
coming out and it would have new
techniques that we didn't necessarily knew or understand
but we're going to use those lab
techniques and the old science papers
as a way to kind of go through the
beginning through the cannabis research
from the beginning or at least from the beginning
of the molecular genetics work
kind of started in like call it like the early
90s
up until today
and every paper introduces
a new
a new technology or a new topic
be it like RFLP
or rapid you know markers
so rapid markers or
you know we're going to look at the sex chromosomes
and we're going to
at the same time we're going to not only do like the
genetics and the science of the day
but we're also going to introduce the different groups
of people that were doing
the work and kind of add
a cultural historical
cultural understanding to the
work that was going on in the day
and again with the idea to
like prep everybody to
be able to further appreciate or more deeply
appreciate what's going on today
so that's kind of like a
general overview
I don't know Trevor if you want to
touch on anything else on that but
that's kind of the general overview
That sounds cool
when can we expect that?
Um
we're still
working on it I've definitely
been doing some research
I want to get my
my powerpoint game
up I
should talk to Matthew Gates
and try and figure out a little
bit more about interactive
active powerpoints because I think
I'm back channeling you Trevor right now
just really quick I'm going to back channel
you but just please check because I
there's like some real cutting edge stuff
there that would probably be rad for you guys
and I'm happy to help
That would be awesome thank you because yeah I'm not
I know
I've done a number
of two
episodes with Chad Westport
where we've done really
incredibly
incredibly long deep dives
that
you know I think that they're
useful and helpful to people
I think that they also
having one person
go on for four
hours
on some of this stuff
isn't necessarily the best format
and if we particularly
for some of the more dry stuff
Ryan and I have talked about doing
short
concise clear snippets
that give people the
necessary background information
so that we can build up
all of the from
the molecular fundamentals
all the way up
to as he put it from chapter
one to chapter twelve so that
when we have discussions like
we had last week
and you know I'm guilty of not
having looked at my own notes
but it's like I have this information
at my own fingertips
and I failed to
like call upon it and use it
when I was
talking with Dr. Schwab
just because like I
know what micro satellites are
I know what snips are
in the moment I didn't take the time
to explain to the audience
what they were or to ask her to
explain what they were to the audience
and I feel like if
we had done that it would have been a more
informative discussion for people
as opposed to just an argument between
me and her
and you know everybody
else in the room on the different sides
but I feel like
that's something where
we can have constructive
and generative discussions
and
it can come from more of a respectful
like mutual place
when we talk to scientists
because I know
you know there can be a
clash of civilizations
at times and part of that has to do
with
I'll acknowledge like
the non-specialist
being defensive
myself and
like the fact that scientists
they speak a jargon
and come with a certain expertise
that sometimes it doesn't necessarily
translate that
well and if we can equip
ourselves with communication
skills to be able to have
conversations like that
they'll be more generative and
produce like
understanding for everybody involved
as opposed to just like
have a conflict
and that's what I hope to happen
and hope to come out of this that like
everybody in the community is
equipped with the knowledge to have these
kinds of discussions.
And that's the goal right? That is the goal
is to give people
the tools to raise the game
to raise the stakes in the game
and it's not going to be
some kind of exclusive thing where it's like
Trevor and I like preaching to everybody
we do want
to try to do
sections of every program
that are like really
limited participation because
you know too many chefs spoils the broth
kind of thing like
we really want it to be focused
so that we can get the facts
out but Peter
brought up a really great idea of bringing more
people into the discussion so I think
what we've talked about
doing at least is to do like
a planned part of the presentation
where you know whether it's
like clubhouse or whatever forum we end up
using it'll
be broadcast over
you know on the
FCPO2 channel I believe it'll
be the FCPO2 channel
that way people can follow
along and ask questions in the chat
but it'll get to a specific type
in the discussion
specific part of the discussion where
we're going to open it up and bring more people in
so that it's more of like
a classroom discussion kind of thing
because you know as
you know the people that are kind of like
quote unquote teachers
are kind of leading the discussion
we also get stuck in our own biases
right and we might not understand
like the things that the people in the community
or the audience are missing out
and so the idea is to really have
community participation
as well after we've kind of dumped
the facts down where everybody gets
to pepper with questions or just raise discussion
about the topic
because I think that that's
you know like that's really what Trevor was saying
about the discussion with Anna like
look we're all on the same side here
like again we all love this plant right
like we're all trying to increase the
increase our power
as a community and yeah we
butt heads right like
look at IG look at
any of these platforms that we use we all
butt heads and we get into like these ego contests
with each other
and the idea I'm no like I'm
you know I'm definitely no saint
in that regard
but the idea
is to try to leave all that shit out of it
but
it's not about one upping anybody or any of that
kind of stuff it's just about like
trying to lay down the facts
and you know the truth is
is that none of us have any
we don't have any ownership of the facts
right like this is
this is open to everybody and everybody's
opinion is valid
but the idea
is to just raise the level
of discussion
by addressing some of the more basic
points to get everybody
on a common ground
right and a common historical
understanding of where we've come from
that's
great I'm looking forward to it
and so I'm guessing
this cannabis breeder round table
will be a bit more
open panel and then
what you guys are doing will be a bit more
selective and
that's pretty cool I'm looking forward
to that damn Peter you just keep
bringing us the hits well we're not
trying to take over the breeders panel either like
it's not really going to be like that
it's like the idea is that
you know all these things
feed each other right I mean I think
we've seen that the last few weeks
it's like we have a discussion on the breeders round table
and then a whole bunch of information gets
distributed on IG and then people react
to that and it feeds back into the conversation
the next week right like this is
going to be like a
a living breathing animal
right and FCP is really
you know it's done
Peter has done a great job
by essentially creating this info hub
he's trying to get another
Emmy we're trying to
live breed some true breeding
stoners man
if YouTube handed out Emmys
Peter would get another one
100%
I'm excited Trevor
and Ryan because you know it's like a big part of
I feel like there's like an advocacy
piece that it's like I've tried
to get away from
I don't know I just feel like there really
needs to be more continuing education
in the
cannabis space and
I'm now faculty at Oaksterdam
and I feel
like there's you know
that's kind of like more like
people who are generally coming through the programs
on these things are you know very much
new to the space but I feel like
there's still a need for continuing
education for
people who are really in this space I have
a hard time with people who say like oh I'm
a master grower I'm a master breeder
I'm like really because I've been touching plants
for 18 years and I'm never going to master
this shit because it's always
new cutting edge science we're always learning
stuff there's always so much to
learn and I
really I'm super excited that you guys
are doing this so thank you for
for sharing because I think that's part
of the legacy I've thought for a while like I'm like
oh so I'm going to teach other people
how to grow that doesn't really make sense
I think we need more growers
and I realized actually you know
it's almost like our responsibility to instill
hope into next generations
and we need more educated
people within the space and I think
we do need to share like the wisdom and
the legacy and the pieces because a lot
of this stuff is stuff you can't just
Google you know it's like really
hard to come up so I really honor
Trevor too for like open like
sharing information in general
anybody who's open to doing that
and I think it could be really fun
I'm always game to learn
like more science and like
I love that geeking out with the white
paper thing too because it's like finding
people who are willing
we were doing it on Clubhouse earlier this
year and we had a bunch of like students and
different PhDs and like reading
complicated white papers and then
discussing because it's not necessarily
the type of thing a lot of other people
really want to do and there's a special
breeds of humans that like
geek out to the white paper about
like you know breeding for terpenes or
whatever it is so I would love to
see like you know it's great to
have base conversations
but also like the more advanced conversations
and holding space
for that is
I mean that's how I've learned
and geeking out it's like harder without
being able to be together in
space as much over the
past couple years but it's like I
remember geeking out like drinking beers with you Ryan
and like having like going deep science
geekery and it's super fun for me and
I definitely I'm excited
it's part of why I love Clubhouse because
it's like a place for us like super geeks
to unite so thank you guys
I'm excited I'm fully
signed up and I will help you guys on the back end if you guys
need help with your presentation
stuff or just please point in the right direction
make it as badass as possible
Thanks Evian that's
really cool and thank you guys all for
the positive feedback and London
just sent me an offer as well to help
with graphics or
you know a whole bunch of different stuff so it's
really you know I think
Trevor and I are both really appreciative that
hopefully people are going to be open
to it
but yeah it's going to be
it's going to be I think it'll
be fun you know my whole life is
kind of based around having fun I don't
if something's not fun why do it
and I think
you know we've had a lot of
look a lot of us
going through school we did maybe we had
some issues or whatever
I find it really easy to learn
about things that you're passionate about and
things that are like someone's trying to force
you to learn is a drag
right and I think a lot of people
got turned off of education
for whatever reasons because you know
the teachers the subject matter or whatever
but now that we've ended up in this
cannabis space there's people are passionate about it
and they want to learn and
you know dissecting
a paper on the why chromosome of cannabis
might sound like or sorry not
one paper it'll be like three or four papers
right it might sound pretty fucking esoteric
and like not not very exciting
but I guarantee you that
I think that we're gonna you're gonna
get an appreciation for some
of the genetic techniques and some of the work that
we're doing in genetics and
you know
again it's about providing everybody
with the tools
so that when we get to these points
in time where we're having finer debates over
things like CRISPR or like
you know like how
Phyllis is trying to fuck over everybody or whatever
the community whatever the whatever the discussion
is like those discussions
should be based on reality right
they should be based in
in an understanding of the science
so that we don't get into these fantastic little
arguments about like franken plants like
Trevor was saying last week or whatever
and that way we can you know we can be
honest in our debates right and we can
it doesn't end up just being a bunch
of yelling at each other
we find solutions to some of these
ethical dilemmas that we've seen come up in the
in the community right
rather than just a bunch of people talking shit
so anyway
yeah and listen feedback
from anybody that wants to contribute or has
ideas please share
like share this video
please share
like you know I'm
I don't I've got a certain
set of knowledge but I don't proclaim
to know how to do everything and I've certainly
never done one of these types of shows before
so I'm open
to contribution from
anybody anybody that can offer suggestions
or things that we're doing right or things that
we're doing wrong like that's totally
open we're totally you know
we're gonna listen to you guys
because again this is about
providing
the information so that we can all do better
for cannabis right
here
Evie brought up
a good point that I want to
touch back on anybody who comes
forward and calls themselves a master
grower or you know
master anything in this industry
space ultimately
especially from the university side and from
the horticultural side we've
only had master gardeners as
a certification that is
actually a certification
to call yourself a master in the
field and that's not even
specifically for the cannabis field that's
just for growing gardening practices and
anybody who comes forward and calls
themselves a master grower in
this industry I always that's my
first red flag to really
try to get to know what they know
because that self-proclaimed
you know title has definitely
led through to not be
true more often than it is and
I just I caught I that's
something that usually I pay attention
to and until we're working on the
curriculum right now
we've been building it out for a little bit
over a year and we're working
on a university level
curriculum that is actually a master
growers of cannabis curriculum
and I'm gonna tell you right now these conversations
that we're having in this room from
some of the speakers here in the
last 45 minutes I think I've been in this
room the level
of conversation
that it comes down to when it
comes down to cultivars phenotypes
strains
you know knowing the difference
between all of these things and actually
having the knowledge level
there's there's people in this room that have the
right knowledge level to even
be in that category but aren't calling
themselves that and that's
I'm ready for us to get to a point
where we can actually certify this
regulatory
I don't want to say legally but
be able to give people
that accolade of being a master
grower who truly deserve it rather than
just throwing that term around
as whimsically as we have in the
past so thank you for
you know bringing that up at the end because I
think that's a that's a big
pet peeve of mine in the industry and we're
getting there but like we say you know this is
the post prohibition side where we're
working through some of those kinks but
thanks for bringing that up
yeah that's a great point that you bring up
yeah I've only
met very few like master breeders too
and it's like I have like so much like it's like
I feel like that we do have some
but like I was saying earlier too it's like the
classification of those things
is curious to me because a lot of the
people that I would consider like master
breeders weren't like really using
genomics and science and
different pieces so it's like this classification
of
like I mean sure I've
I've known I mean I love like I've
met some really incredible vegetable
breeders too over the years but like as
far as the cannabis space goes because
of prohibition I would say
that a lot of the really phenomenal
breeders that I've known
not actually doing like classical
breeding and so it's really interesting
and I love that Trevor has kind of
brought this to light recently and
I'm really curious
you know kind of how
this all comes together for
this next phase you know because
I'd be curious too like the other like
Anthony or OneLove or other people who are
Chase like you know do you consider
yourself a classical breeder or are you
using genomic science or like what
we're all kind of in this different phases
and parts and I don't
know I think we're at a really interesting place
on stokes that we're going to do more continuing
education across the board.
Yeah education is huge
I definitely consider myself
a student of this plant
but I like
the master grower thing is definitely a
touchy subject I definitely know
some of the best growers I know
who are called master
growers by people
that they never called themselves master growers
but Mr. Jodry
put a really you know Kevin Jodry
put a really good perspective out there
of master grower
journeyman grower and
apprentice grower it's kind of like a
master carpenter a journeyman
carpenter an apprentice carpenter
and so it's kind of like
defining of what
you can do on an operation
can you oversee an operation without any
help do you can you oversee
the on goings of an operation
but you kind of need help to figure out what's going
on in the operation or are you apprentice
do you just show up work and
that's all you can really do
so I think that's a really cool perspective
on the understanding of like
a master whatever or a journeyman
whatever because you know these electricians
and carpenters and everything they have to
go through tests and pass and prove
that they can you know
get this title to their
name for you know X amount of pay
grade or whatever so I think
that's cool that you know Marissa you're
actually already in the footsteps
of doing that for the community you know
setting up a master grower
guideline and
I just think that's really important
because you know the schematics of everything
it's like an ego and emotion
gets involved you know it's just like oh this guy
is a frozen master grower and we may not
know anything about this person we're just
kind of like fuck this guy he's not a
master anything you know but in reality it's
kind of like maybe he is
maybe he can he or she can grow some of the
best but we have this stigma of like
we're nobody should be a
master grower like the plants the master grower
right you know so it's just the really
I think these discussions are
important to have you know and respect to
you to put out
the work for that respect to
everybody one love
one could argue the other side
of that token
and say
from the standpoint that we are trying
to establish
the goal lines before we've
even established the game that we're
playing the fact of the matter
is we don't have established standards
within the cannabis industry
how do we set goals moving
forward to even give somebody a title
you know it's very
interesting to me that people want to give
a title very quickly
in life and for me
the more that I learn the more
that I realize I don't know shit
so I think that I'm
going to be a forever student
and never a master
of anything because I think
anytime that you inherently
believe that you have something
you can put out
the furthest from the truth
Amen
cutting edge science
we have cutting edge science
all the time with cannabis and we're just barely
like cracking that code
I'm one of those people that's like
I'm a lifelong learner and that's
kind of where I've come from with this
plan is like I just
I could constantly spend all of my
time every day learning more about
this so it's like if I'm at that
and even if I could do all of
these different steps along the way
I mean I have a little bit of a hard
time because I feel like there's a subtle difference
like I am meeting more and more people who
have like actually been going to
these schools and getting certifications
on horticulture
and different things but that
they don't actually have like the
on the boots, boots on the ground
experience with
actually like touching plants or scale
and I'm realizing that there's a lot of
names and growers out there but
a lot of them aren't actually familiar with
what it takes to operate at scale
even on any of these
points so it's really fascinating to me
I mean it's fascinating to me too because it's
breeders round table, how do we apply
it like as far as breeding goes
I'd be curious your perceptions of
what actually classifies somebody as
like a master breeder you know on
that level
Can I just say something
real quick Tony? For me
the term master grower like you were talking
about in the chat about oh you can go
get a certificate program
from you know whatever
university, there's no
certificate that's going to make you a master, that just doesn't
work that way. To me a master grower
is someone that's been doing what they're doing
for 30 or 40 years
like at the highest level
and like you know for
growing context you can put them in any environment
any greenhouse field whatever
and they'll be able to diagnose and fix
any problem right and that
only comes through experience
you can't get that by learning by book
learning or by learning someone teaching you
a course how to do it. That gives you the
tools that prepare you to
go and have your 20-30 year journey
but you're truly not a master
until even 30 years and I think there's like a
you know an old martial arts
saying it's like you don't measure
a master by how many like you call it
a breeder you know like how many
seed lines they've created. The true
measure of a master is how many masters
he's created or he or she has created
right like
that's the level
yeah that's the level
of mastery is when you've taken it
and you've understood it
so well and you've been doing
it so long that you've got insights that
your average person in the space
just doesn't have
and you know and
you teach others to have that same
or you set others at least along
the path to mastery
that's where we're really you know that's
to me that's what a master is
and you Ryan earlier I just got to say you
said something that really struck me
is that you're like I only have
a certain amount of years on this rock
I'm just paraphrasing what you said I'm not going to try and quote you
exactly but you said something along the lines
of like I only have a certain
amount of years on this rock and I am not
going to complete my work with
the breeding or the legacy piece during
that time and I thought that was like such
a humble badass thing
because it's true it's like that's
the truth the real legacy is like
what you pass on and
I think that we're kind of there's a
certain type of
people in the space and I really appreciated you saying
that because you're like I'm not going to complete
my work in this time frame I'm just going to
kind of set it in motion essentially
so that's really an
honorable way to
understand kind of where we're at
yeah thanks for
reflecting on that because I mean that
stood out big time for me Ryan
like I just had a kid and I was like
damn like the things that I
want to accomplish within my breeding
like I need to start teaching my youth
really young about this stuff because like
he's got a lot of work to finish
you know it came about
out of a sense of panic one day I realized
that I wasn't going to get through a bunch of projects
that I had too many seed lines
and I had too much work to do and it was like
it just you have to come to an
acceptance it's like you know as you mature and you get
older you start thinking about death I'm not
far off from thinking about death really
or at least my own death
but
I think that it's a good
way to look at it right because
it just again we're all
here for the plant
this is not about any one of us this
is about if we truly
love the plant and we truly believe
all the things that we've been saying for the past
25 years
cannabis is getting to where it's legal
now I mean for me it's legal I'm in cannabis
so it's legal for me here and you guys
that are in the states are well on the path
to legalization
and
you know it's time for us to kind of shit or get
off the pot like we've all been preaching about
what we would do
if cannabis were one day legal and it's like
that day has come knocking
and now we get to
we get to cash in all those
sacrifice chips that we've put in over the last
25 years and I know all you guys up in
Mendo and Humboldt and Trinity
you understand that statement because
it's been nothing but sacrifices
and some good times along the way but
you know we need
to
we need to put all these things
in motion get cannabis into
the mainstream respect
the elders and the people that have sacrificed
for the plants
make sure that they're taken care of or at least
they're not ripped off and discarded
and
that you know that people have an opportunity
to find their place in the new world
right and then we can do all the great
things that we've you know we can show all the great
things that we've said cannabis can do for the last
40 years right
I think it's kind of
our duty to I mean I feel like it's super
easy to get jaded especially
like currently there's like a lot of
sometimes I hear myself
and I'm like oh like I feel like
I feel like I sound super jaded sometimes
especially like when the market's
crashing and things are tough and it's hard
and like the regulated industries are so challenging
and it's just like someday
it'll all make a fantastic book
but I realized that just
recently actually
like a colleague actually I think a few
of you here had a really great
conversation around there's been
there's been these great articles about Jane
Goodall and how it's
she's coming out with a new book or something
along the lines of like that it's our
job to instill hope in the
future generations and I kind
of really applied that back to what I
believe around cannabis and it helped me
to feel better
about like educating other people
to cultivate or passing on that
knowledge to other people like everything that I've
learned because I feel like I want to instill
hope and not like this
jaded frequency that
I want to pass on what I've learned so
other people can you know
be successful and they do because I know that the lessons
that I've learned have been really hard won
and are still continue to be
so I really honor
anybody in this space that's like trying to
help lift other people up and
bring hope for this next phase
and it's not just all about the money for
some people so thank you guys for this
really it's nice and more philosophical
edge to the conversation
I have got a shirt that says
hope not dope
I like it
nice one Jody toss that one
in there hope
through dope
hope through dope
I want to say really quick
go ahead all right you guys were talking
about the master
grower and it makes me think about
our line when
we have a master breeder maybe you
could call it but then where I sort of
fell into it I was more would be
I'm not using I'm just using the word
master because of the topics master
grower being that
I was the feed guy
to be able to take with that breeders
deficiencies and try to make those
genetics that were there to come to
life maybe than the lacking areas
and I guess I see that this
industry you know it would be a lot
the same some people would really specialize
in that art of the
breeding but someone else might
be able to help feed and nurture
and care for that
to get it to its full potential
like that and so it's sort of
like fitting right along with
just how
there's so much to learn and then we
all might not be a master of it all but we can
come to collaborate with each other because
I would then have another person
in my group and I would be a part
of all this but we would go
and he would be the selector
from the breeders so we would
go to the breeders best
and we would go and sort through
and he would be the
selector based off the
what we knew about the pedigree and the line
and then I would be he would ask me
can we feed that deficiency
you know and it's like some things you
could feed and some things you can't
with bone we had to breed
for bone so we started doing
things specifically to breed for bone
but if I needed more flank or
I need more belly or I need more firmness
or I need more muscle well we could feed that
but then we would get
to the point where we were building muscle
and didn't have to feed muscle so
ultimately we was trying to think about
the end user which was going
to be our next generation
that they would get an animal that
we could give them a recipe to
follow and sort of make it easy for them
and then begin to pick through
those kids and train them and we would take
them off to the side and we would have courses and classes
and just sort of
give them hope that they could create a
grand champion
I think it's so interesting
to approach the breeding from
that standpoint I know your background a little bit
Jody so that's interesting to kind of
tie it around to
like how it all kind of ties together
I know that I think Trevor and Ryan have brought that
up I just want to say really quickly
that I was looking for a
paper on terpene breeding from a couple years
ago I think we brought it up like maybe last
week or the week before and maybe
it was like the breeding for flavor
white paper and as I was looking
that up because there was a question I had in there
for a couple people on the
panel I actually came across
like speaking of the lifetime learning thing
I came across a paper
because I'm really big on the
work I do with the ethical data alliance
and you know it's like trying to
actually use blockchain technology
to you know
essentially like my goal is that it
traces all the way through from
the breeder all the way through to the end
consumer and that we're utilizing
blockchain technology to do that and that's kind
of what the non-profit work for the past couple years
and as I'm looking for the terpene
breeding paper I just found a
white paper on
applying blockchain
technology to cannabis
that I hadn't read yet because we've been
working on a couple different ones and I found one
that I haven't even read so it's like a
great case in point
it's like there's so much information
and that we're all kind of coming together
to like share and talk
about these different things so I'm
going to keep looking for this other one because I
have a question for you but it's so cool
that we're like that
we can get down with the science at this
point it's really fun
Hey on that note
how's it going y'all this is
Sam
I'm loving this conversation and I just wanted
to do first off
a little PTR
to refresh so that everyone
who maybe has hopped in the room because I
know that myself I hopped in the room I've been
listening for a while and I'm loving the conversation
so much
and I'm actually sitting here
with a buddy of mine who's been
cultivating and breeding for
27 years or so and I've
probably been at 20
20ish
but I just
I'm just wondering what exactly the conversation
about is this a show that you guys
are planning on doing is it here
on clubhouse this a regular thing
what is the context of
what you guys are putting together and I'm loving
the sound of it breeders roundtable
all about it and then I would love to chime in
if that's alright with everybody and
ask some questions and talk about some of the
projects I'm seeing happen right
now some of them in
coalition with the ethical
data alliance as well and
the project with Canopyright
which is blockchain technology
I'm sure you're familiar with Evian
and yeah other than
not just stoked on the conversation good to see
some heads up in this motherfucker
yeah
great yeah I just
I wanted to circle back at some point and talk about
that because there was a breeders panel
last week that I think maybe I don't know if anybody
here besides Sam was on but there's
some interesting conversations happening around
how we can kind of protect more of the legacy
work utilizing technology
so I
Sam just to be clear I think we're talking about
two distinct things here
one is this
what we're doing right now which is a
I kind of just always thought it'd be
cool to have a weekly
kind of BYO topic
with a bunch of
people I like and respect
many of whom are on
the stage right now just kind
of shooting the shit and then just the conversation
goes wherever it goes and it's on
Clubhouse and all the
things that Clubhouse brings
where like some
mad scientist walks into the room
we bring him up on stage and the conversation
goes in whatever
direction the other thing
is what I think you're also
talking about which Trevor and Ryan
are putting together
the
how it
happens I think is still a little up
in the air it could be a
Clubhouse with them both logged
in kind of visually
like on StreamYard
which is what I use but or it could just be
all on
like kind of like a
Zoom meeting versus
Clubhouse
but I think the main gist of
it is that they have points
they want to get across so like
it's just the two of them
and then at some point maybe
invite participation but I'll let
Trevor and Ryan kind of
talk specifically about what
the bringing people
up to chapter
12 is all about
if I could
jump in too Sam
this is like the least
formal Clubhouse room in Clubhouse
it's like
it's not the typical things if
you're familiar with Future Cannabis Project check them out
because it's a stream we are streaming
this on to the other side
as well and it's
like Peter said it's a much more
casual kind of sit down and let the conversation
come and go
and we have a lot of people come up and join
and jump in the conversation or just sit down
in the bottom and listen and see
what's going on there so
welcome to the stage Sam
cool I love it yeah
thank you guys and I am familiar with
Future Cannabis Project and Peter
and I know I think I
just saw Jackson
Mean Gene finally jumped on Clubhouse
the other day so hopefully his
ass will pop up in here one of these days
and get his feet wet but yeah
I love seeing
so many like old school
and solid heads that I know really care
about the plant and care about the culture
and you know the legacy here
so that's amazing and
you know I'm excited
to see where things go you know of course
everyone's kind of on edge with technology
like blockchain
and can it be right type
you know stuff
because of the whole Phylos experience
but I'm looking really really carefully
into that whole process and
I've spoken to Jeff Hamilton
the founder a couple times and really feel
like everything about it
is ethically aligned and in
the right place and I even have some
tech folks and hackers that I'm gonna
I'm basically recommending that you know we
basically have a hackathon against it
to prove that it is as safe as they
say it is and things like that
but we definitely need breeders coming to the table
to try it even if they're just
putting in like you know
whatever not definitely not your
top notch shit off the bat maybe not
even real stuff we've talked about just doing
trial to see how the platform
functions and whatever else but
definitely all about supporting whatever solutions
we can to support
breeders in you know
protecting what they've worked
diligently on for years especially
real breeders that aren't just throwing around
mutt fucking strains that
are you know hype shit
that I have a hard time
getting behind to be perfectly
honest you know any of that
stuff so but anyway I'm just
loving it and I think this is a great idea to have
something going like this that is super
open flow and
you know casual and more like
we're all sitting down you know
smoking and doing the damn thing
like back in the day and
now have this technology where we can
come together and sit in a space from
different locations is
pretty epic so I'm
appreciating it for sure man
all you guys thank you
cool
thanks Sam I'm back on
I just put my
two year old to bed
so but yeah there were a couple
of things I wanted to jump on and
touch on
was that your two year old giving you a round
of applause?
no the
this is the downstairs doing the best
they can to wake up the upstairs
so you know how that life
goes
but
yeah the
the idea of
like master growers
and I mean just
gets thrown around
and
debated and argued and
I've made my own jokes
about it
I feel like it's something
that
I think we lost you
you can be a pollen
chucker and also
know all of this stuff these aren't
mutually exclusive and
part of it is actually
about circumstances
am I breaking up?
um okay
but I feel
like because we've been in a situation
where we couldn't grow large populations
a lot of people didn't know
about all of the intricacies
of plant breeding and didn't have
access to academic resources
we haven't really had the
opportunity
I think we lost you
now you're back
more so than like
try not to be exclusionary
and giddy towards each
other about who's a real
breeder and not that's kind of one
thing I wanted to chime in about
yeah
this is not going to be exclusive
and again listen we've gone through our 15
20 years of that
and I think it's probably part of it
it comes from the fact that we're all in these
forums using the
anonymous handles and that just
that state alone like kind of
breeds the feelings
for people to talk to each other disrespectfully
we gotta
get past that
right and I mean I'm
you know I've kind of
stopped using the chimera name
um
I use it on the chat just because
people recognize who I am a little more
but um you know
I gotta tell you like with legalization
happening and coming out as myself
it's done a lot
of wonders and I find
to a large degree people are like
a little bit more respectful
and you know I think
this is just about like setting up a system
where again we can
engage in these conversations without it being
ego based or like talking shit
it's not this is
you know saying people can't do
it because they don't understand DNA or
whatever like that's the antithesis of what
this project is about the
idea is to democratize
the knowledge
right so that
people can do this
and you know Evian was talking
before about
all these breeders that she knows that are you know master breeders
or whatever have been doing it for decades
without using science that's great
like those are all valuable tools
you don't have to get rid of those tools
we're talking about another set
of tools that we're gonna
provide people with the language for that other
set of tools so they can then
incorporate those tools into the way that they were always
doing things right it's just
adds another layer another way
to understand the thing
that we're all trying to do
and I think for
the people that get through all the boring
shit about you know
purines and pyrimidines and YA's
T's and G's and C's make up
this letter of this language of DNA
I mean it can be pretty dry
um
but the truth is
that these chemicals or
these the DNA that these nucleic
acids you know
one thing that came up for me when I was
studying genetics in university was that
like
DNA or RNA
whatever you want to whichever way you want to
look at it is essentially
the organism that exists
on the planet and
every other life form be it
the bumblebee the fruit fly the
tree the single celled yeast the single
celled you know
blue green bacteria all
the food chain to humans and tigers
and elephants we are all
just different expressions
of DNA finding a way
to propagate itself on the planet
right so
you can kind of think of it in a way
that like DNA is the real organism
and all of everything else
that's alive is just an expression of that
DNA
um
and if you understand DNA and how it works
and the kind of the rules of the DNA
world
you're just better equipped
as an organism to shape another
organism right like we're better equipped as humans
to be able to
it just adds extra
tools to be able to go about your plant
breeding in a certain level of understanding
that you might not get
without it you probably won't get without
it in fact
so this thing you know like
Trevor saying this isn't about like
pooh-poohing the people that don't know
this stuff that's the antithesis
of the project the idea is to like give
all these people the tools
if they want them right we just want to put
it out there so that the people that
want to like invest a little bit
of energy and go through
like you know those first few chapters
of that are a little bit of a grind
you know it's going to be a little bit of work for people
to kind of like get through some of this stuff
but once we get through
those first couple of chapters
it's going to be about fun
and learning the history
of the plant and the history of the
cannabis research and
why different groups were doing
it and I think
that people will really
they'll enjoy the journey
because we're going to try
to make it like salient
right it's not just about
DNA it's about the DNA
and what work was done
when and who were the people
that were benefiting
all of us by doing the work
what were their reasons
and who were they
so I think
it'll be fun and maybe I'll just geek it out
it'll be really dry
but anyway for the people that are passionate
about it I hope that you find something
interesting and
like I said we're open to suggestions
for people that want to add
add context or add
you know feedback so
it should be interesting
yeah
just doing like and granted
I feel like you know
I'm in a pod so
my
outside
of Chemera and myself
or I'll find it
interesting but
yeah it's
going in and looking at that
stuff and just scratching the surfaces
I have it's one made
a lot of the papers that I read
otherwise much more informative
just to go through
and have a
refresh have it fresh
in my mind when then I go
you know
about all these different
the different
metabolic pathways that are
producing the different secondary
metabolites or things like this
I just
I just
cellular biology
sort of basic
101 and now
I'm reading about it here
in an actual
application for how
we produce terpenes and
cannabis and things like that
tools to understand
these papers and so
it'll be much easier to
go through read
some of these scientific white papers
and have a quick
and easy consumable sort of like
reference
back to you
and be like okay
hey
here's
my primer on that
and that way
searching through tons of
you know hours and hours and
hours of video you can just find
a nice short 5 to 10
minute primer on that
issue specifically
with
power
I think we just lost you again
now that's me
Trevor just muted himself so
Trevor you're breaking up
a little bit
sorry yeah I'm trying to find a place
where I have good internet
but yeah mostly just saying
hopefully
we can go through provide these primers
and have them be consumable
so that people can actually just
go and reference them
as needed as opposed to
having to you know wade through
hours and hours of discussion to find
some small
very specific
subset of like
you know we'll go into
MTDNA chloroplast DNA
and these different types of
the different parts of the cells
and explain all of those
individually as like
compartmentalized
primers so to speak
yeah and it's
going to be peppered with like you know
knowledge about the plant too like what you know
for example we'll be talking
about like you know nutrients
and why certain like when we're talking
about DNA we'll be explaining like
you know the DNA backbones like
essentially can structure to phosphate
and so when you've got these like
rapid you know
either like during
rooting or you know floral development
or whatever when you have these massive demands
for DNA duplication
obviously you need to be feeding phosphorus
right like so there's a whole bunch of
little tie-ins
that kind of just like make sense
or apply to like the context of
like what we do as growers
but yeah it's
anyway
we should just stop talking about it and do it
I think at a certain point
but yeah like
you know I think it's going to be fun and
yeah we're looking forward to it
and I'm glad to hear some of you guys are looking forward to it as well
stoked I'm excited
I love it I think the more that we can
keep deep diving and it's been
really great I mean I would just want more time
to be able to pour over some of the
especially the information that Trevor
has been just like dumping
all of this incredible information
lately
and I had a couple I mean questions
just back to like the breeding piece because
you actually made me think of a couple things Ryan
and so I'd be curious to the
breeders on the panel you know
when you're talking about like feeding because it's
something that I really noticed when things are
in seed production
that it's definitely like
I see some people kind of
make errors during the feeding process
and I would be curious what
your opinions are because I feel like
the plant has different requirements when you're doing
seed production as opposed
to when you're doing flower
production it's like two different animals
I definitely have observed
and then I did find the white paper and would love
to get back to like at some point
the you know
breeding for specific terpenes
and like specifically I'm
curious about pest but that's a
different topic so let's go that way in a little
bit but I'm just curious if people have ideas
around feeding
or have noticed or observed those similar
kind of things
I treat
I treat my seed plants as
like I had this friend
we're living up in the middle of nowhere and she
was pregnant and I used to go into
the store you know we'd drive into town and go
to the store and you know we'd
pick up stuff for her when she was pregnant of course
and she used to be like you know
get me the highest fat yogurt that you
can find right and it's like that
was her body telling her something because when you got
a baby developing inside you it's
developing a nervous system right your brain
is like mostly composed of fat
right like these you have got these
myelin sheaths that are essentially fat
insulators that wrap
around your neurons and so
as she's you know she's got this baby grown inside
her that's developing this nervous
system it's like you need to feed fat to the
kid right that's part of the diet
and so I kind of take that philosophy
with when I'm feeding my seed mothers
it's like I just feed them
like a complete diet
you don't want to push it on them but you definitely
want to make sure that everything is available
and I
don't like I don't know like that's something kind of
kind of I came up with my own just through
rationale like I've never had anybody teach
me that but so
I'm not actually even sure if that's like the
right way to be doing it for example
but you know when I
look at those nutrient bottles that are like
you know the kind of the
salts and stuff that they feed
that they feed you as a commercial cannabis
grower like the hydros stores push you on
like I never felt that those were
like definitely not designed to
be feeding on a
seed crop right so I kind of just took the approach
of like how can I provide
everything that this plant could possibly need
in that same
kind of zeitgeist so
I was the same way
except for I also try to increase
potassium levels
since seeds are
high there's potassium
sink on the plant they're going to store
potassium in there so if you come up short on potassium
you're going to have issues with some of your
seeds are going
also
boron boron can be
helpful when
processing and breeding seeds
so Pankaj do you have a question
or comment
yes sir
first of all from India good morning
to all ladies and gentlemen I'll just
take five minutes to put up
my point basically
when we are talking about the future
of cannabis we need to look
at the history of the cannabis as
if such you all may be knowing about it
but how the laws were drafted
and how it has
become a blockade in the
progress of the future of the
cannabis I just I'll just take five minutes
to explain my point basically
now what happened
if you look at the history
it was a very prominent plant in
Indian mythologies as well as there
are almost
which I remember 191 medical
formulations in Ayurveda pharmacopoeia
related with the cannabis
one point so there was a very good
rich history of
cannabis in India but what happened
I'm sorry to say I don't know
from which all nationalities
we are what happened is
people from Europe they discovered
America they discovered gold over
there they become a very strong and rich
country but unfortunately
they did not have the
knowledge and heritage and cultural
background which can give them the
information about the diversity
and the past uses of
the this cannabis plant what happened
the laws were started made laws
are of two types one law is between men
and men I hurt you you can go
to please you hurt me I can go to the
law the thing other law is between
men and the men and the
things which cannot speak for themselves
you have property somebody
does harm it harm to it
you go to the law but when
something like natural thing cannabis
was taken into consideration
the Americans they became rich
newly the kids were getting
spoiled because of
all those things which were
available nothing was there to do
so they follow the hippie culture
and they were worried about their next
generation so in 1961
United Nations was precise
to put a blanket ban over
all the world in terms
of the
and cannabis
got involved in that
the western countries they realized
somewhere in 1963 the THC
was a component some Israeli
scientists discovered that
which is causing the
psychotropic effect on the human beings
so what's happening is that
now they are trying to put
industrial
hemp in place of
cannabis to escape
to escape
the policies they have
done to the
whole world now again the
United Nations should come up and
remove the plain blanket
law which they have
put in front of the whole world
because of the reason
we are not aware about
the plant, plant speaks through the
science, plant cannot speak for itself
humans can impose
the laws on the process not on
the natural thing just because of this
foolishness today they are
sitting and talking about the
environment they are talking
about the COP26 are sitting
Paris Samillions are taking place
so now we have to
accept our mistake and we have to
realize that yes we did a wrong thing
now remove the cannabis, cannabis is a plant
it cannot speak for itself, yes you can
put a ban on the process that you cannot
make hashish, you cannot make cocaine
but let's not interfere with the nature
let it grow
that is what my point
is to put up in the learned audience
I've been posting about this topic
on Instagram all week
about the 1961
treaty on
narcotic drugs for people to dive
into to try to learn about some of the
exact topics that
is talking about here
I appreciate you bringing that up
it dives into people
understanding some of the reasons
why we have laws dictating
what is happening here
and how we can go about changing
them through legislation
in our own countries and educating
our own communities
and our populations
we're too stuck on old ways
and if we don't learn the rules
that we're playing by and just
keep telling each other that we're veterans
of a drug war
then we're going to stay stuck on stupid
for way too long
Pankaj
you definitely touch
on a subject, this is Marisha
from University of Nevada
I don't have
much to add because you're making
a very valid point, I just want to second
your opinion because that is why
I've chosen my path
in life. I've spent
20 years as a chef, I worked
as a firefighter and a paramedic
so I got trained in the American Medical
Association and I learned
how our medical system works. I went
to law school as well
and I worked on different projects for the
Department of Taxation and I chose
horticulture as my path
because it was the one place
that I could use
the irrefutable data regardless
of how language and borders
can obscure and create divide
I was able to find
my niche in horticulture
because for me that is the one place
that I can speak up
as a voice on behalf of a plant
that cannot defend itself
and bring it true to legislation
to governors, senators,
presidents, whoever and make
the data irrefutable
and for me I took that position
because I realized that the only place
that I would be able to argue strongly
on the matter is by using
their own data. I don't want to say
against them but if we use their
own data they can't refute it
and so for me that was the strongest
voice that I could have
was to take the federal data
about plants that can't speak for themselves
and have that voice for them and try
to bring it forward on behalf of spirit
above everything else
because ultimately the
patterns we see in nature and the
ways that plants grow
unaltered by human
involvement is truly the
patterns that we should be following before we
take anything of our own minds on this
dimension into parameters.
I love that.
I 100%
am right there with you
and I love that
I don't want to mispronounce your name
but
Ancaj, that you, it's the same
for me, I've researched
I believe it was Patanjali that
originally said there's four ways
to enlightenment and one of those
ways, I think it's the fourth way
is with the plant spirits
and I think that I've
researched a lot on my own, all of the
ingredients and all of these ancient
different
Ayurvedic formulas that cannabis
is definitely a huge part of that and it also
was a huge part in the early American
pharmacology
so I think
that we're really missing the point
and I think that we really need to use
this post-prohibition
era thinking that we're kind of stuck
in still to enforce
legislative change
and using data and
science at this point because
I'm a big believer that plants
back in ancient
history is that the reason people
knew how to understand what the plants were
saying is because we could hear back then
there wasn't as much interference and noise
so people knew to mix certain
plants and different medicines like in the Amazon
basin and we have no
full understanding of how
ancient people knew
just knew that they needed to put
two certain things together in order to
create that and at this point we
have science and data on our side
and so if we can use that to inform
policy and legislative
change it's really
I think there's a lot of us that are working for
a similar piece to try and speak for the plants
so thank you for
bringing that to our attention
Ladies and gentlemen, what is my concern?
I'll just briefly tell about myself
I'm not a biologist
nor I'm an agriculturalist, I'm basically
a defense retired person
with avionics engineering degree but
things happened in such a way
I happen to be the only person in India who has
grown seven crops of industrial
hemp. The first license was
awarded to me in
Uttarakhand district. I have placed a
public interest litigation in the high
court putting up my point
and the way people are framing
the law and using the law
to settle the political scores
rather than thinking it
judicially. If somebody wants
to assess my papers I can share with
them
I have put in the high court of Uttarakhand
I'm not telling
that humans should
not
make laws against psychotropic things
What is my concern is
that humans can make laws
on the process
not on the things
they are not aware about
because we put all the urea
we put all the pesticides and today we
are crying because
we don't consider the ancient knowledge
Knowledge comes in two forms
one which we gain from our five sense organs
and extension given to our
five sense organs through the
science by microscopes and
telescopes and all but the other knowledge
comes through the generations
and through the generations
knowledge cannot be defined
just because present science
cannot understand what
is experienced. Experience
is something different. I can read a whole
book about sugar but a small
spoon of sugar
can just refute the whole knowledge of what
I have read in the book. So things
we have to just respect the thing
respect the knowledge which has come through the
generations. I am not telling that it cannot
be refuted. Yes, new information
can always, science
can only progress by refuting itself
Newton was refuted by Albert Einstein
that's why science can progress
Science cannot say that today it has
progressed to its zenith. Science cannot
say that I have known everything
So let's leave the nature on
its own and let's not make
law on the nature. We
should make only law on the process
Yes, you cannot make hashish, very
fine part of it but don't
put problem on the ganja that is flowering
part of it. And thing has happened
in this fashion. There is no research
being done on alcohol as well as
cannabis. Do the research, find
out what are the problems
the history is there in front of you
Every year thousands and thousands
people die because of alcohol but that is
legal. Government collects the tax
but cannabis
which is a natural product which does
not harm the human body. I am not talking
I am immediately not talking about
the spiritual
development through the cannabis
I am just talking what science can
understand to taking the EEG
I have carried out my EEG with
normal condition, with consumption of the cannabis
with consumption of the alcohol and I am
doing research. Let's get
together and let's
work in such a fashion
we can pressurize the United Nations
in some or other way rather than hiding
behind the buildings and doing
the research. Let's come out in the open and fight
the war. I
think that we need to start utilizing
the UN sustainable
development goals as how you can apply
them to cannabis and I have really been feeling
that for a while now in the non-profit
that we have, the Ethical Data Alliance
we put
some of our founding ideas
and the concept of the
SDGs are definitely things that
I think that it is really cool
because what you are saying is essentially
it is like the legacy
kind of what we are going through here in America
with the legacy market also
it basically seems like
the same vision
so I really appreciate it
I can tie it all together in my head
I am thinking it is all kind of aligned
so that is very cool. Thank you
Yeah, that is a good point
I also
Tony had posted something
I think it was
about a Canadian paper
talking about the
single convention
which is the
1961
convention
on narcotics
and
I had found another paper
that went in a little bit deeper
and talked about
specifically how
while the
single convention clearly does
outline and prohibit
or yeah, prohibits
countries that are
signatories from
legalizing
or having like a recreational
or commercial market
that isn't completely government run
according to this article
one of the things they pointed out
was how there are
very clear
contradictions between
other treaty obligations that
Canada is a signatory
to, particularly
human rights treaty obligations
and the issues
regarding how racism
and human rights violations
are associated with the persecution
of the drug war across the world
and so
the authors were essentially saying that
we have a situation where
to
for Canada to
continue to persecute
the drug war and to continue
to enact and enforce
prohibition in the single convention
they have to violate
other treaty obligations as it pertains
to human rights
Evian just pointed out
the good example with
sustainability
goals and
Pankaj
I think you're pointing out
some very specific
local issues in India and the judicial
system there and legal arguments
that you're bringing up and bringing in front of the
courts there. I think that all of these
strategies are things that
like Tony's been mentioning
people need to pay
attention to the fact that there are
international treaties and yes
legalization at the
state, local, federal level
all of that's great
it would also really
improve a lot of
research and
like issues
with regard to germplasm
preservation and
storage and access
all of that's hindered by the current
system and if
we were to get rid of the single convention
and prohibition on cannabis
by
largely I mean pointing
out the incongruence of
that treaty with
every other treaty obligation that
most of these countries are signatories to
hopefully some movement can
be made. Unfortunately
the UN rejected
like four out of
five of the World Health Organization's
recent reforms that they
proposed in December of
last year. So
not a great sign but hopefully
At COP26 also
they didn't allow the kind of hemp
stuff ended up getting pushed to the
outside as well so that's like
another just kind of like deniance
of the fact that hemp could
potentially you know help push
some of these things forward so it was
very disconcerting
that like it wasn't welcomed
to the table and I mean there's a whole
bunch of other issues with COP26
but I think it's
really really important and I think that
I mean Ryan didn't you post something earlier
today about India also which is
like it's interesting that
it all kind of ties together. I really appreciate
that Trevor. I'd like to maybe we should deep
dive around some of the bigger issues
and problems but I'm thinking about the
germplasm and seeds and like
are we even allowed to have hemp
I mean is hemp even in any of the
larger seed banks that are happening
or you know cannabis in general
like you know I don't think they're in
deep storage at the seed banks. I'd be
very curious to find out.
There are some hemp lines that are
stored in the seed banks
like panola and such
the lines that are used for
seed production, oil production
read
by anybody that's on Instagram.
Yeah the Vavlov
Institute, I'm sure Trevor
was probably just jumping in to say this but
the Vavlov Institute in Russia
has like a whole bunch of old
like I mean I guess I would call them
land races at this point in time but
populations that were collected from
all over like all over
Russia essentially all over Siberia
and whatever areas that it was present
over there.
So that's kind of
cool. I know that the panola actually came
from two lines. Panola was known as
314 but there
was actually two lines that David Watson got
from.
Yes the two lines that David Watson got
from the Vavlov Institute. He used to actually
support them when he was doing the
International Hemp Association and he
was actually like paying Vavlov
Institute out of his pocket
from his own
cannabis work which I thought was
really quite admirable and in return
they essentially opened up the collection to him and
said hey if there's anything that you'd like
from the Institute to work with let
us know and we'll send it to you. And so he got
these two lines that were
labeled in the Vavlov
Institute catalog as 315
and 313
and when he
grew them out in the Hortifarum Greenhouse
he said they were almost identical.
They were like, they were clearly
collected from like
you know close populations because
they shared like a great degree of similarity.
I think they were like really quite
likely the same population.
And so he crossed them both together
just open pollinated them, crossed them
both together to kind of reintroduce any
you know to make it one family
with a greater genetic diversity
and that line
he called 314 and that was
what was given to James Calloway
who went on and bred phenola
from it. So
anyway, the point is that there are
some of these international seed banks that are
stocking hemp. In Germany
they do as well and I'm sure in France
they also do but I don't think there is a really
good place that has an international
collection of drug varieties
which is a shame.
Which is a shame
because again they're like pieced out
throughout
all these different
custodians around the world, many of
who are on the stage.
Yeah, it's a
weird one. Again
cannabis being left out of the system, right?
We couldn't access these
systems for so long
and
now we're feeling the effects of that.
That's
such cool history, Ryan. Thank you
for sharing that because that's the sort of stuff that
you can't exactly Google or
like so much of this
information and stuff that's just
kept within the seed keepers.
Someday I would really love
I've said this before and I've said
this to some of the other seed keepers is I
would absolutely love
to start to document. I was really
hoping that somebody would actually start
documenting because in traditional indigenous
cultures it's like seeds generally
come with a story and there's generally
seed carriers and they're the ones that
they have all of these
stories. So I would
really love to see
more of that documented
especially just so
it doesn't get lost.
These stories are really valuable. Really
appreciate when people
share things like that.
I'd
just like to put
one or two points basically because
I have to take the classes. The students are waiting
for me.
As you were telling about the history, I just
put something important. I don't
know what ladies and gentlemen
are aware about it or not. In India
living things are
considered to be made from
five elements. The one element that is
earth, plant is made from them.
Then there are two elements
mosquitoes,
mouses, everything and these
all type of things made from these things
and then three level of items that is
birds
and four level of items that are animals
and five level of items that is
basically humans are made from them. Earth,
water, fire,
then sky that is
the vacuum. One more is
there. So humans are made from the
five elements. Then in the
Indian mythology what they have done
from the smallest
one, the cannabis were considered
as the king of everything and that is
being given to Lord Shiva.
So because of the reason if you
see a cannabis plant, remaining
all flowers are very distinct flowers. You see
rose, it is different from the leaves of the
rose. You see any other flower, it's different.
Whereas in cannabis, the growth
is in such a fashion, the large
flowers, they form in
a form of a flower and that
gives the next generation. What it symbolizes
basically, humans
are a ladder between
animal and divinity as per
Indian culture.
So the hemp plant, the
terpenes are the
top thing which is happening and
flowers are converted into the terpenes.
That way they have put the cannabis
into the top category. Then mouse
is put among the two things.
Then three, peacock
is considered, Lord Krishna
holds that and four,
cow is considered and humans are the
top most. That I am just telling you the story
of Indian culture.
So what's happening
is, things are that humans
are making laws for all animals,
plants, birds and everything.
Whereas humans themselves
are not, themselves
cannot say that they have achieved the pinnacle
of the science. So I feel
it's injustice to the nature
by making the law for other things.
Thank you everybody.
Appreciate you
for the information you brought to us.
Thank you. Yeah, thanks
Thanks Pankaj. It's really nice to hear
your input.
Yeah, thank you for
coming on. That was an interesting
tie-in philosophical
kind of also part there.
Thank you
everybody. Thank you. Sorry for
moving out of the room.
Yeah, no.
Thank you for coming on. That was definitely
that was very cool.
I think we're all in agreement
that
any legal system
that tries to codify
how this plant is
going to be handled is
you know, silly hubris.
And
it's something that unfortunately
people have done for, throughout
history. But more the
I think
the long story of cannabis
and what we, you know, need to
try and definitely
pay attention to
when we're telling
this story is the long
history and
going back
finding points of origin
finding the dispersion
the diffusion and
dispersal of the plant through
different scientific evidence that's
available in different studies that are out
there and trying
to trace that history and being
as like, you know
honest about
humans' interaction
with the plant for, you know,
12, 10,000 years, however
long we've been cultivating
it and
tracing all that from
its origins to the
present. And that's
something that really
shows that every culture and every
different group has been able to
use this plant for its own purposes.
And it's only a very small select
few over the last
tiny fraction of human history
that were dumb enough to think that they
could prohibit it or
regulate and create laws
that were going to
you know, codify how people would
interact with it. So
lots of, just empirically
everything he said is true.
Like it's very silly this
way that we've related to the plant
in the sort of
modern judicial
sort of framework.
I'm fairly certain that
Homi said that, you know
like, which I love this perspective, is
like, cannabis is king of everything, but I guess
maybe queen, but like, just
like that right there
is just like, you know, if that's
like the ancient history in ancient
history in Indian culture, if
it's like straight up like the queen
of everything or the king of everything, and it
is true, you know, when you look at like
so I've looked at some of this stuff myself. I mean
if you've ever been in those rituals, it's like
they're, you know, like pouring bong
over the lingam and it's like the crazy thing
and all the shivites and the whole thing.
It's like, it's like we've
gotten, I think, far away from
some of the cores, and I gotta say that
was really fun to have him come on
here as like, it's one of I think the
really cool features of Clubhouse
is that, you know,
it's like, just to steer the conversation
in that way, because it's
a great reminder
that I think there's a lot, there's
an ancient history here that we forget about
sometimes. We get really caught up in like
oh, the legacy market and
you know, the regulated market and all these things
that we're dealing with, but at the end of
the day, I think that
you know, this is a lot more
ancient and
dare I say holy than
I think we get caught up
in like genomics and science and all these things
sometimes and maybe forget.
So it was a good,
it's a good reminder
that maybe we lost the plot
as humans somewhere down the line.
It's not relevant whatsoever,
but I got a
third eye dermal piercing
and I've worn a tikka bindi
for a couple of years, especially since
I got into horticulture, and one
of the main reasons I got my piercing
on my third eye is to
avoid the conversation of religion
and go back to the basics of understanding
that truly like,
I think it was Pankaj
had spoken about
you know, what really matters
and going back to the root
of spirit and really taking
it back to
the basics before humans applied
language and laws and borders and all of this
divide that we do just by
using our voice where we can and
creating that, those limitations that
we have with language and going back to
the basics of understanding the truth
and the powers in nature.
They are greater than us.
And I think he brought a good
point to bring us back to the basics here.
So I definitely, I
value it as well. Thank you so much for
the rest of you finding the value in
this too. Folks,
I got to bounce. It's
well past midnight here. I'm on the east
side of the country right now. So
I'm going to say goodnight to you all.
Good chatting. Thanks for having me
Peter as always. And
I hope you all have a
great day and
be good to each other. Take care.
Thanks Ryan.
You're awesome. You make me look forward
to Mondays with having you guys on here.
So I really appreciate it.
Appreciate, look forward to what you do next
too. It's pretty exciting to hear what you and Trevor
are going to do.
Appreciate your time brother. Thanks.
Thanks for the feedback. And
yeah, nice seeing you guys. I'll
see you on IG and hopefully see you next week.
Take care guys. Cheers.
Well, that may
be a good point to
break because I also got to put my
three-year-old to bed.
All right. Always
great hearing you guys. Thank you so much for having
me. And
we've gone five hours and
20 minutes strong so far. So I think
we've,
yeah, I think we've covered
a lot of territory tonight.
Indeed. May I ask
Trevor if like I would love because I
did have a question about the
terpene breeding and maybe I'm going to send
you this paper on the back channel that
I've been, you know, I'd love to see
what people are thinking about.
It's like breeding for terpenes
is kind of a topic
that I know there's been a few different white papers
written on and maybe
that could be a conversation
because I think it also kind of ties
back into pest resistance
in certain genetics.
And I think that's a really good
topic. So I would be curious
if maybe that could be a part
of a conversation or a question that we could just
ponder or some of those white papers. Maybe we
could geek out on.
Yeah, totally.
You can send them to me
and or we can
yeah, we can. I've been
meaning to touch
base with Matthew Gates and
try and do a
actual like
breeding for resistance
type of discussion.
And this is one of those
elements of that discussion that
we could bring in there.
And there are also, there's like
there's a number of different papers.
There's the
Judith Booth papers from
2017, 2019
and 2020.
There's
a number of
Elizabeth Mudge
She's got
a couple papers and there
are
Livingston et al
2020.
Anyways, I've got a lot of the different papers
on terpene synthase
genes.
There's also information
and Ryan just had to hop off.
But
so it's kind of
controversial, but the
NAPRO did a lot of
the research that then
was used by
bio ink
biotechnologies
ink that or
molecular farms who
they got the utility patent
back in the day.
Those patents actually tell you
how to do a lot of this stuff.
So like, I mean, they're fucked up
and shit and I don't agree with the patents
that were applied for
by biotech ink,
but they lay
out the framework
for doing some of the breeding
for particular
cannabinoid terpene
targeted breeding.
So as fucked up as it
is, it does give some of the
it gives some of the
breeding scheme for how
you could do this if you wanted to.
So it's a resource
that's out there as well.
But we can
talk about all of that
on a future
breeders roundtable
and or a couple of them because
both of those breeding
for terps and also
breeding for
resistance are two huge
areas that deserve
their own deep dives
for sure.
100%.
Cool. Thanks, Trevor. I'm going to look
up some of those things you just mentioned. Maybe I'll
send you the one I'm thinking of specifically.
Awesome.
Cool. Thank you, everyone.
Have a great night.
All right.
London, do you want, are you there?
London calling.
No.
All right. Trevor, you want to close
down the room?
Peter, you have to
since you started. The person that's in the
upper left corner
in that first position has to close the room.
All right.
Have a good one, everyone.
Good evening, folks.
Hold on. I think
up and room. Yeah.
Okay.
Yes, but what
do you hear?
Yeah, you hear
a cricket.
He is in the garage.
He's my friend.
He hangs out. Let's listen to the
great.
What's he saying? Is he singing?
Yes.
Can you sing?
Okay. Let's you know
Christmas is coming. So
ready? The weather outside
is frightful.
But in the garage,
it's so delightful.
Let it snow in LA.
Let it snow in LA. Let it snow.
All right. Have a good night.
Say, have a good night, everyone.
Have a good night, everyone.
Say, I love you. I love you.
He stopped.
He stopped. Okay.
So let's think about
so tomorrow
we may
potentially be talking
about Russian
geneticists from
the Soviet era.
Although that might be
pushed next week.
London has some stuff going on.
And anyway, I'm going to
put her to bed.
Valentina, wait.
You know what?
Who drew that?
Me.
And wait.
I think you drew this one, too.
Me.
Yes, you drew that one, too.
Okay. Yeah.
Where did the cricket go?
I don't know.
Okay. So who's in this picture?
This one.
Yeah. Who's that?
That's me.
And then...
Yeah, the little one's you. And then who's that one?
That's right.
So in this one...
Who's in the middle?
Mama.
No, sit down.
And who has a big belly?
Who has a big belly?
Is this my belly?
Yeah.
Is it big?
Okay. Alright.
Dad, where's the cricket?
You know what? That's a good question.
Do you want to go over there? I think he's behind the fridge.
I don't hear him.
You know, I think the cricket's a little scared of us right now.
But why?
But why are you scared?
Well, because the cricket is this big.
Look at me.
Yeah, the cricket's like this big.
And look how big you are.
So...
If this were you...
And you saw a giant, would you be scared?
A little bit, yeah.
Why is he behind the fridge?
I don't know. Here, come here.
Come here.
Okay, say goodnight.
Say it's time to go to bed.
It's time to go to bed, everyone.
Yeah, say everyone go to bed.
Everyone go to bed.
Yeah, it's past your bedtime.
Yeah!
Okay. Alright.
Goodnight, everyone.
See you soon.
I'm scared.
If the cricket sees me, I'm gonna be...
I'm gonna be too scared
if he sees me.
You're gonna be scared if the cricket sees you?
Yeah. But you're so much bigger than the cricket.
But I don't want to see him.
Okay.
You don't have to see the cricket.
The cricket only hangs out in the garage
with me.
Unless I forget to close the garage door
and then sometimes he comes in the house.
And who doesn't like when my cricket
comes in the house?
Mommy. That's right.
Who does not like my bugs in the house?
That's right, Mommy.
But we love...
That's right, we love bugs. And who loves my whiskers?
Me, me, me, me, me!
So come here. You love my whiskers?
And what do you tell...
And who doesn't like my whiskers?
Mommy. Yeah, Mommy does not
like my whiskers.
And what do you always...
Who taught you how to do that?
Dada!
I did not teach you that.
You blame everything on me and then I get in trouble for it.
Alright, so Mommy doesn't...
But what do you say to Mommy
about my whiskers?
Mommy, I don't like Daddy's whiskers.
Yeah, and then when Mommy's not around,
what do you say about my whiskers?
I say, Dada, I like your whiskers!
It's very cool.
Yay!
I hear crickets.
Okay.
Alright.
Goodnight, goodnight.
Have a good night, everyone.
I don't know how to get
to the movie theater.
Okay, alright, let's go.
Alright, bye everyone.
I like your new rug.
It's so soft.
Yeah, it's my new rug.
Dad, it's so really soft.
I'm making the garage cozy.
Dad, this rug is soft.
It's a cozy garage.
Dad, this is...
