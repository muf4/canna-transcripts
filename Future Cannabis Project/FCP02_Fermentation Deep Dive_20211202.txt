And we're live
Awesome, thank you
How are you doing tonight Jason?
I'm doing great. I'm doing great. I'm trying to get the
Live feed pulled up here so that I can
Answer questions as they come in
There we go fermentation deep dive
Right, and the room is open fantastic. I see Trevor and Ian and
Strong style and
Thai guy grows high
city soul shine growing and
Sunny Chiva and loyalty good to see you again. Thanks for coming my friend supreme grape. I'm sure loyalties and both
He's probably in this room as well. If not now he will be eventually I see Joe and Russell down below
Thanks again Tim and Abe Adam higher Cameron drew top Matt
Thai Stanley gravy good to see a gravy my hobby Sean Aidan Dan potent and Brent
Thanks everybody for joining. Welcome to the grow and tell we are live and we're going it's
December everybody
Welcome to December first grow until in of December and episode number 11 before I get going
I want to remind everybody that this episode is recorded and
is
simulcast and
archived for replay on
YouTube on the future cannabis project, so
Thank you to Peter and the future cannabis project for simulcasting and producing
Every week for us and getting this show
To a much wider audience as well as giving us the ability to archive these episodes so we can go back and
Replay them and listen to them and share them with others. So really really
Excited to get going tonight fermentation is a topic. I love
Fermentation I'm all about fermentation. I love fermentation. It's always been a big part of my life even before I got into
Learning about
Natural farming approaches and using fermentation to create inputs for my plants. I've always been big into fermentation
I've been always been a huge pickle lover
and sauerkraut
And obviously as I got a little bit older beer and wine
And some of the other fantastic things that you know, we wouldn't even have
If it wasn't for fermentation, so it's a tremendous topic and
Although we could spend hours and hours going down
multiple different rabbit holes about fermentation we're gonna try to focus mostly on
how
fermentation and kind of how it
is
useful
obviously in cultivation
And some of the ways that some of the things that actually happen within the natural plant processes
So we'll get in that tonight. I see Ben's joined us. Thanks for joining Ben. Good to see you again
It's been a couple weeks. How you doing Ben?
We cannot hear you can you get your microphone a bit closer
All right, let's try to get you to work that out because we can barely hear you
But thanks for joining man, I appreciate it as always good to see you
Oh, and it looks like we got Nick live on the video feed as well
So that's also fantastic
That means we are definitely ready to rock and roll. I can see Nick's downing his beverages getting ready to
Give us some fantastic
information
About fermentation, but let's go ahead and dive in
Yeah city I agree almost everything I feed my plants is fermented in some way shape or form
He's got that honey June
We're definitely to talk about teas tonight, which is actually above and beyond. I think agriculture tea is more near and dear
To
to Nick
Then I think some of the some of the chemistry and biochemistry and then other things we talked about it
Tea is really his true passion
So yeah, no, it's a fantastic subject. I'm really really looking forward to diving into it
So just a quick overview of what is fermentation, right?
Fermentation
Is a metabolic process that produces chemical changes in organic substrates
Through the action of enzymes we love enzymes enzymes was actually a topic
That we covered back in episode three and actually that was something I did with Craig
truster
It was an amazing mycologist
Craig was kind enough to have our conversation on enzymes with me that day Nick
You are not available for that one, even though we definitely wanted to bring you in on that conversation
But yeah, it's you know in biochemistry
It is narrowly defined as the extraction of energy from carbohydrates in the absence of oxygen in
Food production it may be more broadly referred to any process in which
the activity of
microorganisms
brings about a desirable change
To the food stuffs or beverage the science of fermentation is known as
Zymology, so there's actually entire science around zymology
maybe I should work on a degree in zymology because
Fermentation is definitely something that is super super interesting to me
you know, I
in microorganisms fermentation is a primary means of producing and then in denno scene
Try off
Killing this one ATP is basically right by the degree degradation of organic nutrients
Anaerobically, I know we actually use a lot of aerobic
Composting I mix laughing at me. I can see the facial
Expressions coming across so that's fantastic and there's a nice delay in the feed
So I have a chance to look up after I screw something up and then see that come through a couple seconds later
So it's fantastic
Humans have used fermentation to produce food stuffs and beverages since the Neolithic age
They have records of this stuff going back thousands and thousands of years
with fermentation
different fermentation practices
I think somewhere seven thousand to sixty six hundred in China
So they they definitely have been tracking fermentation
It's been a part of human history
almost as long as
Cannabis has right we they're now tracking cannabis back about 13,000 years. So
You know fermentation is something that seems to have come along a little bit after our Canada our love of cannabis
But it's definitely appreciated, you know, I myself came to understand
Primarily and I think a lot of people do as I mentioned earlier through you know for the primarily for the process of food
Preservation is the main way that I you know initially was introduced
To it, you know, it is the chemical breakdown of substances by bacterias by yeasts by other microorganisms
Typically involving
effervescence
And the giving off of heat because as we know
When those biological processes happen they give off heat. That's why compost piles get hot
That's you know, it's that it's that activity that's happening. So
Yeah, you know
fermentation is
something that is
Been connected with us and connected with myself and is definitely connected with everybody who's on this room
I know Peter was very excited. We were going to talk about fermentation tonight
And I know Nick has lots of awesome information on fermentation
So I'm gonna turn it over to Nick for a few minutes and I'm gonna grab myself another drink of water
All right. Thanks Jason for the introduction and I hope that everyone can see me and hear me
Okay, there's gonna be a little bit of a delay because I don't think I can have
The microphone on the computer at the same time that it's on on Clubhouse
Well, I mean I can but there's good there might be a little bit of feedback so
Yeah, I'm definitely looking forward to the episode tonight
You know talking about fermentation fermentation chemistry kind of is something that's been very interesting to me for a while both personally
And professionally in terms of what I've done in the past
I used to have a small little kombucha brewery that wasn't never got too big
But it gave me an opportunity to kind of play around with the science of fermentation
And as you mentioned earlier, you know fermentation specifically
Is this you know, what's important to understand about?
fermentation versus something like oxidation is
That fermentation you have enzymes
Whether they're you know from that host organism or perhaps a microbial culture or fungal culture. You have these enzymes that are acting on
certain substrates and they're transforming these compounds and during this process of transformation alcohol can be created and
Such as in the process of brewing kombucha, you know, if you're fermenting sugars for instance along with the tea leaves
there's going to be some chemistry there that gives rise to the production of
alcohol and in a balanced kind of ecosystem that alcohol can actually
Be oxidized and kind of you have this cycle of reduction and oxidation happening
Which is actually why they referred to
scoby cultures and kombucha
As symbiotic culture of bacteria and yeast that's the that's the what scoby stands for so you have enzymes
coming from two different
Types of organisms and these they're acting in concert with each other
So the substrate material that's being broken down in the case of fermenting tea, you know, you add sugar to it. You add some tea leaves
depending on the amount of sugar
They introduce along with the type of tea that you introduce you're gonna have some differences
in the final product and overall how
Dominant culture is and either aerobic bacteria or yeast. So if you have black tea, for example
Black tea is fully oxidized
So, you know just to kind of back up one step when they're out there in the fields and they're plucking tea or if they're
Out in the middle of Yunnan and they're plucking the poor
You know, it's that tea once it's plucked can be transformed to any number of styles of tea
You can make poor out of it, which is an actual fermented tea
You can make white teas which are minimally oxidized. You can make a green tea, which is very partially oxidized
You can get what's called a yellow tea
Which is similar to green tea processing in a lot of ways
And if you continue this oxidation of the tea leaf, what happens is you get oolongs eventually?
There's a couple other steps that are important too
But by and large for the purpose of talking about degrees of oxidation here
Black teas here in the West we would say is a black tea
But over in China, they refer to it as red tea
So it's a little bit different but the idea is that the black tea is fully oxidized already
So if you use that to start your kombucha culture
The fact that it's been fully oxidized already is going to bring out a different kind of flavor
Culture of bacteria and yeast whereas if you use white tea, which is fully unoxidized
You're gonna have more fizzy kombucha. You're gonna have something that's a little bit lighter overall in its taste profile
but you know more specifically the microbes and the
Fungus and the yeast that make up that culture are going to be predominantly shifted towards ones that can process
unoxidized compounds found in tea
And you know making kombucha is not the only way that
Tea is fermented if you look at
Categories of tea as I mentioned, there's a category called hey cha, which is just
You know fermented teas post fermented teas. So this does require the introduction of
Bacteria and in some cases you have an actual fungus
There there's really really good tea out there that
Is inoculated with a fungus that blooms inside of compressed tea cakes and when it blooms it spreads golden spores all over the place
These golden spores end up transforming certain compounds that would otherwise be bitter and astringent in the team and they transform them into
Something that's very soft on the palate something that you wouldn't expect
But it's a very good tea. So that's the first category
Into
Something that's very soft on the palate something that you wouldn't expect
Because the the color of the tea itself is darker than coffee even I mean, it's like used motor oil jet black
you know, but you drink it and it's like the
Smoothest mouthfeel you could ever imagine and again
It's because this fungus in this specific case
The fungus is acting on the compounds in the tea that typically make it taste bitter give it some astringency
There's a molecular breakdown that's happening in this actual fermentation process
And I think the important point to understand here is that when in the case of aged teas like poor or other post fermented teas
They're not wet, you know, they may be steamed in the manner of pressing cakes
For instance when you need the tea leaves to behave a particular way, but by and large
Especially with raw poor it's not you know, they're they're minimally
They're they're kept minimally wet
And so really the microbes are dependent on more dry environments and it's about how you take the tea leaves through this process of transformation
You know, you have to let them dry in the Sun. For example, that's one of the characteristic
Features, you know, it almost seems to like activate the energy of this tea
And then as you go through a variety of processes to end up eventually with a pressed cake
Or poor, you know, even if it's loose leaf tea that tea can be subject to transformation over the course of decades 10 20 30
40 plus years and the longer this tea ages the more smooth it becomes and in some cases if the storage conditions are
Correct, then the complexity of the tea also increases quite a bit
so you have this real profound thing that happens where you have a dry cake of tea and
10 20 years later
It tastes a lot better. It has aged very well over time and the compounds that are in the tea have
Been transformed
So this process of transformation I think has besides tea and all that, you know cool stuff
Which I absolutely love to you can see my little teapot right here
the the process of transformation on
Some compounds besides just tea has kind of defined human culture for a very long period of time
even if we go back to the very beginning of agriculture, you know, there is strong evidence to suggest that some of the
Grains that were first cultivated
Humans had to ferment them because if you're you know, trying to use grains to make things like bread. There is this process of
Fermentation evolved you have to make sourdough bread. In other words, it wouldn't really make sense for
early
Our you know early ancestors that were exploring agriculture at first it wouldn't make sense for them to
Grow up a bunch of crops that they couldn't really digest very easily
you know, they're hard to break down in some cases and you really just need to
Expose it to the right microbes and the right fungus to kind of
You know get the nutritional and beneficial qualities that you're looking for and besides grains that are used to make breads
We also have chocolate which is one of the oldest
Fermented goods. It's definitely a very very interesting process for those of you that are unfamiliar
although somehow I doubt in this audience anyone would be but at any rate the process of
Making
Cacao and chocolate is fascinating because it does involve
Fermentation and specifically this fermentation transformed something that would otherwise be
You know largely inedible or very hard to eat
into something that is not only edible but has
nutritious benefits to it, but it also has some kind of
Psychosomatic, you know, there's a brain-body connection there
there's compounds that are produced as a result of these microbes doing their thing that are
You know go above and beyond nutrition and benefit for humans in other words, there's some medicinal compounds that could be created
or this in this process of transformation we may actually
Get the molecules out that we're looking for that are otherwise inaccessible
to kind of take it back one step as far as what I'm talking about think about when you have your
fresh cannabis plants and you need that THC a to
oxidize
Although we're not talking about enzymatic activity and fermentation here
The idea generally is that if there's a chemical reaction that can occur
That chemical reaction can improve the bioavailability and it can improve the efficacy of something
So the same thing applies when we're taking a microbe and we're having that microbe act on a particular substrate
Doesn't matter if it's grapes for wine making honey for me making rice for sake making tea for poor making or other
types of HR
This process of transformation ultimately produces compounds that end up being a lot more beneficial overall I think than the
initial compounds were that you started with and I guess what's interesting to me kind of in closing before I pass the
Mic back to Jason is you know, particularly with tea making because I'm very much so into tea
just
Being able to like understand that there's a very for thousands of years now people have been developing processes
Specifically around fermentation and it goes to very specific and precise
Levels of detail and so to me it's fascinating that some of the oldest connections that we have to agriculture actually
Revolve around fermentation and they are pulled from fermentation. So it's yeah that that's very interesting to me. And with that I am done
Thank you, Jason
Yeah, yeah. No, it's really interesting. I was when you were talking about that
Transformation of the stuff that's you know, 10 years old and some of those things it I was think, you know a cake
Right, I'm thinking about hash, you know and hash ishin, right?
It's that
It's that
Transformation that happens to that product
Partially through the processing but also through the aging for that hash ish
That hash ishin to really come out
And that's you know in a way probably some type of a fermentation process
I don't think we call it a fermentation process, but in some ways it probably could be considered a
fermentation process because the way you're getting the transformation of those
Basically of those that entity, you know, there's those trichomes and the values there. They're flavonoids. They're
Trichome heads there all the terpenes they're changing based on some
enzymatic or bacterial process that's causing this to happen so
Really really interesting tie-in and then you brought up one another one of my favorite
Fermentations, which is sourdough bread right the making of sourdough bread is really interesting
You take grapes
and grapes themselves
Everybody knows you ferment grapes to make wine right but grapes grapes are almost
self-fermenting they're
incredibly interesting because they their natural growth has
The yeasts naturally occur on the grapes themselves that will encourage this fermentation process
And so when you crush those grapes
That's almost all you have to do other types of alcohol you usually add sugars or other things in there
But when you're dealing with wine
Many times you're just crushing those grapes and the action of getting those sugars that are on the inside of the fruit
Combined with those naturally occurring yeast that are growing on the outsides of the grapes is what makes wine
makes wine happen and so that's really cool and
similarly though when you're making a sourdough bread you actually start by
capturing and utilizing those natural yeast that occur on grapes and
You put them into a baggie like a tea bag almost
And you you basically you're putting them into that flour water solution for several days as you start to build
up
The lactic bacteria and and some of the yeast and some of the other things that are going to live in that living
sourdough
Starter basically and that sourdough starter is a living ferment that you have to take out and feed
And keep it alive or it will die on you
and
You know, this is one of the things that I'm really fascinated me about, you know, the crossovers between
cooking and
Some of the natural farming techniques like labs lactic acid bacteria
We use lactic acid bacteria because it's fantastic for helping with plant health
And fighting off pathogens and and some types of like powdery mildews and things like that
and and and lactic acid bacteria is also
The thing along when combined with yeast that makes bread rise
So there's all these really really interesting combinations and that fermentation process is
Where that magic happens and brings out all these natural things. So really really cool crossovers there
I love sourdough. I have a sourdough starter actually just fed my sourdough starter
Two days ago. I had it out and you know fed it some fresh flour and water and let it grow and
Bubble up and then whipped it
But
You know it it's it's a great great process it's a lot of fun
I I really found it a lot of fun to make that sourdough and to get it going
Yeah, actually interestingly enough you can I
Once made sourdough I kept my sourdough culture alive by feeding it kombucha instead of water
Basically, and so I would I would use the bacteria in the yeast from the kombucha mother cultures
And I would introduce them
You know to a pretty high quality wheat and it ended up making really really good bread
The aftertaste was a little bit like tea
I used a more floral oolong tea that had like this really buttery smooth
Kind of mouth feel to it and I actually didn't come across in the bread
It was very interesting
But you also mentioned something interesting a bit earlier that I think is worth
Pointing out and bringing up which is that in a lot of times in particularly in the right?
Environments like if you're growing apples if you're growing grapes if you're growing anything any kind of fruit
That is ultimately destined for fermentation
It's very likely that the microbes and the fungus that participate in those reactions are going to be present on
That fruit as it's still alive and growing that whole outer layer is covered with a bunch of
Microorganisms that populate what's called the phyllosphere and so this population this micro
Biological population, you know, they produce
Surfactants and stuff. They want to stick on the outside of the apple surface
Just like any other critter that is just a millimeter away from an endless supply of sugar would want to be too. So
It's a very complex
Set of interactions and so I think if you're if you're actually if you got your own apple tree if you got your own
You know grape vines and you can do it that way
I think you're gonna get a really good result from wild fermentation. Just take really good care of your
Soil, make sure that the air is clean. You don't live in a really polluted environment
There aren't cars driving by right, you know, right by where your grapes and apples are growing and by and large
You should be able to harness those natural microbes on the flip side if you go to the store and you get some highly processed
Apples that have been sprayed and you know coated with wax and all that stuff
They're less likely to have those beneficial microbes and they're more likely to have pathogenic
Microbes at that point so it's kind of important
I think to also, you know understand that in some cases the fermentation this action that happens is
action
of microbes and fungi that the plants have known very well across their entire lifespan because they were present when the roots first shot out
They were present as the plant went from veg to flowering and they're present on the outside layer of the fruit as it
Matures and ripens and I think it's all part of the same process
And if you can keep that process intact from young plant all the way through, you know finished fermented product
You know, not only are you gonna have a really good story to tell but you're also going to understand, you know with clarity
How the human hand is involved in transforming?
Some of these substances that are in plants that do get potentiated like you were talking about with the transformation of mercine and tash
I mean these compounds can become stronger and there's countless examples of things like that
Actually, I think lycopene from tomatoes if this is just kind of an off-the-hand kind of remark
But I think that lycopene and tomatoes is actually better. It's more biologically active when it's been exposed to heat
So it needs to be activated a little bit to become functional
Yeah, I mean, you know cooking is another example of transformation
Maybe not so much fermentation
But there is some cooking that does occur for sure during fermentation if you're you know
Mixing the soil pile or whatever you have a nice little
compost pile go and compost bin
You'll see the temperature does rise and it's an exothermic reaction as some of this organic matter that's stored this energy that's stored
in the form of this dry composted plant mass as
These compounds are broken down they do release heat not only do they provide a
Substrate for microbes and fungus to grow in a very balanced way, you know
As I mentioned earlier in some cases with poor cakes
They can be dry and they can be aged for several decades and there's continued transformation over time
Same thing with wine
I think Nebbiolo grapes are actually intended to be aged for a minimum of
15 years 20 years before they're really consumed anything prior to that is considered too bitter
And it doesn't really do justice to what that cultivars capable of doing so yeah in some cases you have to wait a while you
have to
Apply a certain technique. You have to let microbes do their thing
There's you know, there's a there's a beverage I believe in South America that
Is also made more traditional in a fermented way
But there's microbes and it's a combination of microbes and saliva digestive enzymes and human saliva
And you introduce the microbes in the saliva and it sort of breaks the starch
Down and it produces alcohol and it ferments it in the absence of the saliva and absence of the beneficial microbes
You don't get the right kind of cultures that are growing
It's kind of very important to make sure that you have the right sort of balance of cultures overall
And with that being said, I'll pass it back to you Jason. Thank you
All right, we're at the 30-minute mark and Ben hasn't said much so I want to let Ben into the conversation
I know you love fermentation just as much as I do Ben
Very much. So actually it's ironic. I inadvertently ended up having Korean for dinner. And so I've been eating kimchi
Fantastic and fermented chili oil for dinner
But yeah
I wanted to touch back on something that Nick had mentioned and that you had mentioned about how you know
Like we're seeing is converted to enzymatic function into hashing
There's a lot of enzymatic function that actually happens just in the initial curing process of flower that a lot of people don't really realize
And I know that like myself included when we first thought about
Chopping and dropping plants you just think about you know, trying to preserve the terpenes and trying to preserve your cannabinoids
So you often go for this immediate chop drop and you go to dark and cold and you start pulling moisture as quick as you can
But some recent evidence, you know really showing that there's actually really important enzymatic
reactions that need to begin to happen at the beginning of that process to allow for full polymerization of
hydrocarbons and to allow these terpenes to actually
Combine into different ways because the terpenes that you have at harvest are not actually the exact terpene profile that you have at the end of cure
because there's a polymerization of these hydrocarbon chains and they actually
React with each other and with the microorganisms that are within the tissue and
It creates these different compounds that we're able to enjoy as a finished product that that's part of what really happens in cure
so it's really important actually at the beginning of the process of
harvesting to actually allow temps a little bit high higher than you would think and
a little higher than you might be comfortable with at first until you see the science behind it and
Then you drop the temperatures down after you know, 24 to 48 hours depending on cultivar and reaction
But it makes a huge huge difference in not just terpene preservation
but terpene expression
And profiles that are you know exhibited in the end product and I think that that really is exhibited in the same way in hash
And I think that though it's not necessarily what we think of as a traditional fermentation
Because we usually think of traditional fermentations utilizing moisture more often
as a control and as a microbial food here, I think it's almost like a
A
Desiccant version of fermentation where we're doing like dry fermentation because there still is enzymatic functions happening
but they're just happening at such a slower and smaller rate than we're used to and let's say like a lactobacillus and
You know when we've got that culture things can change within
Hours things can literally change within
Minutes to minutes. I did a class with Kobe who I see is actually in the crowd here
Listening in and we were in Tennessee and the temperatures were in the high 90s and
Humidity was in the high 80s and 90s almost every day and I was getting
rice water cultures that were turning around in 8 to 12 hours and
18 hours to 24 hours were passed and I had lack of a psyllus cultures that were
Forming and beginning to separate in the 8 to 12 hour mark and finishing in about 18 to 16 hours
Instead of the usual 24 36 it was it was absolutely incredible just to see how much
Influence that moisture in the air and the temperatures had upon the microbial activity and how rapidly that process was able to happen
It's what I think we see often in these
Hessian aging processes a very controlled slow
process of
Allowing those enzymes to create the types of final compounds that we're looking for
Awesome awesome and good to have you back with us this week. Thanks for joining. I appreciate you joining and coming
Coming in here
So it is as I mentioned right before Ben jumped on we did we did cross the 30-minute line
So I want to just take a quick second relight the room
Thank everybody for joining us here at hoat to herbs grow and tell this is episode 11
We're focused on fermentation tonight
Fermentation tonight, which is a fantastic topic
this episode as all of our episodes are recorded and
simulcast on the future cannabis project FC p02 channel
So if you are new
To the future cannabis project here on Clubhouse
Please make sure you click on the little greenhouse and join the future cannabis project. I was looking we're almost at a thousand people
We're getting close
So try to get your grab your friends
grab your family
Get them in here get them to join the future cannabis project here on Clubhouse
And then obviously as well future cannabis project and the FC p02
Channel both channels. Make sure you subscribe to those on YouTube
We've got a ton of awesome conversation going on on YouTube tonight
I've seen all sorts of different things rolling in
There's a lot of different discussions around distilling potatoes and for making different types of ferments
papaya pineapple and coconut ferment with bananas
That's quite a tasty combination. That sounds really delicious
Pulp the blueberries and mix with local soil and water and use the potatoes for further feed
interesting kind genetics
So we got all sorts of great lobster shell, yep lobster shells great
you know, I I wanted the
Fermentation like techniques that I like to use with some of those
Inputs because you know lobster shell is great
Oyster shell
Some of these inputs that people buy are fantastic
But they take a while to break down in the soil and they take a while for your plant to really be able to
Use it and so fermentation is actually a technique that you can use to try to break those things down
Faster and make them more plant available. So, you know we in the Korean natural farming world
We use oyster shells or egg shells with vinegar
to break them down at a faster rate so that they become they turn into a water soluble format and
That those products become plant available, but it's a quick it's a quick short
Fermentation it's you know only seven days
When one of the things I actually like to do is I make a fermented aloe
As opposed to just using a traditional FPGA all the time
One of the inputs that I like to do is a fermented aloe, which is same
Technique of making an FPGA you're combining aloe and sugar in equal weights
Chop up the aloe and use the entire aloe not just the core
but the outside structure all the cellulose and everything as well and
Chop that all up and then mix that with equal weights of sugar and then add
And this is where we vary from a traditional KNF FPGA
Instead of using a open lid for seven days
Like we would in a traditional Korean natural farming FPGA. What I do is a fermented aloe
So I actually add some a couple tablespoons of lactic acid bacteria and I use a closed lid
for 30 days
So it's a much longer fermentation process. It's a little bit more of a
More of an anaerobic process because it's a closed non breathing environment and
That
Produces a really really nice product that I like to use
in addition to the
FPGAs and you get some you get all those benefits of the aloe
And it also is a little bit of a wetting agent as well because you're getting some of those benefits from
Some of the outside of the aloe and some of the other products so a really really good way to speed up some of your
availability of
Different nutrients and inputs is actually to ferment them and to get them going
I see we've got ooh
Fantastic. We got potent panics us on YouTube
Getting ready for his show
That should be starting in a little bit. I
Appreciate seeing you on here tonight Steve great to see you as always
So, you know we we had a couple of
items that
You know, I think we wanted to highlight as well during the discussion, you know
we we have talked about how
Fermentation is an act of transformation
Right, it's an act of microbes and it's an act of transformation
But not all transformation is
fermentation
right Nick
You were talking about how the browning of an apple is
Oxidation as opposed to fermentation and I know you mentioned that earlier a little bit
Did you want to get into that a little bit deeper?
Yeah, yeah, and I think it's been kind of touched on a little bit earlier by I think Benjamin did a really good job
Describing how
Whatever is inside of a trichome head is something that doesn't just stay in a fixed position over time
it continues to change and those changes can be
Manifested by enzymes that are still in that trichome head because you got to consider wherever the terpenes and cannabinoids are being synthesized
Not very far away from them
In physical space exist the enzymes that actually do the work and so they're kind of you know
For lack of a better phrase they're trapped in there with the terpenes and cannabinoids when you harvest the plants
and so, you know depending specifically on which
Train of thought we're talking about in terms of like fermentation versus oxidation
I mean, there's a technical definition for fermentation as far as chemistry goes and specifically, you know the you know
it has to do with
You know plant plants for instance. They they want to use oxygen to
Be the sort of terminal electron acceptor
and so when oxygen is not available, you know in some cases they may
Seek out other alternatives and that's where fermentation could technically happen
But I think by and large because we're not talking about that granular level of detail
I think we can just stick a little bit more
generally speaking about the differences between what is like chemical oxidation and what is
Fermentation which could actually include oxidation as well. There are changes that are oxidative and reductive
So when we're talking about like browning of an apple, for instance, that technically is not a true fermentation
There's enzymes inside of the apple that kind of recognize that you know
Oxygen is a series of react reactive oxygen species are generated in the presence of oxygen
This enzyme will actually sort of break down some of the sugars and it promotes the oxidation. It's a interesting phenomena
So I think genetic
modification of apples
You know people are trying to remove that enzyme so you can cut into an apple and you can have the apple slices
But the apple slices will not brown in the presence of oxygen
Which I think is a little bit strange
You know, I'm not here to talk about pro or anti GMO
but it's just an interesting phenomena that people have kind of observed this that you can knock out certain enzymes that are
Responsible for catalyzing these changes and then you can more or less leave the the fruit intact or in some cases if there's enzymes that perform
transformational reactions inside of trichome heads then you can guide those you can guide that
Process now fortunately for you know, the purpose of controlling how cannabis matures you don't need genetic modification
That's probably the worst way to do it
The best way to do it is to understand what kind of changes happen and what are the parameters for those changes to occur?
This would include things like understanding how exposure to light exposure to oxygen
various temperature ranges humidity percentages in the air
Things like that. These are all equations that are very important in understanding how this
Speciation can occur and I think in the future once people understand a little bit with greater precision
We may start actually looking at you know doing things like I don't know if
Curing cannabis flowers in the presence of UV light pulsed on for 15 minutes and then off for 30 and you know
Something crazy like that
I'm sure someone's gonna experiment with and find out like hey, you know, the UV light actually goes in there and actually does something
Again, you know keep in mind some of these compounds that plants are producing are produced in response to UV light. Certainly I think
Cannabinoids can be one such example
Not to say that they're you know stimming
They're driven by it
But they certainly can be stimulated by it in in such a fashion that seems to suggest that
Cannabinoids could be effective sunscreens for very particular
You know nanometer
Ranges that the plants are exposed to just naturally and so the idea there again is in the grow room
You can add some supplemental UV light and you can get the plants to produce a little bit more
But what if something like that would be possible to achieve when you cure the flower?
You know this kind of takes us back to what I was talking about earlier with tea and how
Extensively documented these processes of transformation are and they have been for thousands of years. I mean you can take one plant
More or less, you know different cultivars depending on where it's grown
But you can process it into any number of different styles of tea that you want
I mean, I've I've had you know, all of the styles of tea have hundreds of different examples
I've had many different cultivars
Some are very difficult to find process in ways that are very difficult to achieve
and
It just always blows my mind that we're ultimately talking about one plant more or less that produces a very small number of compounds
There's like four catachins that tea produces that are you know?
These flavonoids are the ones that are modified and changed over
these processes of transformation and by and large most of these are
Internal chemical processes that are more accurately referred to as oxidation and then at a certain point with the introduction of microbes
That truly can achieve a state of fermentation you get this
post processing of whatever was created
You know because when you're making poor tea, for example
Or other post fermented teas you have to take the tea and you have to process it and you have to allow it to oxidize
You got to dehydrate it
These are all the same types of chemical reactions that occur inside of the trichome head dehydration I believe of
You know certain terpenes can give rise to others
oxidation of some
Terpenes can give rise to compounds like cashewnut
I think that one is a pretty good example of one and you know in the presence of light and oxygen beta-mercine will rearrange into
Hashening which is significantly more potent and so just looking at the particular
Circumstances of that transformation I think is really cool because you know
Cannabis is a very interesting plant in the sense that I don't think we have a
very strong understanding of how to
take this plant and to transform it in
The same number of ways as we do with tea, for example
And I think the best example I can give of that is you know
I'm sure there's flavonoids there in cannabis leaves that could be transformed into an actual drinkable beverage that has no
Psychoactivity and no THC, but you may find like it has a really pleasant effect on your stomach. It may actually
Be very soothing very calming may have therapeutic and medicinal effects
And I say this because obviously the trichome heads and the contents within are
Considered sacred and prized around the world for the therapeutic effects. So it makes sense that this plant also contains other
Substances that are not found in the flowers, you know, maybe it's in the leaves. Maybe it's in the roots
I think we were talking about this a couple of episodes ago
there are compounds found in cannabis roots that have been recently studied for their
Anticarcinogenic benefits which is true of other root vegetables to I mean turmeric ginger
You know these types of medicinal plants overall their medicinal compounds aren't just limited to a small area
They're at large to be found across the whole plant and it's our job
I think as cultivators of this plant to understand
Hey, we're not just trying to bring forward these medicinal compounds and flowers, which we should be but we should be looking at other ways
to
Bring the medicinal qualities out
And I personally because I love tea as much as I do
I really think that there's gonna be a market in the next couple of years once people learn how to process
You know organic hemp into actual tea that can be infused like an oolong tea
I mean
I want to be able to have like a special play pot much like this that I can you know
Keep my cannabis loose leaf tea and just brew it several times across the day because I know it's gonna do the thing that I
Want it to do
So this type of stuff exists for us to explore part of that exploration is the understanding of fermentation
Chemistry and where to apply microbes. We all know to apply microbes in the soil
These microbes have enzymes that help the plants grow, but there are instances where it's appropriate to apply the same microbes to
Plant mass that's been sort of dehydrated and we want to process that plant matter a little bit further
I hope I didn't get too far off topic there. Jason. I'll pass the microphone back to you. Thank you
No, not at all anything to add on to that
Ben might have stepped away for a second. I did but I am back. Thank you
No, actually, I think you really nailed that you said that really eloquently and touched on it in good depth
So
Awesome, so let's
let's move on to
Fermentation in plants, I think that's a definitely an area that we haven't really touched on yet
I see we've got somebody's got their hand up. Well, we'll have folks up in just a little bit Chris
We want to get through we got a couple other items on our on our agenda for the evening before we bring up
Questions and guests so if you just hold on to that question, we'll be happy to bring you up in just a little bit
so
I think the you know
The next topic I want to get into and you talked a little bit about it
You just kind of scratch the side of it, but this is a rabbit hole that we can definitely go down
but fermentation in plants themselves
Some of the actions that are in plants
You know that are going on in plants basically tools when the conditions are not ideal
Yeah, yeah and it's a you know, it's something that we wanted to touch on
Briefly so that people understood that there's fermentation chemistry that happens internally in plants, too
I think it's important because the majority of the focus so far has been on talking about, you know applying
Extracellular enzymes what happens when those enzymes are actually present within the plant what happens when the plant has the ability
to deal with
Fermentation chemistry. So I mean you've got to think in some cases like
plants that grow in swamps
Rice is certainly a crop that's subject to water logging and flood stress and things like that. So, you know in the grand scheme of things
It's interesting to look at those types of plants and see well, what are some of the mechanisms that they have to deal with?
the stressors that arise when when
You know when they get basically flooded out because the roots require oxygen they're just like human lungs
they have to breathe in oxygen and then during the process of ATP production and
energy formation for the plants
Oxygen is critical to act as the sort of the final electron acceptor and in some cases
the lack of oxygen hypoxia or a complete absence of
Oxygen which I think is anoxia those conditions can be
Brutal
to primary metabolic pathways that are
fundamental for all aspects of plant biology, so
Again plants have evolved
Evolutionary mechanisms to deal with it
I don't want to get too far into it because you know
It's a little bit out in the deep end and I'm not an expert in swamp plant chemistry, and I'm not an expert in
Anaerobic what happens, you know in the roots as a result of anaerobic activity after a long period of time
I know that there's plants out there that have mechanisms to help them deal with it because they can kind of you know
recycle they have ways of dealing with the
ethanol that's produced as a byproduct of
You know the fermentation reactions
But there's not really something that's meant to be a long-term strategy a lot of these plants actually can't survive
For more than you know six months to a year in the worst of cases and during that whole process
There's extreme changes that happen in the physiology of those plants you start to see crazy stuff like
potassium signaling for example to detect
You know because potassium regulates
Hydration levels in plants and it sort of can be responsible for trigger pressure and the opening and closing of stomata
So you start to see some pretty profound differences in potassium
Metabolism in these plants that are subject to water stress water logging and you also see some pretty profound acidification in some cases
You'll see plants produce
certain types of compounds on their roots and I think this is one of the things a lot of researchers are studying because
not too much is known about the specific like fermentation chemistry and sort of the
transcription factors that regulate all of that, but what is known is that there's
There's the ability for plants to produce compounds that would act to hold oxygen in
So even if in the case of you know, then being completely flooded and submerged with water
They have this coating this substance. Maybe it's a polysaccharide of some kind that hangs out on the outer layer of the root cap
but the substance will function to actually suffocate the roots and it prevents the water from coming in and just flooding and it prevents all the
Oxygen from leaving which is really the primary goal
And so when we're looking at plants that have like more or less mid to long-term survival strategies
you know for that those are the types of things that we would be looking at but
Yet, I didn't you know, I didn't want to get too far into it
but I thought it was really important for us to understand that the
Fermentation in terms of its chemistry is not just this outside in thing that the plants actually in some cases
Even though it's highly conserved and highly regulated. They have the ability to produce
enzymes that
Help them help them deal with all of these problems and produce alcohol sort of as a byproduct of it
So yeah, I hope that I hope that covered it
Yeah, no, that's really cool
I know when you mentioned it to to me earlier when we were we were going over this
prepping for for the episode this week I
It was it was interesting because I never really thought about fermentation processes inside the plant
I'm always thinking about what I'm doing to ferment stuff to put on the plant and
or fermentation as a way of building soil health or
you know other other
types of
using fermentation for composting for instance
You know that was those those are more the the types of approaches and things obviously and fermentation around food
which has always been my biggest focus, but
Yeah, no, I think it's really really interesting that there is
you know fermentation going on inside the plant itself and
Especially in these cases where they're trying to deal with conditions as a tool
To deal with conditions when conditions are not ideal
Yeah agreed I actually had never thought of that either in that particular manner and
As soon as you said it it makes perfect sense and I mean actually where I live in New England
I live right on the edge of
wetlands and borderlands of swamps and
You can actually really tell even just in the plants that you see growing in that area. They always have this
Extremely waxy cuticle even to their above soil parts, which is it makes perfect sense now
Yeah, I guess it's interesting, you know in some cases the compounds that the plants produce
They're sort of in some ways. I almost feel like they're produced with the intent like plants have this sort of
Understanding that these compounds will be then
Passed on to microbes or fungus to continue the process of maturing that compound that carbon-rich compound. So
It's very interesting to think about that in the context of plants that take a long time to grow
You know, not only plants that are subject to
Anoxic conditions that give rise to fermentation but even you know sort of completely off topic here
Just cacti and plants succulents that grow typically pretty slow
We can look at their internal metabolism and see things that in other plants like in c3 plants and c4 plants
You may have some some cycle going so fast that it's impossible to really slow it down and kind of look at like well
What are the individual steps? Whereas if you have these plants that are subject to crazy stress like cacti are subject to
insane amount of stress
The absence of water rather than too much water, but nevertheless, it's such an extreme
That it gives us an opportunity to look within them and say well what's going on?
And you know, fortunately, I guess you could say these plants do their thing. So slowly
As it is the case with cacti they grow fairly slowly
And then the same thing is true of plants that
Like exist in swamps and and things like that. Generally speaking. I think when they're waterlogged their their metabolism goes way down and
In studying those plants in that state where they're waterlogged
You can see things happening very slowly in the plant and you can see these
Adjustments that is trying to make because it takes so much longer to deal with that stress
And I think in some cases even plants that are subject to water stress
There is such a thing as them not being able to recover. I know that there's been some studies done
I think primarily on rice and
Maybe some other crops too, but they're trying to kind of figure out like well
how much is too much as far as the water logging stress goes and
When they're looking at these, you know inside of the plants the things that should be turned back on the process normal
but metabolic processes
That should be turned back on in some cases. The damage is so severe that it's
Irreversible the plant can no longer correct it and so
Cellular death occurs, unfortunately, so forget where I was going with that, but just wanted to mention that real quick
Yeah, it kind of made me laugh a little bit because a lot of Massachusetts is swamp and bog
And
We definitely got plenty of water here in Massachusetts, I'll say that especially this year we had a ton of rain
And one day the rain in July. Yeah anyone. Yeah. Yeah. It was it was quite it was quite intense
All right, so
did
Was there anything else?
That you wanted to cover on that
Before we move on the last item we actually had on the agenda and then we'll go ahead and open it up for the crowd
No, I mean, I think I'm good, you know, we may have forgotten to mention it to folks earlier
but you know, we're hoping that this all this
This conversation is opportunity for those of you in the audience who have maybe heard us talk a couple of times where you want to
Talk to yourself about fermentation chemistry
We were kind of hoping to have more people come up just because it seems like for the most part
We have these very long conversations that take an hour and a half and two hours and then you know, everyone's about to go
So yeah
Yeah, so
Absolutely. So the last thing I was gonna, you know get into tonight was a little conversation around bakashi
But I I think absolutely it is
10 o'clock
So we'll go ahead and you know relight the room
We are here. This is ho to herbs grow and tell so welcome. Welcome. Welcome everybody to ho to herbs grow and tell
This is our weekly cultivation club
Meeting we're here every Thursday night at 9 p.m. Eastern 6 p.m. Pacific
I'm usually joined by my friend and co-host Nick and Ben has been jumping in a few times
as always we are being recorded and
simulcast and
archived
through the future cannabis project
YouTube channel
So, please feel make sure that you go ahead and subscribe to both the clubhouse and future cannabis project YouTube channels
So that you're up to date and there's a whole bunch of great stuff going on on the future cannabis
Project channel and the FCP o2 channel
You can get state of cannabis news hour is actually being broadcast on there every day
There's a great new we had I think it was the the weed nerds
Yesterday was the cultivation group that we all got on and we're just answering questions
Popcorn style for anybody who had any questions. So that was a lot of fun
There's some amazing breeders roundtables that happen here
So check out all the shows on the future cannabis project not just Nick and me
And I know everybody's here to listen to Nick
Anyway, it's not really me
But I'm happy to have him on my show and use that as a way to get folks to come listen to me
So before I answer before we talk to Stephanie here who's joined us up on stage
I want to just mention bakashi because
Bakashi fermentation is also something that I love
I'm a huge fan of bakashi and bakashi is an as an anaerobic
fermentation process that has
Tremendous uses
And it is not as well known. I think by folks here
Necessarily in North America as much but it's really really really widely used around the globe
especially in Asia and
basically bakashi is primarily a process of taking grains and
using
most people make bakashi using EM or EM one which is a consortium of
bacteria and
different types of organisms
There's a I think purple of purple phosphorus bacteria in there. There's lactic acid bacteria in there
there's a bunch of different types of
Bacteria that work really well together in a consortium
Some people do just straight lab to make bakashi from
But tradition most bakashi is actually usually made from this kind of consortium process to make bakashi and you mix
molasses
as a food
with these microorganisms and some water and
Grains
And then you put them in a big trash bag or some airtight container
and you ferment them basically for 30 days and when you're done what you get out is a
This fermented grain a lot of people use bran as
as a as a as a means but you can use lots of different grains to make your bakashi from and
That product that you have after that 30 days you take it new you spread it out and you dry it
And then you have this really really amazing
composting material that you can use
for
Breaking down stuff and as we were talking about a few minutes ago. I'm in, Massachusetts and
It's a little hard to do
Hot or thermophilic composting in the middle of winter in January and February here in, Massachusetts
I actually like to do bakashi composting instead
and so I have a couple five gallon buckets that I
will take my coffee grounds and tea bags and tea, you know used up tea leaves and
Vegetable ends and all those other things that I compost that I would normally would compost
And I actually put those into a
Five gallon bucket actually several five gallon buckets because it's about one five gallon bucket a month
And as you're putting it in there you layer a little bakashi
Put your food waste a little more bakashi and you keep building this layer up and when you get to the top you put a
Nice, you know you use a good
plastic or something to squish that down and to get make sure you get all the as much of the air out of there as
Possible and then you seal that bucket up for 30 days when you're done
that material can then be
directly put into
the ground into furrows like right into your beds and it breaks down at a
Tremendously faster rate the eggshells they come out almost soft because they're pickled, right?
You basically are fermenting your pickling
The your food waste so that when it gets introduced into the ground
It breaks down at a really really fast rate like within a month as opposed to other times where that you know
Eggshells can last a really really long time in a compost pile if you just naturally throw them out there
But when you use bakashi and things like that you pickle them another cool thing about using bakashi fermentation is you can ferment anything
You can use it on meat. You can use it on cheese
You can use it on other things that you wouldn't normally put on a compost pile
Which is outdoors
Partially because it attracts animals and can cause other issues with your composting process and when you're using meats and things, you know
Animal products and stuff like that. You really want to bring temperatures up and heat that to kill off any bad
bacteria and pathogens and things like that, but with bakashi
You can do the same process
With cheeses and meats and all those other things and put them in there and they will also break down in a much faster rate
So it's very cool
Bakashi is used in many parts of the world in bathrooms as opposed to using
You know water or other things
There's actually restaurants where they use bakashi in the restaurant in the restrooms of those restaurants and it completely eliminates the smell
It allows and and basically the fermentation processes what's breaking these things down?
So bakashi is really really cool. It's got all sorts of other inputs into
making
you know either composting stuff or other types of
Processes so it's a really really cool
Fermentation
That is a great way to do composting when you're not necessarily able to do
traditional composting styles
Oh, yeah, see Iria, yeah, he's got the miso so miso is also another fermentation process
Miso is used in a lot of Asian cultures for doing fermentation
They will use the miso and this it's basically a bean curd
And use that bean curd and the enzymes and the bacteria that are part of that bean curd to ferment vegetables
And and fish and other things so that's also a really really cool tasty fermentation thing
So, yeah, no awesome awesome stuff fish sauce is another fermentation we already mentioned
kimchi earlier
There's a lot of Asian
practices that
Have to do with fermentation. So very very cool stuff
Anything to add on
On the fermentation topic tonight Ben. I know you got a bolt out of here earlier before you
Before you jet out on us
No, I mean when you go to the end and you start talking about fish sauce it immediately makes me think about making FAA and
Takes me back to eating the delicious delicious FAA that I have
It's a surprising process, I mean you think about taking something like
Raw fish and mixing it with a little bit of indigenous microorganisms a little bit of leaf stuff
Possibly a dash of compost or soil and then you leave it in a cooler layered with brown sugar
Or you know six months to a year and then you
are end up
End up with this wonderful dark liquid that smells kind of like strawberries and tastes like teriyaki
And tastes like teriyaki and it is a phenomenal fish amino acid
That you can utilize as a great nitrogen source as well as trace minerals and micro macro nutrients
It's really a fantastic complete process for fermentation, but it's just it's one of those things
I find that fermentation takes these concepts that we think would be absolutely horrendous and it converts them into these wondrous
delicious incredible
Creations. Yeah, the whole FAA process is absolutely
I
Think most of us kind of reject it in our heads when we think about you know
I'm just going to take a bunch of fish
And not really the good parts of the fish. I'm going to take all the other parts of the fish
I'm going to take the tail and the spine and the head and
A bunch of that other stuff and mix it with sugar and stick it in a cooler for six months
And then that's going to produce this really amazing liquid that smells like strawberries. Like how does that work?
That's just it's crazy stuff, but it's really really cool
A lot of it actually has to do with what we recognize is having that putrefaction smell
And they're really rotting disgusting smells from things like
animal products fish products is the putrefaction of
High condensity fat and one of the things is when you utilize something like imo
You've got fungal bodies in there that are just you know fat devourers
So they'll actually start breaking down and me
manipulating those fats into amino acids and
That's really what actually ends up doing the conversion set
You'll never even smell it. I've had faa in a cooler. That was a couple months old and I had no idea
I was sitting five feet from the dinner table while I had dinner at a friend's house until after dinner and he's like
Oh, look at that. What's that? No, guess what it is. How long it is smell it and I was like, there's no way
there's no way and
And uh, lo and behold we'd been having dinner next to uh, some nice nice salmon play or at a play carcasses
That he'd been fermenting for the past four or five months
Awesome stuff awesome stuff
Nick any final thoughts to wrap up before we open up the floor and talk to stephanie and chris who joined us
No, I mean, I think that was a great little way to finish it. Um, I really like how you got into enzymes there
Specifically with this concept of transformation. So yeah, i'm definitely ready to open it up and get some questions here
Fantastic
Stephanie, thank you for your patience. How are you doing tonight?
Hi boys, i'm good. I was just jumping in I was a little bit bored
So I thought I'd clubhouse surf tonight, but I caught the fermentation thing and I invited doug to ruin into the room
But i'm not seeing him down in the office. I'm not seeing him in the office
And I invited doug to ruin into the room, but i'm not seeing him down in the audience right now
But uh, i'm not sure if you guys heard of a product. I have been growing with it. It is phenomenal
It's vital humic out of canada. It's a fermented
Plant nutrient supplement. It's fantastic
So but they actually they did bio fermentation everything else in that so it actually helps with uptake of nutrients
Actually cut back on nutrients. You don't use as much
Yep, finding yields are increased by 30 percent terps up everything else
So it's a great product and i'm not the product specialist, but doug is
So I don't know if he's still floating around or I can get him back in here to talk about that one
But that's one to definitely check out as a grower. It's one that is tired and true with me. I use a lot. So
Thanks, stephanie. I appreciate that. Yeah. No, I um, it's yeah, it's definitely uh fermentation is a great way to get
uh
you know some of those um
Inputs to break down at a faster rate. I definitely mentioned that earlier on, you know
We use vinegar and and different things with oyster shell to get to get those
Nutrients out and to basically turn them into a water soluble format. So fermentation is absolutely super powerful
Yeah, doing those types of uh building out inputs and um, i'm glad you're finding success with that stuff
Yeah, it's good stuff. Yeah, just so they were you guys were talking about fish fish stuff and everything else, too
Socal we used to go get all of the stuff from catalina offshore products, too. That's their fresh fish waste. So
Yep. Yep
i'm not sure if anybody's down on socal but
And a lot of the stuff you can do yourself
You don't really even need to buy products off the shelf a lot of this fermentation
you can just do yourself at home like we were mentioning taking just some uh fish parts and uh
Throw them in the cooler with some sugar and you have a fantastic
Nitrogen and amino input so um, yeah
Well, even even down to your pet
I mean as long as you're not putting chemicals on your animals, but animals when you're brushing your dog or cat
They got their hairs full chuck full of nitrogen
Um down to making your own potash with your plant your crop residue
You know burn your stocks leach your ashes make some lye make some soap and then take your ashes leftover and potash
Awesome stuff. Thanks for joining us chris. How you doing tonight?
um
kia ora from aotearoa
um the native tongue for new zealand
Uh, welcome. Um, it's actually quarter past four here in aotearoa
So i've got five minutes before 4 20. So welcome you all at 10 o'clock at night 4 20 a.m
Living on the yeah. No, no, no i'm 4 20 in the p.m. I'm living in new zealand in the future
It's my friday today. Oh, okay. Yeah, I live in your future my friend. I live in your future and it's a great day
It's a great day today. So yeah future cannabis project and here I am from new zealand representing the future
so and I just like to say on the words of uh,
higher living organic green tea hemp
Which we have imported from sussex uk
Um, there is a green tea hemp with cbda written on the logo
It's a 15 organic green tea 15 organic hemp
85 organic green tea. It's uh packaged in sri lanka
You can get it in america through san antonio, texas
Imported by only natural products. So that is a higher living organic green
Hemp tea. I appreciate that. So we're very focused on fermentation though tonight as opposed to the
I do appreciate
I don't import it. I don't import it. I don't export it
I'm just saying that I use it and I'm currently a hemp farmer here in aotearoa
So I put all my mean and in my boiling water and I drink them in the morning when we're um
Because we're growing senza melia hemp here in aotearoa
So yes, all our boys, uh, they don't get fermented, but they do get boiled and uh drunk back
um, so yeah, just uh speaking on the fact that there is already a
cbda enriched hemp
Tea, um, yes, but we do also use the bakashi here in aotearoa as well with our buckets and you are right to the uh,
Calcium and the eggs just liquefying and turning into like a jelly. It's an amazing experience. It's so
It is and yeah, we have we have the same the same thing with the
food scraps to go into the smaller
Um, I don't know how many gallons it would be. I think it's a 60 liter bucket
So, you know, well how many gallons it is?
But yeah, so we do the same thing put all our food scraps into the bakashi bucket get that full
Press it all down stomp it down hard. Um get all the air out of it. And then yeah, once that's uh,
Settled for the 30 days. We then sprinkle it around add a little bit to our worm compost add a little bit just yeah little
the
Areas around the plot just make little pockets of bukashi nutrient rich
Um, yeah, so yeah, it's great speaking to that. Um, definitely using the bakashi and the methods there
So yeah, thank thank you for the room
Yeah, I was gonna say have you seen um, I know when i've put bakashi out
I get a whole like a big worm ball in that area like the worms seem to just love
Uh that they really kind of attack that area
That's why we put a little bit in the in the worm bin
And yeah, we do we do have the ability to um, take those extra aggressive angry worms and then spread them around the composting areas
As well, so they get taken out of the worm bin for being so eager and then uh get placed around the garden
Yeah, it's to uh separate separate the worms. Yeah, so thank you for the class. Thank you for the room
Oh, yeah, and thinking that thank you peter. Thank you. Everybody else from future canner's project
Thank you very much. Everybody else in the cannabis culture and yeah, jah bless one love and it's 4 18 now
So i'm gonna pick my cone and be ready for 4 20. Awesome. You all want a couple of minutes?
Fantastic, I love that. We're uh, we're coming we're coming from the other side of the planet
We got folks joining us today. So I really appreciate you. Uh jumping up here today chris and thank you for uh,
For the input I do. Um, I love seeing what the bakashi does with the worms and that you can't use a lot
Uh, because I think they'll they uh too much of it is they're going to kind of move away from it
But I definitely i've seen some some amazing explosion of activity in the places where i've dropped some
A little bit of bakashi. So very cool russell. How you doing tonight? You joined us up on stage
Hey, what's up guys
Any comments on fermentation sir, how you doing? Yeah good that guy was funny as hell the new zealand guy is funny. Um, so
Yeah
Jason was talking about, you know, I brought up fermentation with bakashi
And i've been doing like, you know little bits of it here and there in like, uh, you know the food waste pile
But you know, I have this big compost pile outside, you know
It's like a 10 by 10 like 8 feet high sometimes of just like all the yard waste, you know
I've just been like kind of lazy, but i'm just like been thinking i'm like man
There it's got to be a better way
to speed up the decomposition of like all of the yard waste like brand, you know, all these like
20 different species of plants that all are gnarles, you know, and it's kind of like
Just takes more time to compost, you know, i'm like
Just while you guys were talking I was like
What if you did I never thought about using bakashi in that pile. I was like, oh
Maybe that would help, you know facilitate the breakdown and I was trying to think of like
Well, how much would you actually need? You know, like on a 10 by 10 pile. Do you need like
Three inches of bakashi, you know what I mean? Like if every two every two feet or three feet, you know what I mean?
Yeah, I think part of the part of the problem is is that you know in general bakashi
When you're doing that fermentation, you've got an anaerobic process
So you're sealing off all the oxygen and and so when you're dealing with a large
outdoor pile of yard waste or plant material
Uh, you're not necessarily going to be able to create those same type of conditions to make the fermentation happen
Um, you're still going to get a lot of activity from
Microbial activity, but it's not going to necessarily have the same type of an impact
um, and um, you're also dealing with uh things like lignans
especially when you get into the hardwoods and
Lignans are extremely hard to break down. They're the probably the toughest of the plant materials to break down
What if you added like maybe would you added humics in there or something?
To help would that help?
Yeah, I I mean I think you you probably need to look I mean they do have um
There's ways that you can use, uh, you know biomass basically and and using uh, there's some large-scale
um
composting
processing that uh
One of our good friends on the future cannabis project light and morrison has been working on with uh, christopher
Yeah, yeah, absolutely and and so they're working with large large tremendous piles of green waste
right
um, and and one of the things that they're doing, uh,
to to aid in the breakdown is they're using a lot of um,
mushroom
substrate
as a compost
to help
push the
Fungal. Oh my god angle of the breakdown and then
Um, I believe he's also using some additional
Uh, like rock dust and minerals to help
Slow down and control the process because there's been
there's some changes in some of the state codes that are are going to be going into effect where
Um, you're not going to be able to actually dump food waste into landfills
Oh interesting, um, and so they have to come up with ways to deal with uh food waste
uh, and uh these other
Outstreams of material, um same thing with the cannabis industry
We have a lot of waste product that is coming out of the production of cannabis
Um, you know forget about packaging. I don't even want to talk about packaging. That's the nightmare in itself
Um, but just in plant material alone stems stocks
uh all the
de-leafed material
um used substrate
Cocoa all those different things. Uh, rock wool is a is a product that's not
Sustainable, right? It doesn't break down because it's basically rock
So we need to find ways to reuse it as opposed to
necessarily
Posting it or breaking it down
Um, so yeah, no, absolutely there there needs to to be some
Some improvements in the way that we deal with green waste in general
But that's that's one of the that's one of the things chopping it dicing it. No, that's the thing. Does anyone know?
That's I have a shredder but it's like someone needs to develop new chipper shredder technology
Where it's not just like a thin little port
It's like a mat you can just like dump it in and then think like a 10 by 10 plot gets shredded in like 10 minutes
It's like
And then I don't know. It's like I think a ship tripper shredder technology could be improved
for like more large-scale use
Or at least I don't know like on a homestead someone there's like
industrial grade ones and then there's just like
Smaller ones but not like mid-size homestead style ones
Yeah
There you go, there's a product you work with somebody try to get it developed right?
And I I think you know additionally because we talk about um hemp
Uh, you know hemp is an amazing product and and the you know hemp is an incredible industrial product
Uh, but there's still a lot of advancements that need to be made especially here in the u.s
To be able to actually utilize all the hemp that's being grown in industrial fashions
Uh decorticators
systems to pull the herd for
uh hempcrete
Things like that and unfortunately because of a lot of the resins that are present in the plant itself
They clog machines like you wouldn't believe. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yep. Yep. Yep
A little a little far off topic from fermentation, but you know what speaking of fermentation vermicompost
I mean you guys cover vermicompost. It's not I guess it's I guess we're getting off topic because that's just like biological
That's yeah, I I definitely would agree there's probably a whole lot of fermentation going on within that worm bin
Of some of those things and in general worms aren't really eating the food. They're going after a lot of the biology
Uh, and some of the molds and funguses and things that are growing on the food is getting broken down
So anyone ever put vermicompost?
Bokashi in like a worm bin. We were just talking about that a little bit earlier. Um, it I I get a tremendous
snowball, uh when I do that, oh and we've got
only a little
Fantastic. We got steve raisner up on the screen
Uh, so so steve, I do not have like a show in like five minutes
I do I do but i'm still waiting on people to connect and i'm very much a fan of your show
I often listen to it on fridays after i'm done mine
Um
Wonderful. Wonderful. I really really appreciate you being here and and and um, I sent you a message on the back channel
Uh, we'd actually love to have you join us next week when we talk about kelp
Um, so we're going to be doing an awesome episode on kelp and nick and I were talking and i'd love to have you
Join us for that conversation. So feel free to uh, hit me up on the on either instagram or whatever
We'll have a quick chat about uh next week
Um, so awesome, uh, yeah, no, so steve if for folks that don't know
Potent ponics growing with fishes podcast is going to be kicking off and it is a
extremely long running show
uh and
Tremendously informative for folks in in cultivation, but especially
Uh in the aquaponics community, so I really appreciate you being here. Steve. Thanks
I just wanted to add to what you were saying on the lactobacillus
Uh university kentucky state did a study on lactobacillus in terms of how it affected plant growth and fish growth in aquaponics systems
And what they found is not only did it increase fish growth rate by 15 to 18 percent
An increased plant growth rate by 17 to 24 percent depending on crop
Um, so it made an enormous difference and part of it had to do with the vitamin b uptake
But one of the weird side effects was they happened to have a non
pathogenic e coli
A soil e coli that's normally part of the soil environment was completely eliminated
And since then we've gone on to use labs to treat e coli and salmon e coli specifically. I can't speak on salmonella, but e coli
We've managed to eliminate that from three commercial facilities without bringing them offline or affecting mineralization in a negative way
So lactobacillus in my opinion in you know, five years from now is going to be required
dosing for food safety protocols for any hydroponic and aquaponic facility
to prevent human pathogens
As part of a food safety protocol
One of the other things I was going to mention too with the labs is that if you diversify your lactobacillus species
You will get a better vitamin b expression
in your
Outputs which is going to accelerate plant growth rate
The more diverse lactobacillus species the more different forms of vitamin b you're going to have as a byproduct
And it's going to make a huge difference in terms of your actual
um
You know growth rates and growth response from your labs
The other thing I was going to mention is real quickly is super labs
so those of you that don't know about super labs of
normal lactobacillus except
When you add the combine the rice wash to the milk
You're going to also add some kefir grains
And then you're going to add in four gallons of milk
You would add the kefir grains or whatever your starter is and then you're going to also add
um
one to two pounds of spirulina
and then a quarter of that either a quarter pound or a half pound of
Kelp extract and ferment that up
together for 10 to 14 days
Longer than normal labs and you'll get isolate the phycocyanin which is your base building block for all your chlorophyll groups
As well as some other very important
plant hormones and auxins
out of those two
Ingredients and you can do all kinds of amazing things for healing damaged
plants plants that have been
Hit by hail plants that have been fed on heavily by insects or even plants that have been forgotten to be watered
And you need to kind of revive them. Um, it's very very good for all of those things
Super super dense packed burst of information
Greatly appreciated. Thank you. Any anything
I actually took notes. I was typing all of that down. That was such a burst of information. I seriously have it
Any additional comment on that because I know he mentioned kelp nick
We'll talk about it more next week and get into that maybe a little bit broader on that stuff
But what I wanted to mention is is that when you get into fermentation, especially lactobacillus or even liquid imo fermentation
Which I highly suggest if people want to learn more about that check out the episode
I did on my podcast with kwan kon fem. I believe it was episode 251 or 253. I don't remember which
The gentleman out of vietnam has had a lot of success long fermenting
with liquid liquid imo
different plant ferments the same way you would fpj
Except with liquid imo and then the plant input and he found after three months
They were able to get significantly higher total parts per million out of their plant ferments and plant isolates
compared to
Before three months and he's testing them weekly with hannah meters
A color spectrometer so he's getting brutally accurate parts per million readings
every single week on on all those ferments and it's something I think is kind of the leading edge in my opinion of
The fermentation research and someone I would love to to put you in touch with to try and get on your show
Absolutely. Absolutely. That's super interesting
um
Yeah, because again I I like to make you know
I make that fermented aloe and i'm putting lactic acid bacteria in with that aloe and i'm going 30 days
Um, so yeah, no, I absolutely uh, i'm really interested in in that liquid imo approach
That's that's super super interesting liquid. Imo is is my one of my main feeding patterns
Uh is brewing that you know
Imo liquid imo every week or so
And then that's the primary way I actually feed my plants most of the rest of the time it's just water
When you hear a lot about fbj and all these other stuff and ffa and all this other stuff
You don't hear much about liquid imo fermentation and I had never heard of it before I had him on my show and
It really gives you kind of a new tool
Uh, you know and different microbes that are doing different things isolating different compounds
um, then
What we've already been taught by master cho and some of the other wonderful people that have taught us so many things about this
Yeah, that's I I that that makes the timing and the capturing of the right
Of the liquid imo at the right time even more important I would guess. Um
So yeah liquid imo is an interesting so it's it's a compost tea brew for those that don't know. It's um
It's similar to brewing a compost tea
But you're making it with an imo instead of compost
And that imo is indigenous microorganisms and usually you're using an a uh an imo three or greater
In that process, um, in fact, it pretty much has to be an imo three or greater in that process preferably an imo four
Uh for a liquid imo and there's a little bit of uh, ohhn in there
So you have your oriental herbal nutrients, which is more of a tincturing
Than a fermentation, although it starts out with a fermentation process, which is also kind of interesting
Um, so yeah, no, that's that's super cool
I'm gonna definitely have to go back and check out that channel and please put me in touch with this gentleman because i'm
Super you totally have my interest peaked now
Specifically around aquaponics and soil from uh soil application, but he's trying to replace
All nutrient inputs with ferments
he's been focusing solely on banana tree trunk ferments and some other ferments that are
Maybe different than what the rest of us are working on because of his restrictions in his country
He doesn't grow cannabis
But he's on some different methods that I think are very different than everyone else
And having incredible results and he has the data to back it up
And there aren't a lot of people that have all of those things as well as a completely different direction as well
So it's he's a great guy to talk to
Fantastic
Um, i'm sure you got the crew starting your stuff up for you, but I know you got to get going again
Thanks so much for joining us. I appreciate your time, my friend
Put me in here and let me talk about your show and keep up the great education
Awesome. Appreciate that so much
All right, matt. You've been very patient. Uh, thanks for joining us tonight. What's on your mind?
Oh, geez, how do I work this? Oh, it's on
Um, i've got a question about using local shit
So it's more like using zebra mussel shells for ferments like water soluble calcium
uh using lake weeds instead of
Being able to get from the ocean and stuff
Yeah, they're all valid right? Um primarily when we do, uh, we look at
In korean natural farming and we choose the items that we're going to make our ferments out of
We're looking for the plants that are most the most successful
In the environment around us, right? What are the plants that are the most uh that are growing the fastest?
That have the most uh, you know life in them
Uh it at that time of the year
Uh in that environment and you're going to find a lot of plants that are
In that environment and you're going after, you know, those fresh growing tips
Uh those those those points, uh those tops
Uh where the where the most life is in the plant itself and there's the most juices
And the most moisture as well
when you're dealing with
water plants
You do have to adjust
Some of your fermentation process because of the amount of moisture
So in some cases you actually want to use less sugars
Um to try to make sure that your your batch doesn't come out too wet
um, but there's a lot of different, uh,
Applications and again, we're going to be talking about kelp next week
but there's a lot of fantastic applications with using water plants as a as a
Source of fermentation for making like a fermented plant juice or something
Yeah, that's that's when potent pond said said that I was like well that kind of leads into what I was gonna say
Yeah
What about uh pollution?
Like from boats and stuff like it has to be a concern
It has to be a concern. It's just like a live mulch like on outdoor plants
Um, you know just like you live like right next to the to the lake and you put it out
Do you pull it out of your out of the lake and throw it out on the bottom of your cedar plants?
I mean it would depend on how how how
Polluted that lake is I guess, you know, obviously you've got to be
Anything you put on your plants has the ability to end up in your plants
Especially like cannabis, which is a huge bioaccumulator
Um, it's gonna suck up heavy metals it's gonna suck up toxins it's gonna suck up, uh, all sorts of uh things and so
Um, you know, I guess it really just depends on the lake itself. It's hard, you know, I there really are no
Um environments on the planet that aren't in some way
um contaminated
right we
Um, it doesn't make a difference whether it's air contamination or water contamination or land contamination
There's tons of it out there. So it's really difficult to avoid
um
but you know, I wouldn't necessarily
Go down to I wouldn't pull it from the area of the you know, where the boat is normally docked
Right where that boat is sitting all the time and things might be dripping from the engine or you're constantly starting and pouring gas
In or refueling and things like that in that area. I might go to an area. That's a little bit less disturbed
Maybe an area that doesn't have a dock or isn't as used uh as used. It's a little bit more
Um, you know has a little bit more plants and a little bit less human activity
Uh might be the better choice
All right, thank you very much guys
And then you know it crossed my mind when you're talking about using
Fungal mushroom mushroom for breaking down compost and it's like then I thought about Paul Stamets
You know in the oyster mushrooms the inoculation of hydrocarbons
It's like maybe a fungal
Addition to that would be greed and I don't know
Have you seen fantastic fungi?
Yeah, that's a good one
right, um, you know mushrooms are
Breaking down that's what they do. That's part of their life cycles to break down other stuff
They're tremendous. Uh
composters
right
I see, uh, we've got uh, never winter farm sean. How you doing tonight? What's on your mind?
about fermentation
Doing pretty good. We have two questions. So the first one if you're going to make your own
um bokashi inoculant grain
Do you want to a substrate that's high in carbon or high in protein?
So I was looking at like the difference between say like a rice hull versus a wheat bran
Is one better than the other or should I make them with both of them together?
um, I actually when I made mine I used wheat bran and I did use a little bit of rice hull
and a little bit of barley
so
You can definitely use uh different combinations. It kind of depends on what you're trying to do with that bokashi
um, I have a
One of the gentlemen that I talked to when I was learning how to make bokashi
uh, you know he
um puts he create he sells a whole bunch of different bakashi inputs and um
the different inputs are actually he adds those
after the bakashi is made as opposed to trying to
make bakashi with
grains that fit a specific type of
Input you're looking to apply
Um, he tends to add those things to the bakashi after the fact so mixing some, you know, uh crab meal
or uh some uh
algae powder or some kelp or some kelp meal or
Some of these other things he tends to apply those after the bakashi is made as opposed to using that as part of the bakashi
creation product
Okay, and then on the second question i'm looking to use horses
Gain silica am I how do I know when I should use an fpj versus an fpe style ferment?
Hey, jason, not sure if you're talking your microphone is muted. Oh, yeah. Thank you. Sorry about that. Uh, what uh,
Fpe is i'm not as familiar with fpe. What is
I know fpj and ffj
So you have fermented plant juice
And fermented fruit juice
Uh, and those are parts of korean natural farming but fpe what is that a fermented plant enzyme?
It's fermented plant extract and so it uses like maybe a third
of water with also a third of sugar
And that would be done anaerobically versus using the sugar base extract
Yeah, i'm not as familiar with that type of a of an approach it's not a traditional korean natural farming fermented approach
I tend to stick with
fermented plant juices and fermented fruit juice
which are used fermented plant juice is used as
part of the growth cycle most of the vegetative
Part of the life cycle and the first half of flowering
You get into fermented fruit juice as part of the enhanced ripening phase
Of flowering and and that's really where those those second half of flowering weeks five through whatever
Um is where you're going to be applying an ffj as opposed to an fpj
But an fpj versus an fpe
Probably the same type of a thing that's going to be more of a veg
Food
So, you know, I like to keep them in, you know when I think
Fermented plant juice if it's an fp. It's a vegetative if it's a fruit an ff
Um fruiting is part of enhanced is part of ripening fruiting is, you know, the budding
phase so
Okay, that's all I had. I appreciate it. Yep. Absolutely
All right
Hey guys, what about what's your thoughts on this whole new fermenting yeast that the yeast are using to
create cannabinoids in petri dishes
You want to take that one nick
Sure, yeah, I mean it's one of those things, you know at large the topic and the discussion has been well plants are great at
synthesizing terpenes and they're good at making cannabinoids, but it may not be the most scalable thing according to some pharmaceutical companies if we're trying to get
um, you know, very large-scale production of these compounds so it may make sense to take like e.coli and genetically modify it and then
um have that produce the cannabinoids I I think it's it's not
It's not exactly the same. I mean the enzymes
there can sort of act in a similar way and produce similar compounds, but
um, there's
you know, just generally speaking our understanding of cannabinoid biosynthesis chemistry and even terpene biosynthesis chemistry is still
In its infancy stages of understanding and so we have a lot
uh left to learn before I think it's going to become a viable and scalable option for us to have these
you know genetically modified organisms that
produce these compounds compounds for us. I think it's kind of a little bit of a
It's a fancy thought experiment that is well funded
But ultimately at the end of the day, I think we're going to find that the plants which grow naturally and produce these compounds
They're the ones already farming it for us on a molecular basis and we don't really have to do anything
Much different except for figuring out how to best take care of them
Hear hear to that
See, I agree with you. But yeah, that's something that I see a lot because I I came from my vanilla life was medical
Pharmaceutical so it's I see that some of these, you know, these places out in socal
Demtrix, I think it is deemtrix
They've been doing it there's uh, what's the other one up in canada their stock prices just went through the roof like two weeks ago
They're doing it but it more or less is pretty much petri dish and growing it just like we do vanilla right now
But I mean they can claim it's all natural because it's actually being
naturally fermented from an actual plant
but
Yeah, I think that's something that is a shadow in the back of our industry that big pharma
I think is going to push for because I know that their platform is that oh, it's rare or it's it's consistent
It's scalable blah blah blah. So
That's just a thought that I have, you know as a legacy grower about big pharma coming in and doing stuff like that
They will um, you know, but I think in many cases as as as um
As more and more information as it comes out will show
that
Um, you're not going to get the benefits by isolating and so right if you go ahead and you produce these
uh specific and perfect versions of these
uh cannabinoids or or products you're you're gonna you're not necessarily going to get the
efficacy in delivery without the other components, you're not going to get the benefits, uh,
if you don't have the full plant and so
um
that's
um, that's I think going to be one of the
You know the achilles heels almost of a lot of the pharmaceutical and medical industries as they try to approach this
Uh plant for healing and medicine is that it isn't necessarily this isolatable
um
specific uh unique item that they can pull out that tiny little thread and then you know
Replicate it over and over again and it's going to be this miracle saber, you know
I I don't think this plant works that way. And so um, I think that's going to be problematic for them
it's also problematic for us obviously from a
research and from a um from a proof standpoint, right if there's
Thousands of compounds in there. How do you prove what's actually cause, you know helping people?
right
How do you uh, you know, how do you prescribe?
Uh if if it's difficult to isolate what works for people
So I think there's it's it's going to be challenging and I don't think anybody's got a free ride
Um, they can grow it on yeast all day long. I don't think that's going to help
Well, I think they actually got blockage too. I think filing for patents and everything else
I think they like I don't think they can actually file when you file for patents. You can't do something with uh,
Multi-cannabinoids you got to individually file for them. I think
Um, I can chat with bob and he's our patent agent but find out for sure
But that's what i've been hearing also too is that's one thing that they cannot produce in a petri dish is full spectrum
So yay for us
Absolutely
All right. Uh anything interesting on the youtube feed nick. I know you've been kind of
scrolling through there
um, I see uh
sentimental
Uh did an fpj using fresh sage
from the garden and uh on some cheese
Delicious, that sounds really really tasty. Um, you know, that's also one of the things I love about fermenting and
uh korean natural farming practices and and things like that is that that you know, these are
They're they're not only tasty, but they're really good for you, too
Um, you know extreme extremely good
Uh for your overall gut health and in many cases that's you know, gut health is going to be the thing that
uh is
the true place that a lot of these
Companies should be looking to try to help us get around these diseases and problems. We have it's the gut health. That's the issue
uh, the lack of gut health that is a cause of many of the problems that we face today in society and so
fermentation
And eating fermented foods is one way to help rebuild some of that gut biome
I mean probiotics or yogurts and things are created out of a fermentation process
So we do need
uh fermentation it's it's uh, it's part of uh,
Helping, uh, you know helping us, uh be healthy
Fermentation is naturally occurring in in our gastrointestinal tracks and and of all animals
Not just us all animals. It's it's a necessary
uh part of our uh function
I see dr. Lori has come up to the stage. Dr. Lori, how are you doing and congratulations?
Hey guys, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Guys, i'm just coming up to to give my support to this room and um
I am so
Amazingly proud of this room and everything that we do
um
Thank you. Jason for the congrats
and um as soon as
I get my labels and my white labels and everything i'll have it out, but
That's not what it's all about. It's about
Me being a medical patient and making sure that other medical patients are taken care of
That's what that is my whole
That's that that's the whole thing about me right now because I want to make sure that medical patients are taken care of
Yeah, um as a as a medical patient myself
I know i'm like I have to go through so
Many I gotta jump through hoops. I gotta jump over stuff and
Make sure that I have what I need as a patient
So I want to make sure that patients have that that also that opportunity as well. So
I'm just here. Um, i'm here to
Support jason. I'm here to support you guys in this space and I love you guys to life
I am so grateful to be a part of this community
And I am complete
And we love and appreciate you too. Dr. Laurie. Thank you for joining us tonight. Thank you for your kind words
um, very excited for you and your and your new opportunity with with that, uh property and
I'm, uh looking forward to helping also give you some great
Fermentation suggestions to incorporate into that farm as you get going
um and as uh as steve was mentioning earlier lactic acid bacteria think lactic acid bacteria because we're gonna
We're gonna get a whole bunch of that into your property and get that stuff going. So, uh, it's gonna be wonderful
awesome stuff, but look I got I got right now since
I haven't because you know, it's winter winter time. We'll getting ready to be winter time up here
Um, i've got my seeds in pots
At my auntie's house because auntie said why don't you have them seeds in no pot right here?
You need to put them seeds in the pot. I'm like
Are you serious?
That's my 89 year old auntie because i'm using medical cannabis to help her
When I got here, they told me she had three weeks to live in may
And it's now december the december second
And she's still here. She was like you need to put them seeds in a pot somewhere
I got seeds and pots here at her house and she was like I need you to put them seeds and pots here
I'm, like auntie. Are you sure?
She's like yes
So I got seeds and pots
Around here at the house. That's amazing. That's amazing. I love having the plants. I mean, I I you know
I'm a home grower. So my plants are in my basement. I'm always spending time with my plants
in between meetings at work i'll duck down there and go say hello and look at them and
So it's it's it's fantastic and and plants are healing
Not just cannabis plants, but having plants growing plants having plants around you in the house
Is extremely healing and extremely healthy for you
Both mentally and physically so I highly recommend people
Grow stuff, even if you think you've got a black thumb
Get some get some easy plants, you know get some cactuses get something
Get something green going in your house
All right, we are almost at 11 o'clock. We're hitting that two hour mark
uh
Nick any uh anything, uh interesting. I know you've been going back and forth. I see some rosemary instead of sage
um
some conversations around aloe
Yeah, yeah, they were just kind of uh conversations we had um pulled up from earlier people were talking about plant ferments and
It's interesting, you know as these I read these comments and people are bringing up these plants
I'm like, oh, hey, that's you know, I use that one for this and I use that one for the other. Um,
There was something that you brought up that I wanted to um kind of elaborate on just real quick and that was the uh
idea that the interface
For human health can really be uh narrowed and you know
Narrowed down to what goes on in the gut and it can be traced back to that. There's a lot of
conditions
Neurological conditions that can arise from improperly balanced gut microbiomes and maybe a couple of episodes
Ago, we had talked about this interesting idea that plants produce
compounds that are essential
For human health and for human life. We don't consider them
Macronutrients per se but we had looked at how the human eye has carotenoids
In the center of it which allow it to take in sunlight and not burn up
We had also looked at carotenoids in the brain
And if you become deficient in those carotenoids in the brain that irreversible cognitive decline does occur
And to kind of take that one step back in further and say well, you know besides the plant produced compounds. There's other
compounds that are produced and mediated by
uh beneficial gut
You know the microbiome inside of you and so if you take good care of
Uh the you know those microbiologicals they're going to in turn take good care of you and part of it is figuring out
Which compounds they respond well to and which ones they may not respond very well to I think artichoke extract is one those
fructooligosaccharides inside of artichoke have been shown to be massively
massively stimulatory for beneficial microbes and so for people that may have
You know questionable biological activity happening inside of them a little bit of prebiotic substances
prebiotic fibers prebiotic sugars
You know, these are compounds that when they get inside of your body
They can stimulate those probiotic cultures to actually come and to sustain populations for several days
But definitely, you know if there's one thing for everyone to take away tonight
It's this idea you should treat your own body like a giant bioreactor
And everything that you're putting inside of it is going to ultimately get fermented
And it's going to produce in some cases some noxious gas, which nobody wants to be to be anywhere around
but
You're going to liberate a bunch of
Compounds from the food that you eat and create nutrition for yourself where i'm talking about b vitamins i'm talking about
soluble forms of calcium even for your own body i'm talking about neurotransmitters like serotonin
And getting into like the the brain side of the equation, too
there's a lot of our cognitive perceptions that are based on what happens in the gut and oftentimes when our
gut is not in balance we do have
Difficulties maybe perceiving reality in certain ways
I know I personally can get brain fog as a result of having an upset stomach and it's not terribly uncommon for
That to be the case as well with other people. So
Definitely treat your body like a bioreactor and definitely treat it like a fermentation
Chamber and try to take good care of it
Yeah, I nick that's amazing all of that. I just like to you know for the record. I was super jacked by western
pharma uh
Antibiotics, you know, and so it's like a long road of healing
Repairing that system and I found for me goat milk kefir worked the best like raw goat milk kefir
And I was juicing fresh cannabis leaves at the same time like about a decade ago, and I was like a real trigger
And I was like those two those two together pretty magical
um
but yeah
The biome is key
Awesome
Awesome awesome stuff. All right, so
it is uh
Just about 11 o'clock. We've been going for two hours talking about one of my favorite topics fermentation
this is
hoot to herbs grow and tell episode 11
um, we are
recorded
And simulcast on youtube every week here on thursday nights at 9 p.m. Eastern 6 p.m. Pacific time
Uh next week we're going to be talking about kelp kelp is going to be next week's topic
I think we mentioned that a couple times but uh, that's going to be a very formal. I think a very formal presentation
Nick's got some
tremendous information on kelp
and so uh next week is going to be uh, definitely a really really great one to uh,
Tune into and make sure that you listen and have your notepads ready for it because it's going to be uh
We're definitely going deep deep deep deep deep down the rabbit hole on that one
um, so
Uh anything to wrap up with tonight nick?
No, I think that's good i'm glad we had a chance to um
Be a little bit more open tonight and i'm glad we uh had some people come up ask good questions
Obviously a very lively chat on youtube going as well
So I definitely appreciate people taking time out of their day to come listen to us and definitely looking forward to next week when we
Go through kelp and seaweed sea plant based, uh fertilizers. So yeah, thank you all for coming here tonight and we'll see you next time

Uh
the poinsettia is
synonymous with christmas
Uh, there we go. Jim fowlis poinsettia
Let me open this up in a new tab

um
Okay, here we go everyone can watch me go share a screen
Boom there we go
It's the little piece of artwork I whipped up earlier today. But anyway, that is uh tomorrow at
8 a.m pacific time
That would be 11 a.m for the east coast
And some time in between for the people who live in between the coasts
Ah, justin is putting it all together. That is exactly why we're going to talk about the history of the poinsettia
um
Anyway with that
Uh, yes, he is, uh, pretty awesome
So and then alice and justice is going to be on with them next week, uh to talk about their respective research
Which should be pretty cool. So anyway with that everyone have
A very good thursday night later
