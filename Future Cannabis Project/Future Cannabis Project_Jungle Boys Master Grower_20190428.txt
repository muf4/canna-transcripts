[00:00.000 --> 00:03.000]  Ryan Martinez, who was the head grower for Jungle Boys,
[00:03.000 --> 00:05.600]  he was my best friend since 16.
[00:05.600 --> 00:09.240]  I had to laugh because I hadn't this particular gentleman.
[00:09.240 --> 00:12.940]  It was funny, just the way the world works.
[00:12.940 --> 00:18.320]  My wife and I are up at a show in Northern California
[00:18.320 --> 00:19.480]  at the High Times event.
[00:19.480 --> 00:21.640]  We hit up the Jungle Boys tent.
[00:21.640 --> 00:26.880]  I don't give out A's very often when we're judging weed.
[00:27.040 --> 00:30.320]  So we walk in and I'm standing there at the counter.
[00:30.320 --> 00:33.080]  I'm like, honey, check it out.
[00:33.080 --> 00:34.600]  That is an A plus.
[00:34.600 --> 00:35.760]  And so is that.
[00:35.760 --> 00:36.960]  And so is that.
[00:36.960 --> 00:38.320]  She like looks at me in shock.
[00:38.320 --> 00:39.480]  She's like, what?
[00:42.640 --> 00:44.240]  I get the hype, man.
[00:44.240 --> 00:46.760]  Here, those three right there are A pluses.
[00:46.760 --> 00:48.760]  That stuff over there is kind of a B.
[00:48.760 --> 00:50.920]  But these three right here, those are A pluses.
[00:50.920 --> 00:54.600]  Those are solid, solid genetics right there.
[00:54.600 --> 00:57.680]  So like four months later, I'm in another conversation
[00:57.680 --> 00:59.480]  with a friend.
[00:59.480 --> 01:01.760]  And he's like, oh yeah, do you know who the head grower for
[01:01.760 --> 01:02.600]  Jungle Boys is?
[01:02.600 --> 01:04.880]  I'm like, I don't know.
[01:04.880 --> 01:05.520]  I have no idea.
[01:05.520 --> 01:06.960]  He's like, it's Ryan Martinez.
[01:06.960 --> 01:08.200]  I just started laughing.
[01:08.200 --> 01:12.480]  I'm like, had to be one of five people I know.
[01:12.480 --> 01:13.320]  Had to be.
[01:13.320 --> 01:14.360]  That I grew up with.
[01:14.360 --> 01:17.320]  He was a big grower right here in Malibu.
[01:17.320 --> 01:19.560]  And he helped me develop my program back
[01:19.560 --> 01:21.600]  when we were 18 years old.
[01:21.600 --> 01:27.280]  We worked together, you know, like screwing up plants.
[01:27.280 --> 01:29.480]  Feeding them to death.
[01:29.480 --> 01:30.600]  Live and learn, right?
[01:30.600 --> 01:32.680]  This iteration.
[01:32.680 --> 01:34.920]  It was so funny.
[01:34.920 --> 01:39.240]  I just died of tears when it just was like, oh my god, what
[01:39.240 --> 01:40.680]  a small world.
[01:40.680 --> 01:41.400]  Called him up.
[01:41.400 --> 01:43.360]  I'm like, hey dude.
[01:43.360 --> 01:47.640]  Like, Adam, what are you doing, man?
[01:47.640 --> 01:49.040]  You had lost touch with him?
[01:49.040 --> 01:49.920]  I had just, yeah.
[01:49.920 --> 01:52.320]  I had been in Montana growing for seven years.
[01:52.320 --> 01:56.080]  And he came up, actually, when I set up my program in
[01:56.080 --> 01:59.680]  Montana, because he was my best friend.
[01:59.680 --> 02:04.440]  But we just had gone our ways and doing our thing.
[02:04.440 --> 02:07.280]  And he got married and had a kid.
[02:07.280 --> 02:09.720]  And he was down here busy as hell.
[02:09.720 --> 02:13.000]  And I was up there just busy as hell.
[02:13.000 --> 02:14.280]  Just living your life, right?
[02:14.280 --> 02:19.760]  And we had just a few highs, but not any real
[02:19.760 --> 02:22.400]  communication.
[02:22.400 --> 02:24.960]  And I just died of tears.
[02:24.960 --> 02:28.440]  When I had to be one of five people.
[02:28.440 --> 02:32.280]  It was either Ryan Martinez, Marshall Davis, Kelly
[02:32.280 --> 02:37.040]  Bellissimo, who grew that.
[02:37.040 --> 02:38.360]  Are Jungle Boys out of LA?
[02:38.360 --> 02:40.800]  Yeah.
[02:40.800 --> 02:41.640]  They're huge.
[02:41.640 --> 02:44.320]  They're huge out of LA.
[02:44.320 --> 02:46.120]  They've wanted me to come on board with them.
[02:46.120 --> 02:49.760]  But their culture isn't exactly my culture.
[02:52.800 --> 02:54.760]  They have a certain swagger.
[02:57.480 --> 02:59.560]  I'm more of a low-key, quiet farmer.
[03:02.800 --> 03:04.360]  I don't play with anything white.
[03:07.840 --> 03:09.080]  I smoke weed.
[03:11.640 --> 03:13.000]  Yeah.
