[00:00.000 --> 00:02.000]  Oh, never mind. We're good.
[00:02.000 --> 00:04.000]  What you got, Layton?
[00:04.000 --> 00:06.000]  Layton, that's not a Halloween outfit.
[00:06.000 --> 00:08.000]  It's just a baseball.
[00:08.000 --> 00:11.000]  Why not? I could be like, what was that guy?
[00:11.000 --> 00:15.000]  You're Johnny Knox? If you got some sunglasses, you could be Johnny Knoxville.
[00:15.000 --> 00:18.000]  Alright, well we're live. Let me go get mine.
[00:18.000 --> 00:22.000]  Why don't we let this song play out and then we'll kick it off.
[00:24.000 --> 00:26.000]  Let's see if there's a comment.
[00:26.000 --> 00:30.170]  How's that?
[00:30.170 --> 00:32.170]  Nice, there you go.
[00:32.170 --> 00:34.170]  It's Johnny Knoxville in the house.
[00:34.170 --> 00:36.170]  Professor Blunt's back.
[00:36.170 --> 00:39.170]  I got my mutant hat on today.
[00:39.170 --> 00:41.170]  Happy Halloween to everybody.
[00:41.170 --> 00:43.170]  There we go, now I can fucking see.
[00:48.170 --> 00:50.170]  So we're just waiting on people.
[00:54.170 --> 00:57.170]  Layton, you've never smoked on here, I don't think.
[00:58.170 --> 01:01.170]  Uh, no, I don't think I ever have.
[01:07.170 --> 01:09.170]  Can you guys hear the music?
[01:09.170 --> 01:11.170]  Yeah.
[01:12.170 --> 01:15.170]  Nice one, man. You got the mask.
[01:19.170 --> 01:21.170]  This is pretty spontaneous.
[01:22.170 --> 01:26.170]  So I guess we'll have to cut this part out and post-production anyway.
[01:26.170 --> 01:28.170]  I figured we'll just leave you.
[01:28.170 --> 01:30.170]  Oh fuck, where are we?
[01:31.170 --> 01:33.170]  You didn't know that?
[01:33.170 --> 01:37.170]  Oh, well, what the fuck is not being in here?
[01:41.170 --> 01:43.170]  Peter, did you fucking copy or something?
[01:43.170 --> 01:46.170]  Peter spiked the egg on the wall.
[01:46.170 --> 01:49.170]  Uh, yeah, I played hockey.
[01:50.170 --> 01:51.170]  Why?
[01:51.170 --> 01:53.170]  You were a goalie?
[01:53.170 --> 01:54.170]  Yeah.
[01:54.170 --> 01:57.170]  I was a goalie for a while.
[01:57.170 --> 02:00.170]  Through high school and into college I was a center.
[02:01.170 --> 02:03.170]  I can clearly hear you.
[02:07.170 --> 02:09.170]  I was a censor.
[02:10.170 --> 02:11.170]  A center, okay.
[02:11.170 --> 02:12.170]  Yeah.
[02:13.170 --> 02:15.170]  I always played the substitute.
[02:15.170 --> 02:17.170]  I never was for first string.
[02:23.170 --> 02:26.170]  So is everybody else trick or treating this weekend?
[02:39.590 --> 02:41.590]  We all good and stoned and ready to go?
[02:42.590 --> 02:43.590]  All right.
[02:50.380 --> 02:52.380]  Say goodbye to Peter Tosh.
[02:52.380 --> 02:54.380]  And hello to the world.
[02:56.380 --> 02:57.380]  Yeah. Good morning, Living Soil nerds.
[02:57.380 --> 02:58.380]  Happy Thursday to you.
[02:58.380 --> 03:00.380]  Obviously, we're having some fun today.
[03:00.380 --> 03:03.380]  The best part about this was it was extremely spontaneous.
[03:03.380 --> 03:05.380]  I figured Mr.
[03:05.380 --> 03:08.380]  Professor Bluntstache, our guest today, would be wearing something.
[03:08.380 --> 03:09.380]  So I grabbed a hat.
[03:09.380 --> 03:12.380]  And when we went live before the show, we both had something on.
[03:12.380 --> 03:15.380]  So we all got something on celebrating Halloween.
[03:15.380 --> 03:17.380]  So I figured we'd do a little bit of a celebration.
[03:17.380 --> 03:19.380]  So I'm going to go ahead and put on my hat.
[03:19.380 --> 03:20.380]  I'm going to put something on.
[03:20.380 --> 03:23.380]  So we all got something on celebrating Halloween.
[03:23.380 --> 03:26.380]  I know for some of you, you can care less about that.
[03:26.380 --> 03:30.380]  But if you have children or kind of just enjoy the night, it is kind of fun.
[03:30.380 --> 03:34.380]  And so Happy Halloween to all the family members out there, especially this
[03:34.380 --> 03:35.380]  weekend.
[03:35.380 --> 03:38.380]  The main thing that we're going to talk today on the show is mutants and
[03:38.380 --> 03:41.380]  kind of starting to understand that there's some love, hate, with those,
[03:41.380 --> 03:45.380]  obviously, kind of the same thing I feel like with autoflowers or something
[03:45.380 --> 03:47.380]  that, you know, those were actually called mutants.
[03:47.380 --> 03:50.460]  like when we first were getting into things, people were calling them like Frankenstein
[03:50.460 --> 03:55.080]  seeds and stuff, and things have obviously progressed. I feel like the first mutant that
[03:55.080 --> 04:02.240]  I ever personally saw was Dr. Grinspoon. That was something that was crazy looking, and
[04:02.240 --> 04:06.640]  no one wanted to grow it because there were no yields or anything like that. I wanted
[04:06.640 --> 04:10.600]  to get deeper into the freak show. There's a lot of things that have been coming out.
[04:10.600 --> 04:17.240]  From my research before this, Professor Bluntstache, I did want to talk about a variety of ones.
[04:17.240 --> 04:22.420]  Going back into albino cannabis, the Friesian duck, that was something that I also felt
[04:22.420 --> 04:28.340]  like was up there with Dr. Grinspoon when Overgrow and things like that were first,
[04:28.340 --> 04:33.340]  where people are really starting to show unique stuff on the old school forums. I remember
[04:33.340 --> 04:38.500]  seeing that Friesian duck. The Australian bastard cannabis. Another thing that's popping
[04:38.500 --> 04:44.300]  up on Instagram a lot are the leaf buds, so fan leaves that are out. Then basically the
[04:44.400 --> 04:51.200]  stem. You'll start to see buds start to emerge. That was pretty unique. Then twin seedlings,
[04:51.200 --> 04:55.040]  something that I've personally seen it grow myself. I thought that was pretty unique as
[04:55.040 --> 05:00.320]  well. I wanted to get into just talking freaks and mutants and just having fun with you today,
[05:00.320 --> 05:04.320]  Professor Bluntstache. Shout out to Leighton Morrison, and shout out to Peter. Everybody
[05:04.320 --> 05:09.800]  just wants to have fun on this show today and talk mutants and just have fun with it
[05:09.800 --> 05:14.620]  and be in Halloween and try to understand where the value in some of these things might
[05:14.620 --> 05:28.240]  be. I know to give the background, I know you are big on education. You were educating
[05:28.240 --> 05:33.240]  at the Cleveland School of Cannabis. Let's talk about that, get into your background
[05:33.240 --> 05:38.040]  so that the viewers can understand where you're coming from and your thought process. I feel
[05:38.040 --> 05:42.360]  like this is going to be a fun one, man, to deep dive and just really have fun with it
[05:42.360 --> 05:48.600]  and show that cannabis can be as unique as individuals and just have fun with those plants.
[05:48.600 --> 05:53.040]  I've always seen that people that do choose to grow mutants and stuff like that, they're
[05:53.040 --> 05:59.240]  a little unique themselves. I hope you take that with a ... That's why you were my first
[05:59.240 --> 06:02.560]  person to think of for this kind of stuff, man, because you're so unique and you're always
[06:02.560 --> 06:07.320]  passionate about education. Obviously, everybody on this platform, that's all we really give
[06:07.320 --> 06:10.960]  a shit about is really just trying to get the free education out there to people. That's
[06:10.960 --> 06:15.280]  something that you've continued to do, man. That's why, again, Leighton and myself and
[06:15.280 --> 06:19.240]  Peter, we want to give people like you the platform. I feel like if we're going to talk
[06:19.240 --> 06:25.640]  mutants, let's talk with Professor Blountstache. Awesome. Thank you so much, guys. Again, I
[06:25.640 --> 06:32.960]  love the show. I'm such a fan. I'm excited to be here because cannabis has touched my
[06:32.960 --> 06:41.600]  life in so many ways. She's like the drive of my day. She is the embodiment of kindness.
[06:41.600 --> 06:46.440]  I wasn't always into cannabis. I was actually maybe more of a late bloomer compared to some
[06:46.440 --> 06:53.040]  people, but I started using cannabis when I was 18. At that point, I wanted to be a
[06:53.040 --> 06:59.260]  chemical engineer. Why did I want to be a chemical engineer? Because chemistry absolutely
[06:59.260 --> 07:04.460]  intrigues me. The way everything is made up of all these molecules, different redox
[07:04.460 --> 07:10.300]  states, the way they're molding and going to almost a balance. It's like chemicals want
[07:10.300 --> 07:17.100]  to come to a balance. Sorry. My background was actually in chemical engineering. I worked
[07:17.100 --> 07:23.340]  in research and development at LG Rolls-Royce doing hydrogen fuel cells, which was very
[07:23.340 --> 07:28.940]  interesting. I've worked at NSF International doing compostable products, certifications
[07:28.940 --> 07:36.580]  and research there in their sustainability lab. I started to cross over as I got more
[07:36.580 --> 07:41.540]  and more into gardening. I got a chance to actually work on a blueberry farm for a while.
[07:41.540 --> 07:45.180]  Again, a lot of these experiences we might be able to flesh out to have a lot of great
[07:45.180 --> 07:51.660]  examples. When I worked on this organic blueberry farm, I noticed cannabis, I want to grow cannabis.
[07:52.260 --> 07:57.500]  At this point, I'm from Ohio. Right now, I live in Michigan. Obviously, it's way better
[07:57.500 --> 08:04.780]  there. Everyone agrees. Ann Arbor area is amazing. As I moved up to the Ann Arbor area
[08:04.780 --> 08:11.220]  to work at NSF International a few years ago, I started to grow cannabis medically and legally,
[08:11.220 --> 08:16.420]  which was really nice. There, I got to flourish under the new LEDs and all these other things
[08:16.420 --> 08:24.220]  that weren't accessible in some areas. I decided that I wanted to take this further,
[08:24.220 --> 08:29.300]  though. I felt as though that people who are able to make their own medicine, grow their own food
[08:29.300 --> 08:35.380]  like I was able to, raise my own animals, do all these different things, it empowers you. It
[08:35.380 --> 08:43.500]  embodies you to be a better person. I wanted to move further into this. I saw cannabis, it's not
[08:43.540 --> 08:50.740]  a gateway drug, but it's a gateway plant. It's definitely a gateway plant into homesteading and
[08:50.740 --> 08:56.740]  organics and all these different things. I actually went on to work at the Cleveland
[08:56.740 --> 09:02.900]  School of Cannabis online. Sometimes, I'd work on the weekends in person, all sorts of experiences
[09:02.900 --> 09:07.580]  there. There, I was the lead horticulture instructor. I worked there for about two and a
[09:07.580 --> 09:13.700]  half years. I developed most of their curriculum pertaining to horticulture, the introduction to
[09:13.700 --> 09:21.140]  horticulture, cannabis cultivation, commercial cannabis operations. I'm sorry, commercial
[09:21.140 --> 09:28.020]  cultivation operations, as well as introduction to extracts and a few other hemp classes that I
[09:28.020 --> 09:35.100]  worked on. I've definitely dived deep into this and have found that there's so much knowledge
[09:35.420 --> 09:41.580]  here that being able to share it is what empowers us as growers. Again, I appreciate you guys.
[09:41.580 --> 09:47.860]  Wow. That was beautifully said, brother. Fucking beautifully said. The only thing you missed was
[09:47.860 --> 09:52.260]  the biological interaction of chemistry. That's when it's like, fuck.
[09:52.260 --> 09:56.020]  Then that's the confusing.
[09:56.020 --> 10:03.260]  Then you start stealing electrons and protons and shit's forming and rebonding. It gets fucking
[10:03.380 --> 10:10.780]  nuts. Hats off to you, brother. Hats off to you. I love the statement, gateway plant. I've never
[10:10.780 --> 10:16.380]  heard anybody say that. That's a beautiful way to explain this plant. She's magical, man. She's
[10:16.380 --> 10:17.260]  fucking a unicorn.
[10:17.260 --> 10:19.500]  She is.
[10:19.500 --> 10:26.260]  When we got together, I think it was in July in Oklahoma, you came and brought Freak Show and was
[10:26.700 --> 10:32.220]  gifting it to the people there that were interested in it. It was such a unique plant that that's
[10:32.380 --> 10:37.420]  another reason why you stuck out on this, man, is I feel like you're always giving. I wanted to talk
[10:37.420 --> 10:43.260]  about the Freaks. I wanted to save Freak Show for a little bit. Maybe you want to jump into Dr.
[10:43.260 --> 10:49.900]  Grinspoon and some of these other ones that I feel paved the way for mutants, but at the same time,
[10:49.900 --> 10:56.460]  nobody was growing them because maybe Peter could find what Dr. Grinspoon looks like when it's fully
[10:56.460 --> 11:03.740]  yielded out. It is comical, the amount of product that you get. Let's run down those.
[11:03.740 --> 11:08.060]  Layton, I don't know if you've ever had the chance to smoke that. It was a fantastic smoke when we
[11:08.060 --> 11:14.460]  were there in Oklahoma, but I can't imagine growing, processing it and then working with
[11:14.460 --> 11:15.580]  that amount of yield.
[11:15.580 --> 11:25.020]  Remember that lemon cheese tie that I had? I gave Peter a picture of it. It was just like
[11:25.580 --> 11:31.740]  the leaves were little tiny nuggets. There was no real plant or no real bud to it.
[11:32.460 --> 11:39.020]  That was probably the craziest plant I ever smoked. It was amazing. The power of it was nuts.
[11:40.540 --> 11:47.580]  I have not experienced these other ones, although I did receive, I was gifted some unique cultivars,
[11:47.580 --> 11:56.380]  which I've been enjoying lately from one of our other guests. I'm really interested in seeing more
[11:56.380 --> 12:04.220]  of these types of unique plants and their unique combination of compounds. They're different.
[12:04.220 --> 12:05.980]  They're not like your typical cannabis.
[12:08.460 --> 12:12.620]  When you were growing at the Cleveland School of Cannabis, were you growing any
[12:12.620 --> 12:16.620]  mutants or anything like that, or were you guys strictly focused on just getting production,
[12:16.620 --> 12:17.420]  dialing it in?
[12:21.420 --> 12:25.980]  First off, before we dive down there, I got a little freak show. I'm sorry, a little berry freak.
[12:25.980 --> 12:31.500]  Sorry, Dr. Freak. She is absolutely beautiful. This is the same cut that I was gifting.
[12:31.500 --> 12:38.860]  Thank you for thinking of me. Appreciate that. Part of the reason that I can only move so
[12:38.860 --> 12:44.060]  forward with the schools, because in Ohio, they're not allowed to grow. I was growing a lot of
[12:44.060 --> 12:49.980]  vegetables, other things there to give hands-on experience to the people that were going there
[12:49.980 --> 12:53.340]  and being able to do it. It was all set up and automated for the most part.
[12:55.340 --> 12:59.980]  Ohio, there's a lot of limitations. That's why I'm really lucky that I have that caregiver garden
[12:59.980 --> 13:07.020]  set up and my friends who help me. That is just the place that I can go and be able to experiment.
[13:07.580 --> 13:14.940]  What I found at the Cleveland School of Cannabis, we did a great job of doing a lot of introductory
[13:14.940 --> 13:23.100]  to intermediate sort of information. As me, I would never proclaim that I'm an expert,
[13:23.100 --> 13:27.660]  although I do feel as though I have a lot of knowledge on certain things and can expand upon
[13:27.660 --> 13:34.940]  them. At the end of the day, that's part of why I want to branch off and be able to do my own
[13:34.940 --> 13:42.220]  education, really dive deeper into these sort of things. Next, you wanted to talk a little bit about
[13:42.220 --> 13:47.580]  Grin Spoon. Is that what you're thinking? Yeah, man. Start with some of the classics,
[13:47.580 --> 13:53.020]  maybe talk about that Pharesian duck. Then, yeah, get into some of the newer, like the lady on your
[13:53.020 --> 13:58.220]  lap over there, and get into why a lot more people are getting into the freak show and some of the
[13:58.220 --> 14:05.900]  stuff that seems to be popping off. Well, for me, I also agree that the Grin Spoon was really the
[14:05.900 --> 14:10.780]  first thing to really catch my eye. Could you imagine sitting there and actually trimming each?
[14:11.580 --> 14:17.660]  You got one bract, two bracts. For me, that seems like some sort of genetic
[14:18.620 --> 14:23.660]  deletion or something that it wasn't able to keep stacking. You know what I mean? It only
[14:23.660 --> 14:28.700]  could make that. Then, maybe because it was focused on those, it was like the best bracts and
[14:28.700 --> 14:35.580]  inflorescence ever made. We've seen that. We've seen that they're able to come from that stock,
[14:35.580 --> 14:41.500]  and a lot of them have this sort of growth to them. Hats off to the breeders that were able to do this.
[14:41.500 --> 14:48.380]  I think that was Brothers Grimm, wasn't it? At least I saw they had done a pretty decent amount
[14:48.380 --> 14:56.220]  of it. Have I got to grow that? No, but I would love to. Of course, we had the freak show, which is
[14:56.220 --> 15:02.060]  related to the Berry Freak, which I have right here. Now, this comes from the same parents as the
[15:02.060 --> 15:08.060]  freak show. Now, this is a different line. Now, Dr. Freak had done this one, where Shapeshifter had done
[15:08.060 --> 15:15.980]  the first one, but Dr. Freak had found the exact same parents and did the cross, and then hunted
[15:15.980 --> 15:23.340]  over a hundred of them, and found a few of them had this unique leaf. Again, this sort of
[15:24.220 --> 15:30.460]  change in the way that this plant wants to produce every single leaf on it. There's no
[15:30.460 --> 15:37.740]  normal leaves on it at all. So, we know the freak show. I think that one's been bred pretty far to become
[15:38.460 --> 15:43.740]  honestly a decent producing strain. I mean, as a production strain, I heard someone talking
[15:43.740 --> 15:50.460]  about an F9, F11 they're working with. So, those things are beautiful. They really do tend to have
[15:50.460 --> 15:56.380]  very thickly dense leaves in the canopy, whereas the Berry Freak, I think, tends to be more of
[15:56.380 --> 16:02.940]  it's softer. It's not as dense, but it has different leaves. It's not just inbred to
[16:02.940 --> 16:08.140]  kind of one sort of leaf structure. So, you can get different pinnate styles here.
[16:08.220 --> 16:14.380]  So, where do you think some of the hype is coming from? People just enjoy that they just love
[16:14.380 --> 16:19.500]  growing plants. This is kind of the one that they just love to see veg out and flower out.
[16:20.460 --> 16:24.220]  Or like you had mentioned, the yield is there enough to where it is fun to grow. It's unique
[16:24.220 --> 16:28.940]  enough. So, a lot more people are starting to pick it up, at least on the home grower level.
[16:28.940 --> 16:32.860]  I don't really see anybody doing this. I don't really see anybody doing any mutants, to be honest,
[16:32.860 --> 16:36.700]  at the commercial level, which is understandable. So, this is why this show is pretty unique.
[16:36.780 --> 16:43.020]  I feel like this is for people that really are home farmers today and people that love
[16:43.020 --> 16:46.620]  experimenting with their grows and experimenting with genetics.
[16:48.300 --> 16:55.260]  I agree. I definitely have not seen this done too much, of course. I do think the fascination is
[16:55.260 --> 17:01.420]  that we could breed further and find more things. I think that is what drives me because it's like,
[17:01.740 --> 17:06.940]  okay, now if I can get this and get this to look like that, but then be different. I think that's
[17:06.940 --> 17:12.300]  why I really appreciate Dr. Freak just continually doing this work and releasing all the different
[17:12.300 --> 17:19.660]  versions and being very transparent about them. Now, in comparison to some of the other things,
[17:19.660 --> 17:24.940]  like the Australian Bapster Cannabis, if no one's heard about that, that is just an absolutely
[17:25.660 --> 17:31.180]  different type of mutation that came from just different things. Again, this was a wild,
[17:31.980 --> 17:38.540]  feral plant. Yeah. That's an OG again, if you will. I think that one was around the late 60s
[17:38.540 --> 17:43.900]  or early 70s, like the 80s, 90s kind of thing. Some of these things have been around. It's just,
[17:44.460 --> 17:49.900]  I guess there wasn't social media to promote them because they weren't yields and stuff that people
[17:50.060 --> 17:55.660]  wanted to risk a lot of basically gambling with your life for certain things. It needs to pay
[17:55.660 --> 18:00.460]  the bills. It needs to be stuff. Back in the, I imagine in the 80s and 90s, you had to really love
[18:00.460 --> 18:05.020]  the plant to be growing this kind of stuff and taking that kind of risk. Shout out to everybody
[18:05.020 --> 18:11.340]  that did grow that stuff. I thought Barney's Farm was one of the originals from Dr. Grinspoon.
[18:13.580 --> 18:18.300]  There's a lot of speculation. I also saw that it was with the Freak Show, the dark horse
[18:18.700 --> 18:28.540]  ... I'm sorry, not Jace, Dark Heart Nursery. Have you guys seen ... Have you seen that the Freak
[18:28.540 --> 18:36.700]  Show comes from other ones as well? Who, in your opinion, is the originator of the Freak Show?
[18:36.700 --> 18:42.940]  Because I feel like there's a lot of speculation out there. Okay. Mr. Toad, first shout out. Thank
[18:42.940 --> 18:48.140]  you for that information. Grinspoon had taken it. I wasn't sure. I know they had stabilized it as
[18:48.220 --> 18:56.300]  well. Good shout out there. Now, again, I'm trusting Dr. Freak here as he has this strain,
[18:56.300 --> 19:02.300]  was able to replicate it from Shapeshifter, who I believe has some sort of bond with him.
[19:02.940 --> 19:08.540]  They're good friends in some ways. That's why I trust that he knows where it came from. Now,
[19:08.540 --> 19:13.420]  when the Freak Show was released, if Shapeshifter was like Dr. Freak, he was just releasing him.
[19:14.140 --> 19:20.300]  Anyone could have snagged it up and said whatever. From my understanding, Shapeshifter
[19:20.300 --> 19:28.300]  seems to be one of the major candidates. He even comes down to the lineage. If you go on over to
[19:28.300 --> 19:35.020]  Canada Research, I think underscore 2.0. I'm sorry if I got that wrong, Dr. Freak. You can
[19:35.020 --> 19:43.820]  find the lineage down on his page. It's supposedly a holy banana crossed with the pineapple.
[19:45.180 --> 19:52.540]  The holy banana had the banana OG crossed with the big sir weed, if I'm not mistaken.
[19:54.220 --> 19:58.460]  That is supposed to be bringing in the mutations, maybe just because it was so
[19:59.660 --> 20:02.300]  bred to a certain point that it was inbred in those mountains.
[20:03.260 --> 20:09.820]  I'm not sure exactly how that worked. Then again, the other father was found separately and brought,
[20:09.820 --> 20:15.020]  and then these genetics were brought out again. That's why I feel like Dr. Freak. He's like,
[20:15.020 --> 20:21.020]  okay, don't believe me, but I made it again. That's why I believe him. I don't know. Proof
[20:21.020 --> 20:26.940]  is in the pudding sometimes. There's so much speculation out there. Go ahead, Lee.
[20:26.940 --> 20:28.940]  Let me ask you this. Have you grown that all the way out?
[20:29.420 --> 20:32.060]  Oh, yeah. Oh, what's up?
[20:34.860 --> 20:36.460]  How does it yield?
[20:37.500 --> 20:43.660]  Now, I'll be honest. I had a few different phenotypes. I had the F2V1 and F2V2.
[20:44.460 --> 20:49.500]  Now, I believe that some of these were supposed to be heterozygous. I can't remember if it's a V1
[20:49.500 --> 20:53.980]  or V2. One was supposed to be homozygous, the male in particular, when crossing with these.
[20:54.060 --> 21:02.220]  They all carried the trait for me. All of them showed it out of the seven or eight that I popped
[21:02.220 --> 21:07.020]  again. I was holding some of these very, like holding them almost like for the vault. Then I
[21:07.020 --> 21:11.660]  had some that were skunkberry, which I believe are just a slightly different variation on the
[21:11.660 --> 21:20.380]  same line. That one had a bigger yield, although its smell was not quite as florally and citrusy.
[21:21.340 --> 21:28.140]  It didn't have that pineapple zest as much, but it did seem to have that nice funk and a little
[21:28.140 --> 21:34.540]  bit better of a yield. Now, I think when we're talking about these, in particular, ABC, all
[21:34.540 --> 21:38.540]  these different things, why don't people grow them out? I think we should break that down.
[21:38.540 --> 21:41.740]  I think a lot of people don't grow them out, not just because of the yield, but because of the
[21:41.740 --> 21:46.540]  vegetative time. The vegetative time for these is definitely going to be longer.
[21:47.340 --> 21:52.540]  Now, is that because they have less photosynthetic energy? I have a couple
[21:52.540 --> 21:57.420]  thoughts about that. I think that a lot of the time, yes, they're just not yielding as much
[21:57.420 --> 22:05.020]  because they're not bred for that. They've just been bred to show these crazy genetic mutations.
[22:07.260 --> 22:12.700]  When we're normally interviewing other breeders and stuff like that, we talk about what about
[22:12.700 --> 22:18.620]  runs? What about mutants? Is there any validity into that? I would say nine out of 10 of them,
[22:18.620 --> 22:23.340]  whatever the percentage is, the majority of them say, yeah, get rid of them. You're really looking
[22:23.340 --> 22:27.020]  for the best and brightest, the Serena Williams, if you will, kind of thing. We're trying to get
[22:27.020 --> 22:31.900]  to Wimbledon, the main thing. We're trying to build these really strong, healthy girls,
[22:31.900 --> 22:35.900]  get them to flower, and then at the end of the day, continue to work those lines.
[22:36.940 --> 22:41.020]  It seems like you can make a name for yourself if you're a breeder out there. I feel like part of
[22:41.980 --> 22:47.420]  to this day and age is marketing. If you were able to find a way to get your genetics out there,
[22:47.420 --> 22:51.660]  maybe play around with these mutants a little bit, especially coming from an educational
[22:51.660 --> 22:55.900]  background. Do you feel like it's worth it to play around with this stuff if you have the time,
[22:55.900 --> 23:01.900]  you have the space? It is worth running through these different variations than I would imagine
[23:01.900 --> 23:08.460]  the majority of people out there are hunting. Yeah, I agree. Not only are they fascinating,
[23:08.460 --> 23:15.340]  but I do think that they do have some sort of genetic material that's useful. I think almost
[23:15.340 --> 23:23.100]  every line does. I think that these in particular, the Freesia line and all those, I think they have
[23:23.100 --> 23:28.940]  a high potential for a pretty good yield. But again, I found that their yield was still down
[23:28.940 --> 23:34.860]  about 30% just for me. Now, is that because I felt as though roughly they were about a quarter
[23:34.860 --> 23:39.260]  or a third smaller from their vegetative growth? Maybe they would have had a bigger yield
[23:39.260 --> 23:46.620]  if they weren't timed at the same time as the other cultivars. I just hope a lot of people
[23:46.620 --> 23:49.980]  understand that I do think that these are going to be fun to breed with because they're also going
[23:49.980 --> 23:56.140]  to help us understand how genetics work and how to bring this further out in cannabis and other
[23:56.140 --> 24:02.220]  plants. Cannabis is not the only plant to just decide to do pinnate leaves. Pinnate leaves have
[24:02.220 --> 24:09.420]  just been absolutely fascinated. People have been fascinated by them for millennia. Of course,
[24:09.420 --> 24:15.980]  they're only about one in 100,000, one in one million, perhaps, chance, and then maybe even
[24:15.980 --> 24:23.420]  lower to find these sort of things. I think that just finding the crisscross of these synergies,
[24:23.420 --> 24:28.620]  it has to be worth keeping around because the magic... First off, I just want to make a bad joke.
[24:29.580 --> 24:34.140]  Imagine guys were smoking on that crazy lemon stuff or whatever back in the day,
[24:34.140 --> 24:38.060]  and they're throwing all these seeds out in their ashtray, and they're like, no.
[24:38.700 --> 24:41.980]  I look at these old timers, and I'm like, how many seeds did you throw in the ashtray?
[24:43.260 --> 24:49.020]  I just feel like everything has a value, especially when it has this unique of a leaf,
[24:49.020 --> 24:57.180]  like in my opinion, and very good smoke. It's not super overpotent. I would say about 15 to 20
[24:57.180 --> 25:04.300]  for my specimens, but definitely great. You talked about longer vegetation.
[25:04.300 --> 25:09.660]  So what are you talking? How long is it going to stay in vegetation until it hits the season?
[25:13.020 --> 25:18.220]  What I felt is that when I had grown it exactly the same conditions as some other cultivars...
[25:18.220 --> 25:24.540]  Now again, it was some other things from Rising Moon, which was a Manistee OG. It was a few things.
[25:24.540 --> 25:30.380]  It was some Slurr canes, some other things. Now I grew a few of them from seed at the same exact
[25:30.380 --> 25:37.340]  time, and what I noticed is that the Berry Freak was very quick to pop. It was quick. It was good
[25:37.340 --> 25:45.020]  seeds. It was scarified well. But by the time we had reached about two sets and two nodes,
[25:45.020 --> 25:51.500]  it was behind a little bit where the other ones were at three, four. So that kind of compounding
[25:51.500 --> 25:55.820]  effect. I feel like maybe sometimes it's just having kind of a little bit harder time getting
[25:55.820 --> 26:05.100]  going, and my ideas on this are that some people would argue, okay, well, I think there's the same
[26:05.100 --> 26:11.900]  amount of surface area. I think we can mathematically calculate that, and I think with the
[26:11.900 --> 26:16.060]  amount of branching, though, you can see there is a significant amount of branching on this plant
[26:16.060 --> 26:21.980]  because it has a lot of airflow. It's not restricted, and the plant wants to branch more. It's
[26:21.980 --> 26:26.860]  like when you take out the fan leaves, and then you notice, oh, wow, I'm getting a
[26:26.860 --> 26:32.540]  lot more growth there because down low now it's able to get more light. So this inherently lets
[26:32.540 --> 26:38.140]  those nodes below branch out, which creates a very short node structure in general. So it's going to
[26:38.140 --> 26:43.580]  be shorter than everything else around I've found, which is also an interesting trait, and again, I
[26:43.580 --> 26:51.180]  think just from the light penetrating the canopy a little bit more. Now, would we say that maybe
[26:51.180 --> 26:56.380]  because there's more leaves that there's more or same amount of photosynthetic flux being pulled
[26:56.380 --> 27:02.940]  in here? Well, there could be, but my ideas are that even if there is the same amount of surface
[27:02.940 --> 27:09.740]  area that we can calculate on the top, we still have the variable of every single one of these
[27:09.740 --> 27:16.780]  leaves has an edge, and we know that on the edge there's no stomata. So there's a lot more edge
[27:17.580 --> 27:24.140]  compared to leaves that don't have the pinnae style. So I think that maybe even these per
[27:24.140 --> 27:30.140]  surface area may have slightly less stomata. So that's just some of my thoughts on that. I could
[27:30.140 --> 27:36.860]  be wrong completely, so, but that's kind of some thoughts. That's what this show is all about, my
[27:36.860 --> 27:44.380]  friend, is theory and talking about it, and that was a beautiful explanation. But again, so how long
[27:44.380 --> 27:53.420]  does this take to finish? Oh, gotcha, sorry. Get off track. It's all good, bro. It's all good. So, you know, as these things are
[27:53.420 --> 27:58.380]  taking longer to vegetate, but when you flip in the flower, they're going to go about the same amount
[27:58.380 --> 28:03.900]  of time. So that's some sort of, you know, it's about nine to ten weeks for my specimens.
[28:04.860 --> 28:11.980]  I did also see, you know, shout out to Lorax over in New York, you know, he's doing great work.
[28:11.980 --> 28:18.140]  He did a nice big run of some of the freak show, and I got to see a lot of different types of
[28:18.140 --> 28:23.900]  pinnae leaves on those, and different ones that some turned purple, some didn't, and I believe he said
[28:23.900 --> 28:29.260]  those even took a little longer in his post, so it was longer than the other full terms a little bit.
[28:30.460 --> 28:36.460]  So I do think that this is not something that you want to try to chop down early, definitely. I don't
[28:36.460 --> 28:42.860]  think it's something that's at risk of getting a lot of bud rot at all, in particular. I mean, the
[28:42.860 --> 28:48.620]  citrus and those sort of things, they can pull some bud rot, but this had such a nice open structure,
[28:48.620 --> 28:53.980]  I would assume you could go even, you could go a little bit longer. So I definitely feel like this
[28:53.980 --> 29:01.500]  was more of a sativa, quote, uplifting high, and slightly longer growth pattern as well. So you
[29:01.500 --> 29:07.100]  might see why some people might not want to grow them as well, because they take so long, right? I
[29:07.100 --> 29:11.340]  mean, but you want to make sure that these are going to finish, you'll be happy.
[29:12.700 --> 29:17.660]  There are certain states that are willing to pay premium for quality stuff. New York is obviously
[29:17.660 --> 29:23.900]  one of them, I feel like Miami, a few other like East Coast states, right? So is New York, if he's
[29:23.900 --> 29:27.980]  growing it out there in New York, is it because they're willing to pay a premium for him putting
[29:27.980 --> 29:31.980]  all that in there, not getting the big enough yield, or he's just doing this for the love of
[29:31.980 --> 29:40.300]  the plant? Right, that's a great question. Well, I can tell that definitely, you know, Laura, I think he
[29:40.300 --> 29:47.180]  is just slaying it for the plant. And I do think that he has that sort of, that thought as well,
[29:47.180 --> 29:52.700]  that entrepreneur thought, like, yes, having that is different, right? I mean, even if you were to
[29:52.700 --> 29:58.700]  cross these or make rosin with them, that I think that it gives it a certain amount of value because
[29:58.700 --> 30:07.100]  of the way they look. And I just, I think that with what becomes a special high as well with them. So
[30:07.740 --> 30:13.900]  I think that he had, he dipped into both. But I do think he mentioned, if I'm not mistaken,
[30:13.900 --> 30:19.820]  he was like, they weren't the biggest yield so as well. So again, maybe just because he was
[30:19.820 --> 30:24.940]  vegetating them at the same rate as some of the other ones where if you were to vegetate these 30%
[30:24.940 --> 30:34.380]  longer, I think their yield might be similar. Or lower spectrum. I like where his mind is on that.
[30:34.380 --> 30:40.460]  I feel like if you are in a certain state where you know that, like budget conscious people don't
[30:40.460 --> 30:46.780]  necessarily exist, like some of the well off individuals in certain states, they will pay
[30:46.780 --> 30:50.300]  a premium if you can just bring them something they've never seen before, or you can be consistent
[30:50.300 --> 30:55.100]  with stuff that they just can't get. So that's where I think we could kind of move into the next
[30:55.100 --> 30:59.580]  one is that Phoenician duck. I remember that was coming around in Atlanta. People were paying,
[30:59.580 --> 31:05.500]  obviously, a huge premium for that. And then gramming it out, half gramming it out. You know,
[31:05.500 --> 31:09.820]  there was, there's obviously ain't, eights. And then they even created, or at least around there,
[31:09.820 --> 31:14.620]  I'm sure other people did that. But then they created this thing called teens or 16th. And then
[31:14.620 --> 31:18.940]  you would charge a super premium for that. And then just kind of, you know, if you get a QP,
[31:20.140 --> 31:23.980]  really make some profit on that kind of stuff. And the Phoenician duck was one of those that I felt
[31:23.980 --> 31:28.620]  like that's the only way people sold it. Or they would say like, oh, you can only come once or
[31:28.620 --> 31:33.980]  twice a day kind of thing. It just really minimized it to where it would last. So let's kind of go
[31:33.980 --> 31:37.420]  through the Phoenician duck. Have you ever grown that one? I should ask before.
[31:38.380 --> 31:45.260]  I would love to. But I recently did get something that I think has similar
[31:46.140 --> 31:49.660]  sort of leaves, but it also might be some sort of nutrient deficiency kind of
[31:50.460 --> 31:55.420]  going with it. But it's kind of interesting. I've never grown that. But I have done extensive
[31:55.420 --> 32:00.380]  research on it. Supposedly, I mean, there was people who were finding this back in the 50s.
[32:01.180 --> 32:08.940]  So way back then, I've heard of 1950s Phoenician duck. Now, if you're looking for that sort of
[32:08.940 --> 32:14.780]  thing, I think that it's probably going to go somewhere like where the bird actually came from.
[32:14.780 --> 32:21.020]  I'm going to probably assume Europe for some reason. I just feel as though they tend to have
[32:21.020 --> 32:26.220]  a lot more of those. Now, the Phoenician duck is the Dutch passion, I think, is the one that
[32:26.220 --> 32:31.260]  created that. A lot of these are Amsterdam. It seemed like they were the only ones to experiment
[32:31.260 --> 32:40.220]  and maybe rightfully so doing that kind of stuff because they had the space and it wasn't. I mean,
[32:40.220 --> 32:46.940]  you had to have a cowboy cowgirl mentality to really do stuff in the 70s and 80s and stuff.
[32:48.460 --> 32:53.420]  So not out to all those people, but yeah. I'll let you go, bro.
[32:54.140 --> 32:58.620]  Oh, no, no. Big ups, man. All the people holding down the market for real. Appreciate that.
[32:59.740 --> 33:07.420]  And we do stand on the shoulders of giants, so shout outs to them. And another reason I feel as
[33:07.420 --> 33:13.900]  though that some of these Phoenician duck mutations were coming from there was they had
[33:13.900 --> 33:18.220]  more space, like you mentioned. And not only that, but they were a little bit more
[33:18.940 --> 33:24.300]  efficient about how many... They were a little... I'm sorry. They were a little bit more about
[33:24.300 --> 33:28.620]  efficiency in general. So I think they did a lot of plants when they did their pheno hunts and they
[33:28.620 --> 33:34.460]  did a lot of these small, tiny plants in these greenhouses and things. And people weren't able
[33:34.460 --> 33:38.940]  to do that in California. You couldn't just set up a greenhouse and run a bazillion of these tiny
[33:38.940 --> 33:42.460]  little plants and flower them all out and pheno hunt them because, again, you're more on the
[33:43.420 --> 33:51.580]  mountain growing like giants, you know, back in those days. So they were lucky and they were able
[33:51.580 --> 33:57.420]  to do some of this work. And I think that's why a lot of these mutations were kind of found there.
[33:57.420 --> 34:04.380]  Again, now, do I think that this is a mutation that's a little different? Definitely. I think
[34:04.380 --> 34:12.140]  that this is a mutation that may not affect yield as much. It may not affect vegetative growth.
[34:12.460 --> 34:21.820]  Quite as much because the leaves are extremely large and they tend to have less of the edge.
[34:22.300 --> 34:27.260]  Right. So I think maybe they might even have more photosynthetic flux if they can hold up the same
[34:27.260 --> 34:38.620]  amount of surface area. So in your opinion, why do you think it seemed like Amsterdam was so ahead
[34:39.260 --> 34:44.460]  back in the day? Like, you know, if you were really getting into this at any time frame,
[34:44.460 --> 34:49.340]  especially like early 90s, late, even late 90s, most of the time you had to order your genetics
[34:49.340 --> 34:54.620]  from overseas. They would give you like a T-shirt or something like that. And as you started to grow
[34:54.620 --> 34:59.580]  these things out and improve your kind of like genetics IQ, you started to see that the T-shirt
[34:59.580 --> 35:04.300]  was probably more valuable than the genetics that they were shipping you. So then I think the,
[35:05.740 --> 35:10.780]  you know, the brighter minds started to understand that, OK, well, just because Amsterdam was known,
[35:10.780 --> 35:15.340]  at least at that time, kind of like it for the king of cannabis, that the genetics that they're
[35:15.340 --> 35:21.900]  shipping out are definitely not the A1 genetics that, you know, they made it seem like back in
[35:21.900 --> 35:24.860]  the day. And some of those that you had even mentioned, like Barney's Farm and stuff, it
[35:24.860 --> 35:29.340]  seemed like all of those have kind of fallen off to the wayside. And now the United States has just
[35:29.340 --> 35:35.340]  taken really cannabis internationally by storm. And the overall genetics, health of the genetics,
[35:35.340 --> 35:39.260]  for the most part, especially if you do your homework, there are some solid breeders out
[35:39.260 --> 35:44.460]  there giving what I feel like are really quality genetics. And some of them are charging a really
[35:44.460 --> 35:50.780]  fair price. So what do you think caused overseas to kind of fall off and allow the breeders in
[35:50.780 --> 35:55.420]  America to kind of step up and and take hold where it seems like more and more people from
[35:55.420 --> 36:03.180]  around the world are now buying genetics from the United States? Well, I think in general,
[36:03.180 --> 36:08.780]  it was definitely a multifaceted sort of fall from grace. Again, sorry to any of you guys listening,
[36:08.860 --> 36:14.460]  but I still think you guys have phenomenal genetics. But we had, I think we could start
[36:14.460 --> 36:22.540]  with some of the physical sides. First off, they have the very split sort of legislation there,
[36:22.540 --> 36:27.820]  where it's legal, but it's not legal. And then the exportation is kind of, they're all heavy
[36:27.820 --> 36:34.460]  on the exportation. So these businesses weren't able to grow as easily, in my opinion, where
[36:34.460 --> 36:38.140]  somehow it's like, you know, you live in America with a million laws, but they're sending seeds
[36:39.020 --> 36:43.340]  across the continents, right? Whereas places like they're much more stringent.
[36:44.700 --> 36:49.820]  So I think you kind of have that you have the legislational side, you have the sort of social
[36:49.820 --> 36:55.340]  side. They were always known for people coming there to visit. Now, when it got illegal in other
[36:55.340 --> 37:00.620]  places, people were going other places, you know, they were going California, Denver, instead of
[37:01.340 --> 37:05.180]  kind of having to go out of the way for some people in the world to get there.
[37:06.140 --> 37:11.020]  So I think you kind of got that as well. And then you have the actual breeders, right? Now,
[37:11.580 --> 37:15.740]  I'd say a lot of the breeders back in the day, they were all working together, the Cali, all the
[37:15.740 --> 37:19.820]  people in Amsterdam, they were all working together, I feel like that there was some sort of,
[37:20.700 --> 37:24.860]  you know, detaching from that. And then there was also a lot of drama within a lot of these
[37:25.500 --> 37:32.300]  bigger, giant, like Amsterdam Monopoly companies, or, you know, all those companies over there,
[37:32.540 --> 37:38.700]  so to speak, not just in Amsterdam. But then, you know, when those fell, it's just,
[37:38.700 --> 37:45.660]  it just wasn't as much to kind of come and gather from it. So I think that also their climate in
[37:45.660 --> 37:53.180]  some ways is may limit them. So, you know, in general, you have a climate where you can only
[37:53.180 --> 38:00.940]  grow so long, or you got California and grow longer, you can do more outside. So in different
[38:00.940 --> 38:06.700]  varieties, you know, so I do think that Americans are also known for making a large variety,
[38:07.660 --> 38:13.180]  indoor and outdoor. So I yeah, I'm very grateful to all the breeders out there. There's a million
[38:13.180 --> 38:17.340]  out there. I mean, you just sit here and shout out for like six hours, all amazing people.
[38:17.340 --> 38:24.620]  Yeah, it's pretty unique how quickly things changed. Layton, for you, buddy, how was it,
[38:24.620 --> 38:28.780]  like, were genetics pretty easy to get from you when you were like in college or something like
[38:28.780 --> 38:33.180]  that? Just as you know, as your peer group? Or was that? It was a nightmare, to be honest.
[38:34.540 --> 38:41.660]  We basically relied on bags. Because, you know, the Amsterdam, you know, that was flagged,
[38:41.660 --> 38:47.180]  people knew, you know, that that you were getting packages from overseas. And that was not cool.
[38:47.980 --> 38:54.140]  You know, you got, you got popped, a lot of people got popped for doing that. And so unless you were
[38:54.220 --> 39:02.220]  in California, no, it was a nightmare, you pretty much relied on vaccine. And or if you had a friend
[39:02.220 --> 39:06.780]  out west, they can send you seeds. But if if stuff was coming in from overseas, it was, you know,
[39:07.660 --> 39:16.700]  talk about paranoid. Not for your pretty. But I think the professor here is spot on about,
[39:16.700 --> 39:24.060]  like, understanding how that shift occurred from from Amsterdam to, you know, once once,
[39:24.060 --> 39:31.900]  once the market opened up in the 90s. God rest Dennis Brown's soul. He really he really was the
[39:31.900 --> 39:41.900]  one that that allowed people to just go wild. Humble, I mean, they mowed down friggin, you know,
[39:41.900 --> 39:48.300]  forest and built these plateaus on the tops of mountains and went wild. And that I think was
[39:48.300 --> 39:53.900]  where, you know, the explosion really happened of genetics. And, you know, there was a lot of guys
[39:53.900 --> 39:59.980]  that were growing, you know, you know, older, older hippies that were growing, but they weren't
[39:59.980 --> 40:06.220]  really they weren't really driving the genetics as much as I think what happened in the late 90s.
[40:07.180 --> 40:15.020]  Push was on to see where you could take this. Not only push the THC, but, you know, push yields and
[40:15.020 --> 40:22.380]  everything else. So I think I think you're spot on the way that kind of happens. And yet, I agree
[40:22.380 --> 40:27.020]  with you to this day. I think that, you know, I don't know all the state, all the different
[40:27.020 --> 40:33.260]  countries where they are. But yeah, United States is kicking out some damn good. So it's an
[40:33.260 --> 40:40.060]  interesting time to be part of it. And hopefully the rest of this country will start to legalize
[40:40.060 --> 40:45.980]  and be able to travel back and forth without worrying about all of them in the prohibition
[40:45.980 --> 40:52.780]  state, which is just an accident. Anyway, yeah, I think that's what's happening. You spot on,
[40:52.780 --> 41:00.220]  bro. I think that's how it kind of succession happens. Then, you know, there's a catch 22
[41:00.220 --> 41:03.900]  double edged sword, however you kind of want to view it, where it seemed like other brands,
[41:04.460 --> 41:10.460]  greenhouse in Amsterdam kind of sticks out for me. I personally love their super lemon haze. And then
[41:10.460 --> 41:15.820]  I saw them build like I think at that time I was like a quarter million dollar tank truck. And
[41:15.820 --> 41:20.540]  supposedly they were going around getting all of these land races and stuff. And so when I first
[41:20.540 --> 41:24.700]  saw that, I was like, wow, cool. You know, they're going out there doing the work. But then behind
[41:24.700 --> 41:29.020]  the scenes, I guess they weren't really paying for these genetics and like hustling people that
[41:29.020 --> 41:35.020]  didn't speak English. And it just, you know, maybe one day we could have our John or something like
[41:35.020 --> 41:38.940]  that on to discuss things. But that is the rumor is that they were going around getting a bunch of
[41:38.940 --> 41:44.460]  genetics, working with all this kind of stuff and then putting it out. And then I personally haven't
[41:44.460 --> 41:49.660]  seen them do anything with that. I was wondering if you had any insight on that or how you
[41:49.660 --> 41:56.860]  personally feel about maybe not a mega corporation, but a well-funded corporation going around and
[41:56.940 --> 42:02.380]  kind of looting, if you will, if the rumors are correct, the land race genetics from all over the
[42:02.380 --> 42:06.220]  world and then taking them for whatever reason. And it doesn't seem like they've done anything with them.
[42:09.340 --> 42:17.260]  I think you're pretty spot on with that, too, man. Sorry. I think in some ways the rumors,
[42:17.900 --> 42:23.660]  they could be twisted. They could be right. Rest in peace, Franco. I know again, the super lemon
[42:23.660 --> 42:27.980]  haze and all that and everything that he worked for. And I feel like they kind of stopped going
[42:27.980 --> 42:35.420]  out after that happened. I know that was painful for you guys. But what I'm trying to get at is,
[42:35.420 --> 42:39.660]  you know, as a white man, I don't want to act like I have white privilege or anything like that,
[42:41.180 --> 42:47.180]  which I do, of course. But when we're thinking about how can we actually give back to these
[42:47.180 --> 42:54.220]  indigenous cultures that have given us these genetics and how to give back to the planet,
[42:54.860 --> 43:01.180]  I think that is a question that people need to actually think about before they say someone did
[43:01.180 --> 43:06.780]  or didn't do it. Right. Because, like, I feel as though you're going to these places and you want
[43:06.780 --> 43:12.220]  to take their genetics and share them. In some way, that's like, OK, that's cool. You want to
[43:12.220 --> 43:16.940]  go there and share it. But in some ways, you have to find a way to give back to these people.
[43:17.740 --> 43:24.380]  And I, you know, I don't have the answer for that. I think digging wells and doing charity
[43:24.380 --> 43:29.020]  things like, you know, Boudai's doing, you know, hats off to him. I definitely am going to do one
[43:29.020 --> 43:34.620]  of those here in the near future. I haven't forgotten. And I think that things like that,
[43:34.620 --> 43:41.340]  we're able to give back to these sort of places. Now, now when you look at this situation a little
[43:41.340 --> 43:44.620]  bit and you look at what they're selling. All right. It's like I know I got a little emotional
[43:45.580 --> 43:51.740]  because I know that the emotions are on a high when you talk about that. But I do think that
[43:51.740 --> 43:57.500]  they probably did hustle some people. And I don't know how you could unless they were showing it
[43:57.500 --> 44:01.500]  more openly. I don't know how you could get back to them. You'd have to continue to get back to
[44:01.500 --> 44:07.820]  them. So but then, OK, let's go to the sales side. So I go to try to buy some super lemon
[44:07.900 --> 44:13.820]  haze. OK, I love super lemon. You can't find non feminized super lemon haze.
[44:15.420 --> 44:21.980]  You just they don't make them. So so then I look at this and I'm like, OK, you guys are just selling
[44:21.980 --> 44:29.340]  femme. But then you were going around trying to get all these genetics to share.
[44:29.820 --> 44:32.620]  But you found out all your seeds.
[44:34.140 --> 44:35.180]  My being a dick.
[44:37.420 --> 44:38.620]  No, you're spot on.
[44:38.620 --> 44:44.700]  No, we're just speaking. You know, like that was the big thing is I felt like they kind of fooled
[44:44.700 --> 44:49.180]  the world there for a while. Nobody talks about it. So I figured, hey, on a mutant show, let's
[44:49.180 --> 44:54.220]  stir the pot a little bit because I do feel like genetics are extremely important. And the last
[44:54.220 --> 44:57.980]  pure stuff is obviously land races. So if companies are going out there doing that,
[44:58.060 --> 45:03.740]  I haven't heard of a U.S. company doing that. But at the same time, you know, I'm sure they have
[45:03.740 --> 45:08.940]  some kind of recourse on why they did that. You know, obviously, they put a lot of money into
[45:08.940 --> 45:14.460]  being able to go into these foreign lands. And obviously, they built like it's literally like
[45:14.460 --> 45:19.260]  a tank truck because supposedly they would get shot at and all these kind of things.
[45:20.700 --> 45:25.500]  Probably rightfully so. So where do you think the pure genetics
[45:25.580 --> 45:29.260]  or some of the pure genetics and then things have kind of like watered down, obviously,
[45:29.260 --> 45:33.100]  over the years, but where do you think everybody was getting that in the United States? Do you
[45:33.100 --> 45:38.780]  think that was stuff that people really were kind of smuggling back from Vietnam? And those
[45:38.780 --> 45:43.100]  individuals knew the value in those genetics. So they were bringing that back stuff in that way.
[45:43.100 --> 45:48.380]  Or, you know, there's even been it's been proven that a lot of stuff was coming back in coffins,
[45:48.380 --> 45:52.860]  unfortunately, and a lot of kind of bullshit like that. But do you think that's where a lot
[45:52.940 --> 45:58.140]  of those genetics from America was coming from? Because it doesn't seem like besides some of the
[45:58.140 --> 46:02.380]  70s crew that are pretty famous, there were a lot of people taking the risk and getting genetics
[46:02.380 --> 46:10.460]  back to the United States. I'd say, you know, there's there's definite truth to that. And I
[46:10.460 --> 46:16.700]  have had firsthand experience from a vet tell me about those things. So they're not just bullshit.
[46:16.700 --> 46:23.660]  They definitely were doing sort of things. Now, the people that understood these genetics and
[46:23.660 --> 46:30.140]  understood what they were going to be building and collecting, they were probably collecting
[46:30.140 --> 46:35.100]  in the early 60s. I don't know how many more people were really collecting in America before
[46:35.100 --> 46:41.340]  that. I think a lot of them maybe a past again, bless them. So I think that there are far and few
[46:41.340 --> 46:46.780]  I think that there are far and few between sources that were actually coming into this country. And
[46:46.780 --> 46:52.780]  and I think a lot of the people who had all those genetics, again, I think they held on to them
[46:52.780 --> 46:56.940]  tightly as well, which was, you know, double edged sword in some ways, they were holding on to them,
[46:57.580 --> 47:01.740]  but not sharing them as much as they could. And then other ways, you know, they were holding
[47:01.740 --> 47:08.060]  on to them. So again, they could really give those genetics to the places I needed to go. So
[47:08.380 --> 47:14.460]  I do I do know, you know, skunk man, Sam, of course, you know, really old school guy has a lot
[47:15.020 --> 47:21.580]  of influence, you know, we get down to the RKS debate, you know, I mean, even people are debating
[47:21.580 --> 47:26.460]  about something back to that point. So it's like, I think everything beyond that's almost like hearsay
[47:27.980 --> 47:35.420]  at some points. But I don't think that there was a whole lot of people committing to
[47:36.140 --> 47:44.380]  committing to doing this sort of stuff in the earlier stages. So I feel as though we have a
[47:44.380 --> 47:48.860]  lot to learn. And hopefully, these older guys can really release all their genetics and do the best
[47:48.860 --> 47:55.580]  they can, because we don't want to lose it. Tell you that. Yeah. And I remember, you know,
[47:55.580 --> 48:01.180]  when I was first introduced to land race genetics, it was a darker green, definitely wasn't covered
[48:01.180 --> 48:06.860]  in trichomes like you see today. And I felt like I even personally like kind of thumbed my nose up,
[48:06.860 --> 48:11.820]  like, I don't want to buy this. But then when you, you know, the guy lets you smoke it, there really
[48:11.820 --> 48:16.700]  is a just a different high to some of these land race genetics, man, where they might not be the
[48:16.700 --> 48:22.860]  prettiest girl out, you know, dancing around. But when you get to know her, that personality is
[48:22.860 --> 48:26.940]  alluring. And I think those some of those different cannabinoids and stuff might have been there,
[48:26.940 --> 48:32.540]  where some of these old heads just had stuff that really nobody has. And I would imagine some of
[48:32.540 --> 48:38.620]  that might be in safes people have forgotten about, you know, for decades. So hopefully, maybe
[48:38.620 --> 48:43.340]  we can figure out how to get some of that stuff out there. But when I see people popping seeds
[48:43.340 --> 48:49.260]  on on a regular basis and pheno hunting, it seems like most of them are working genetics that have
[48:49.260 --> 48:58.780]  been around maybe 10 years or less. Yeah, there's no real significant DNA or I'm sorry,
[48:58.780 --> 49:04.380]  genetic differences between a lot of them. I definitely agree. A lot of them grow the same
[49:04.380 --> 49:08.540]  look the same. But then when you get something that you think might be land race, you know, like
[49:08.540 --> 49:15.020]  for one example, I was able to get something from being a hoarder where he had like a Durban poison
[49:15.740 --> 49:25.020]  that was supposedly a land race, southern Durban poison. So this plant had the oddest growth and the
[49:25.020 --> 49:31.100]  oddest things that it would do. First off, it was extremely vigorous and lanky inside of
[49:31.740 --> 49:38.780]  vegetative growth. And it also would produce just massive amounts of shoot. So it was just
[49:38.780 --> 49:43.100]  such a productive plant and it grew and it would get taller than everything else in there
[49:43.180 --> 49:48.620]  to have about a two and a half to three stretch, even if you were to screen it or top it.
[49:50.700 --> 49:56.460]  But the most interesting thing was no matter what lights I grew it under 10 hours, 12 hours,
[49:57.340 --> 50:03.660]  eight hours, it didn't matter. It still would herm out a little bit. I think maybe it just wasn't
[50:03.660 --> 50:08.620]  getting the full sunlight and it just was like mad or something. But I've seen that a lot of these
[50:08.940 --> 50:15.660]  heirloom or very old genetics will act a little radically, definitely not giving you quite as much
[50:15.660 --> 50:21.980]  yield. And it also had a trait that I've never seen on, well I've seen maybe just one other time,
[50:21.980 --> 50:28.300]  but it would make just tiny little like rose colored bracts right at the top. Just a couple
[50:28.300 --> 50:33.900]  little rose colored bracts. It's almost like its merry stem was like a rose color. So it was a
[50:33.900 --> 50:41.820]  really interesting plant. How are you feeding it? Are you a bio or are you a salt?
[50:43.180 --> 50:49.340]  Yo man, I just grow with salts. Just kidding. No, I'm a living salt.
[50:49.340 --> 50:55.340]  We got no hay here bro. We got no hay here. I'm sorry guys. I'm sorry salt guys. No, I think
[50:55.340 --> 50:59.500]  that salts are great and they have their place. I think salts are essentially minerals that have
[50:59.500 --> 51:07.500]  been solubilized. So take that as it is. I think that for the most part, living soil is the most
[51:07.500 --> 51:15.820]  important way. And when I was an educator, I was a teacher, I still am always pushing living soil.
[51:17.020 --> 51:22.860]  I don't understand why people don't want to do it. Literally the buffer on it is ridiculous.
[51:22.860 --> 51:28.460]  For like home grower, caregiver grade, kind of where my expertise is. And again, I would love
[51:29.020 --> 51:35.580]  to step it up one day. But from there, you can be like, listen buddy, you can just put this
[51:35.580 --> 51:40.300]  plant in here. It's a good genetic. You put RO water on it. All right, you want to structure it
[51:40.300 --> 51:44.540]  a little. You want to add some sea salt. You could pee in the water. I don't care what you do. You're
[51:44.540 --> 51:50.220]  not really going to screw it up. We're like, first off, if someone's just trying to make medicine,
[51:50.220 --> 51:55.820]  you're not going to be able to figure out all this pH and this and that. So I just feel like from
[51:56.140 --> 52:02.220]  value point of view and efficiency point of view for new growers and intermediate growers,
[52:02.220 --> 52:09.820]  it's really important to go living soil. But yes, I do rock living soil. I've been rocking it for
[52:09.820 --> 52:17.180]  quite a few years, about six years, seven. I had recycled some soil many, many, many times,
[52:17.180 --> 52:20.860]  probably for about four or five years. And then we put that into some beds.
[52:20.940 --> 52:27.900]  So I even had, I also have a partnership with Tilth Soil. Shout out to them. They're over in
[52:27.900 --> 52:33.500]  Cleveland. And I could definitely talk about them for a while. They're freaking amazing. But
[52:35.020 --> 52:40.780]  basically with this plant, I was just feeding a compost tea. I did notice that it didn't like
[52:40.780 --> 52:47.020]  to be fed as heavily, actually through liquid. I actually preferred to be top dressed
[52:47.420 --> 52:52.620]  with just some dry amendments. For some reason, that plant didn't like the liquid feed and it
[52:52.620 --> 52:58.140]  would get a little bit of burn on the tip. But I feel as though that for compost teas,
[52:58.140 --> 53:02.620]  and when we're talking about AACTs in general, actively aerated compost teas,
[53:03.340 --> 53:10.620]  the diversity and the methods for making them are extremely, they're all over the place. So we can't
[53:10.940 --> 53:20.540]  just say one thing or another. In some ways, I think that compost teas that are just inoculants,
[53:20.540 --> 53:25.580]  just bringing in microbes are probably the best place to start. So you don't burn your plants,
[53:25.580 --> 53:29.260]  for sure, in my opinion, you get a better balance to the microbes.
[53:30.060 --> 53:36.860]  You know, and you bring up a very valid point, or maybe I should bang at home is that not all
[53:36.860 --> 53:43.740]  composts are created equally. So you have no idea, unless you use a microscope, whether there's
[53:43.740 --> 53:50.700]  even microbes in it, and or did you selectively pick each plant that you use to make that compost?
[53:51.420 --> 53:58.220]  Because that's a whole nother world. And we're going to do a show on, I think it's FPC2,
[53:58.940 --> 54:01.980]  in Clubhouse tomorrow. Are you a member of Clubhouse?
[54:02.940 --> 54:04.620]  Yeah, I'm on Clubhouse sometimes.
[54:04.620 --> 54:10.540]  Good. So keep an eye open. I think we're going to do it tomorrow, either at three or Peter said
[54:10.540 --> 54:16.060]  something, maybe two. Well, keep your eyes open and please hop on and come join the conversation.
[54:16.060 --> 54:23.260]  So it's going to start with a gentleman who I have great respect for, who's made a compost,
[54:23.900 --> 54:29.500]  unlike anything I've ever seen. It's basically mayonnaise. All right, it's been broken down
[54:29.500 --> 54:35.580]  to the point where it's just grease. And I microscoped it, he does have some life in it.
[54:35.580 --> 54:39.580]  Not as much as I expected, but again, I understand because of the density of it.
[54:40.220 --> 54:45.500]  And then I'm working on the other end with gum, which is basically just roundup organic matter,
[54:45.500 --> 54:51.020]  like, you know, just truckloads and truckloads and truckloads of this shit. You have no idea
[54:51.660 --> 54:56.380]  what's in it. And it's changing every day, depending on who's cutting what down or
[54:56.380 --> 55:02.140]  harvesting what or anything else. So that's the other side of this, that if you're making your
[55:02.140 --> 55:06.540]  own compost, which I highly encourage you to do, start learning about the plants that you're
[55:06.540 --> 55:13.260]  putting in there. And that can really change the whole game on what happens to your plants.
[55:13.260 --> 55:18.220]  And the reason I asked you about what you're feeding is because I know a lot of guys that
[55:18.220 --> 55:23.340]  use salts have all kinds of problems with them because that nitrogen level gets out of control
[55:23.340 --> 55:27.740]  and the plant freaks out. And I think you're spot on about those land races,
[55:27.740 --> 55:32.460]  because if they don't get the same spectrum of sunlight, they're going to be pissed because
[55:32.460 --> 55:38.620]  they're not happy. They're not getting what they really want. And it's not probably providing them
[55:38.620 --> 55:43.740]  enough energy to create the eggs it needs to grow up a certain biology that they want.
[55:44.300 --> 55:48.940]  So it's, you know, and you're spot on to tell the audience that it's so much easier
[55:49.500 --> 55:55.980]  to grow in living soil than it is to be dealing with salts. And salts, they create lockout,
[55:55.980 --> 56:00.860]  they—mineral imbalances. You know, you're not going to get the expression that you could
[56:00.860 --> 56:06.540]  potentially get from the genetic. So yeah, thank you for bringing that up. I think that's a really
[56:06.540 --> 56:11.660]  important conversation that needs to happen. Brian, you want to add something?
[56:11.660 --> 56:16.220]  Brian Feroldi I was just going to kind of move to the other
[56:16.220 --> 56:20.140]  mutant that I was hoping we could all talk about, because for a while there, I felt like
[56:20.140 --> 56:23.180]  when people would show this mutation, they would say that it was light burn.
[56:23.820 --> 56:28.860]  This is just known as like albino cannabis. I felt like for a long time, people weren't—I
[56:30.220 --> 56:33.820]  think it was on Instagram. I don't remember seeing it on some of the older forums.
[56:34.380 --> 56:38.700]  So probably Instagram where people started to show this and everybody would chastise that
[56:38.700 --> 56:42.860]  person and say like, yo, you got a light burn. You don't know what you're talking about.
[56:42.860 --> 56:47.740]  But it does seem like albino cannabis exists. And I've personally never grown anything that
[56:47.740 --> 56:52.460]  looked like that. But obviously, Instagram is a great tool to see these kind of things in real
[56:52.460 --> 56:58.460]  time. And as far as I can tell, this does exist. I feel like other people have corroborated that.
[56:58.460 --> 57:01.020]  So I wanted to kind of get into albino cannabis.
[57:01.020 --> 57:05.820]  Dr. Justin Marchegiani Oh, man, albino cannabis.
[57:06.700 --> 57:12.620]  Now that's a different—completely different type in general because of the way I think
[57:12.620 --> 57:18.300]  that the genes are deleted and expressed in that one. Now again, I did want to mention that,
[57:19.020 --> 57:26.380]  you know, some of these are different genetics, right? So this one, for example, was bred from
[57:26.380 --> 57:33.340]  a spontaneous mutation, right? The random mutation of nature. This wasn't irradiated or anything,
[57:33.340 --> 57:38.860]  right? So Dr. Freed, did you radiate these with gamma radiation? Don't lie to me. I'm just kidding.
[57:38.860 --> 57:48.140]  But you come back to maybe ABC, you see ABC was completely also just natural. It just erupted out
[57:48.140 --> 57:54.380]  of nowhere because of probably the stresses of—of the environment, right? You're in a desert.
[57:54.380 --> 58:00.140]  So a plant with less photosynthetic flux is going to have less transpiration, which means it's going
[58:00.140 --> 58:05.500]  to have a better chance of surviving. So I can see why some of these colonies in, you know,
[58:05.500 --> 58:11.340]  Australia back in the day would make this. So again, it's because everyone—all the police
[58:11.340 --> 58:16.140]  would go around and take all those out, right? And they wouldn't notice those other ones,
[58:16.140 --> 58:21.260]  the bastard ones. So they would leave those. And again, they survived because they had
[58:21.980 --> 58:28.940]  some sort of advantage as a plant. So when we get to the white, I mean, we're getting into
[58:29.340 --> 58:37.020]  variegation first off, which is different than albino, right? But I think works genetically
[58:37.020 --> 58:44.620]  similarly because, you know, when you just are looking at a local leaf variegation, you know,
[58:44.620 --> 58:48.540]  you've—everyone has seen some of those leaves, and I've seen some of them before. I saw them on
[58:48.540 --> 58:55.420]  some super lemon haze. But I think that plant was a little more stressed. So, you know, I think I
[58:56.380 --> 59:02.300]  have seen variegation due to stress. I don't think it was exactly white variegation. But then you get
[59:02.300 --> 59:09.020]  that white variegation, and that's when it's actually just completely devoid of the chlorophyll,
[59:09.020 --> 59:12.220]  right? That's what you're talking about. Like it straight up looks like if you were to bring
[59:12.220 --> 59:19.020]  it too close to an LED light, pretty much. But they never really show them flowered out as much.
[59:19.020 --> 59:21.260]  And if they're flowered out, they're very small bracts.
[59:21.340 --> 59:27.020]  Yeah. I would say Washington's finest cannabis, that was the first time that I had ever seen what
[59:27.020 --> 59:31.660]  looked like real, not Photoshopped or just ridiculous kind of shit. Sometimes you saw
[59:31.660 --> 59:36.780]  before, you know, like five years ago, six years ago, I felt like when they were showing purple
[59:36.780 --> 59:41.580]  buds, it would be Photoshopped, and the colors just look weird. But yeah, shout out to them
[59:41.580 --> 59:46.940]  because I feel like as far as I know, there's only a few companies that have even shown albino
[59:47.180 --> 59:51.580]  cannabis, but it does seem like it exists. So have you had any experience with that,
[59:51.580 --> 59:55.420]  Leighton? Or you want to kind of explain why that's?
[59:55.420 --> 01:00:02.460]  Well, I think basically that was the plant's way of surviving. It's basically what
[01:00:02.460 --> 01:00:07.660]  what Bluntstache is saying. I mean, that's why you're going to get variation. And to,
[01:00:07.660 --> 01:00:14.780]  you know, push chlorophyll out of its leaves completely, that's pretty badass.
[01:00:15.740 --> 01:00:20.540]  That's pretty badass. And, you know, I have never seen one. I've never smoked any.
[01:00:21.340 --> 01:00:24.540]  But I would love to, you know, have people playing with stuff like that,
[01:00:24.540 --> 01:00:29.340]  because there's got to be something really special about that plant for it to do that.
[01:00:33.820 --> 01:00:35.500]  Well, that's why I wanted to bring this up.
[01:00:37.100 --> 01:00:38.620]  Okay, exactly. Exactly.
[01:00:39.180 --> 01:00:45.340]  So when those people are showing those variations and stuff like that, that's still trickery,
[01:00:45.340 --> 01:00:49.660]  foolery? Sounds like Mr. Toad saying it is.
[01:00:52.460 --> 01:00:55.180]  Yeah, we can talk about that. So shout out to you, Mr. Toad.
[01:00:56.460 --> 01:01:01.900]  I want to bring real information to people. So that was one that always seemed like an urban
[01:01:01.900 --> 01:01:06.140]  legend or, you know, had this lure to it that, yeah, there's white weed out there.
[01:01:06.940 --> 01:01:11.260]  Mm hmm. Exactly. Exactly. So Mr. Toad, you're pretty, you're pretty much,
[01:01:11.260 --> 01:01:13.660]  you're, you're exactly going down the road that I was going to say,
[01:01:14.220 --> 01:01:20.060]  some of these things are induced, right? So an induced mutation is different, right?
[01:01:22.220 --> 01:01:24.380]  Okay, that was interesting. Wow.
[01:01:25.500 --> 01:01:27.500]  He's a load of he's got tons of facts.
[01:01:28.700 --> 01:01:30.700]  He's got tons of respect from people, you know?
[01:01:30.700 --> 01:01:31.180]  Yeah.
[01:01:32.940 --> 01:01:35.580]  Yeah, Mr. Toad, you're always rocking it, man. Appreciate you.
[01:01:36.700 --> 01:01:39.420]  Yeah. Very cool.
[01:01:42.830 --> 01:01:43.150]  Dope.
[01:01:44.750 --> 01:01:49.870]  Yeah. And that was, you know, that was the big thing was the hemp plant or the cannabis plant
[01:01:49.870 --> 01:01:58.510]  was an amazing plant for making fiber. I mean, it was legendary. And unfortunately, you know,
[01:01:58.510 --> 01:02:06.190]  we've all had that conversation about DuPont, the abolishment of hemp in this country, which is a
[01:02:06.190 --> 01:02:13.950]  shame. Yeah, right. How would it synthesize if it doesn't have its little soul?
[01:02:15.550 --> 01:02:19.710]  Yeah, I agree. If it now, if we're going over,
[01:02:22.590 --> 01:02:26.830]  it's like, if you think about it, and you're trying to think about, okay, is this really
[01:02:26.830 --> 01:02:32.510]  being induced genetically? Is it genetic damage being done to it? Is it again, the light being
[01:02:32.510 --> 01:02:38.830]  manipulated, which I think is spot on. That's how these people are doing this. Now, have we seen
[01:02:38.830 --> 01:02:45.710]  actual plants have variegations pushed into higher percentages inside of their populations?
[01:02:45.710 --> 01:02:51.470]  Yes, we have through certain genetic manipulations, again, through radiation,
[01:02:51.470 --> 01:02:55.710]  these sort of things, they have been able to make variegation and all sorts of mutations
[01:02:55.710 --> 01:03:00.270]  come out of nowhere. Now, do I think that people are doing that with the cannabis?
[01:03:00.270 --> 01:03:06.270]  No, I think that we can pretty much put that to rest that if it doesn't make logical sense,
[01:03:06.270 --> 01:03:12.030]  if the genome can't photosynthesize, then how can it produce anything unless
[01:03:13.870 --> 01:03:21.850]  you were to graft it? But then you bring up that what if it was grafted? Would it be able to
[01:03:21.850 --> 01:03:28.490]  pull the nutrients from that? That's the only time I think that, you know, I don't know,
[01:03:28.490 --> 01:03:34.250]  but then to obtain an albino that doesn't actually produce anything, I don't understand
[01:03:34.250 --> 01:03:40.170]  how it grows past the seedling and how you could graft it. So that's the other thing, right? Could
[01:03:40.170 --> 01:03:44.970]  it be tissue culture grafted? I don't know. I think there's more work to be done here.
[01:03:45.770 --> 01:03:51.690]  But physically, an albino cannabis seed can't grow because it can't photosynthesize. It can
[01:03:51.690 --> 01:03:56.250]  grow out of its seed, but it can't. That's my understanding. Again, I'm going to be corrected.
[01:03:56.330 --> 01:04:00.810]  Well, then no shout out to Washington's finest cannabis with their food.
[01:04:03.850 --> 01:04:07.770]  They have me fooled because I was like, well, maybe there are just a few people out there that
[01:04:07.770 --> 01:04:11.290]  have that shit. They never wanted to share it because I remember the first time people were
[01:04:11.290 --> 01:04:16.170]  talking even about the pink pistols and that kind of stuff. And I feel like green source gardens was
[01:04:16.170 --> 01:04:21.130]  the first one where I was like, all right, that shit exists. So, yeah.
[01:04:21.610 --> 01:04:31.290]  Dude, when I was a kid, I would get cannabis that had purple and pink fucking hairs. It was
[01:04:31.290 --> 01:04:37.050]  unbelievable. And it was coming from Cal. That's all I knew. It came in these seal and meal bags.
[01:04:38.570 --> 01:04:45.450]  It was gorgeous. And damn, did it kick your ass. So I've seen that and I have never seen it again.
[01:04:45.450 --> 01:04:52.810]  I mean, it was available in the probably end of the seventies, early eighties was when I saw it.
[01:04:52.810 --> 01:04:58.490]  And it was like probably two winters in a row we got it. And then after that, I never saw it again.
[01:04:58.490 --> 01:05:02.330]  But I don't know if the genetic got lost or the guy got busted or what, but
[01:05:03.050 --> 01:05:08.650]  there is some beautiful shit that's happening. And I wish it came back. Again,
[01:05:08.730 --> 01:05:11.450]  I saw it for two years running and then never saw it again.
[01:05:14.090 --> 01:05:19.450]  And yeah, green source gardens, Nick and his wife are doing amazing work up there. The pinkleberry.
[01:05:19.450 --> 01:05:22.570]  It doesn't even look real, man.
[01:05:22.570 --> 01:05:30.010]  I got to smoke some of that back a couple of years back, three, four years back.
[01:05:30.570 --> 01:05:35.130]  What a wonderful smoke. It's just not, you know, not racy, not couch lock, just,
[01:05:35.690 --> 01:05:42.010]  you know, a very uplifting, happy, full-bodied high. But yeah, I wish more people would
[01:05:42.810 --> 01:05:47.690]  start pushing down those kinds of genetic rabbit holes instead of just bulk, you know,
[01:05:48.410 --> 01:05:55.050]  something that's more, I don't know, middle of the road, not super fucking racy or super fucking,
[01:05:55.050 --> 01:05:58.410]  you know, couch lock. But, you know, anyway, that's my preference.
[01:05:58.730 --> 01:06:04.490]  So, yeah, Sarah had a question. That was a good note, by the way.
[01:06:05.610 --> 01:06:10.090]  Yeah, you can graft anything. You can graft different types of plants to different types
[01:06:10.090 --> 01:06:15.450]  of trees. It's crazy how you can do a graft. There's some really cool new tools out there
[01:06:15.450 --> 01:06:20.170]  nowadays too that actually shape the plant so that you just put them together, put a little
[01:06:20.170 --> 01:06:26.730]  piece of tape around them and bam, they fucking take off. So, yeah, I think I heard somebody
[01:06:26.730 --> 01:06:35.530]  grafted a canvas plant to a hops plant. Actually, I know the guy who did it. I haven't spoken to him
[01:06:35.530 --> 01:06:43.450]  in a while, but he told me of his work that he had done. And I never got a chance to find out
[01:06:43.450 --> 01:06:47.930]  what the eye was like, but he said, yeah, he did it just to see if he could do it and he did it.
[01:06:47.930 --> 01:06:55.690]  He worked. He's actually the invisible guard out here in, I think he's in Malibu. He was up here
[01:06:55.690 --> 01:07:05.930]  in Oxford. So any crazy thing can be done with plants. So a quick note, what Mr. Toad just said
[01:07:05.930 --> 01:07:14.970]  there, is that why we are not getting a lot of pink pistols indoors? Because there's just not
[01:07:14.970 --> 01:07:24.330]  enough energy to make it want to create anthinocyanins in those, right? It doesn't want to,
[01:07:24.330 --> 01:07:29.850]  it doesn't need to, just like sometimes if I've noticed that certain lights have more of a
[01:07:29.850 --> 01:07:34.410]  response than another, and that's something I'll probably mention later. But yeah, as it comes to
[01:07:34.410 --> 01:07:39.050]  pistols, I think, you know, maybe it needs to have a certain amount of light because I've seen people
[01:07:39.050 --> 01:07:45.050]  take these and grow them indoors and not get the pink pistols. It's probably lights, too.
[01:07:46.010 --> 01:07:51.530]  We're just learning. Doesn't green storage only grow outdoors? Yeah, exactly.
[01:07:51.850 --> 01:07:58.330]  There's a lot of new work coming out about these light spectrums and how to mimic the sun,
[01:07:58.330 --> 01:08:03.130]  you know, like having cool down sunsets and sunrises instead of just bam, kicking the lights
[01:08:03.130 --> 01:08:10.090]  on. And then there's also those other spectrums that are out there, you know, the far reds,
[01:08:10.090 --> 01:08:17.930]  the far blues. And then there was that gentleman that we brought on, fuck, what was his name? Wolf
[01:08:18.010 --> 01:08:28.010]  Siegel. And he talked about the solar flare, the sulfur bulb that was an exact mimic of the sun.
[01:08:28.010 --> 01:08:33.690]  And, but unfortunately they're so expensive to produce that they're not readily available. But
[01:08:33.690 --> 01:08:39.690]  he's had some incredible work with, you know, or had the opportunity to play with these things and
[01:08:39.690 --> 01:08:44.890]  they're amazing. So hopefully again, people start making some manufacturing using it so that we can
[01:08:44.970 --> 01:08:49.930]  purchase them a quarter because I think it's like five grand for a bulb. Maybe it's even 10
[01:08:49.930 --> 01:08:54.410]  grand for a bulb. Yeah. Some of those brands were even saying like, you couldn't purchase it. You
[01:08:54.410 --> 01:08:59.930]  could just lease it. And then they like the lease price was crazy. And then obviously you got to put
[01:08:59.930 --> 01:09:04.810]  that in your warehouse at 25 or whatever they, you know, they would say like their, their bulb
[01:09:04.810 --> 01:09:08.570]  would replace like three bulbs, but still in a commercial facility, you still going to need like
[01:09:08.570 --> 01:09:13.450]  2025 of those. And I can't imagine leasing a bulb that's like, you know, a hundred dollars.
[01:09:13.690 --> 01:09:20.170]  And I can't imagine leasing something that you're not going to own ever. Why you would. Yeah. I feel
[01:09:20.170 --> 01:09:24.730]  like some of the lighting companies are kind of out of touch, even though they're really marketing
[01:09:24.730 --> 01:09:30.410]  to the cannabis industry are kind of out of touch with the way that cannabis is, is done. And the
[01:09:30.410 --> 01:09:35.210]  way that a profitable cannabis is done on the commercial side of things is it's getting harder
[01:09:35.210 --> 01:09:40.090]  and harder to do that. So without Living Soil, without something like that, I don't know how
[01:09:40.090 --> 01:09:45.130]  other brands are going to survive. And I feel like maybe some of the suits, if you will, might
[01:09:45.130 --> 01:09:50.650]  not even recognize that yet. You know, when we go out to certain of these, like MJ BizCon and stuff,
[01:09:50.650 --> 01:09:54.570]  like some of them are, you know, it's good to network and that kind of stuff, but it is eye
[01:09:54.570 --> 01:09:59.050]  opening to see how much money some people have. And they really don't even understand how the
[01:09:59.050 --> 01:10:03.290]  cannabis plant has grown or how things actually operate. It's more just like, Hey, this sounds
[01:10:03.290 --> 01:10:09.210]  good. I'll invest in these people or, you know, they feel like synthetics are the way to go.
[01:10:10.090 --> 01:10:11.450]  Because they can dial in everything.
[01:10:12.090 --> 01:10:17.930]  Yeah. It's the arrogance of humanity, my friend, control and ego. And that's where money gets
[01:10:17.930 --> 01:10:22.810]  involved and they fuck shit up. I mean, how many, how many stories have you heard of companies like
[01:10:22.810 --> 01:10:29.050]  just losing millions of frigging pounds, like up in Canada and here in America too, that, you know,
[01:10:29.050 --> 01:10:34.650]  these guys come in and they take over. There's one right up here in Santa Barbara. I've been up to
[01:10:34.650 --> 01:10:41.690]  the facility. It's fucking, it's a joke. You guys, it's horrible. The plants are covered with
[01:10:41.690 --> 01:10:50.410]  fucking insects and you know, they got 20 people running around looking busy. He's going, he's
[01:10:50.410 --> 01:10:55.290]  going to go out of business. He really is. I mean, he's in his third year. He's yet to really pull
[01:10:55.290 --> 01:10:59.850]  in anything for smoking, but that's money and stupidity.
[01:11:00.170 --> 01:11:03.290]  I don't know how it is where you guys are living, but it seems like in Denver,
[01:11:03.290 --> 01:11:09.290]  there's a lot less people that just want to work in general, you know, like from blue collar work to
[01:11:09.290 --> 01:11:14.730]  upper collar, you know, white collar kind of stuff just to regular people. It seems like less and
[01:11:14.730 --> 01:11:18.250]  less people just want to work in general. So I don't know how they're going to have enough time
[01:11:18.250 --> 01:11:23.930]  to, to trim and all those things, especially at the level that they do. And you know,
[01:11:23.930 --> 01:11:26.810]  if you're machine trimming, what's going on?
[01:11:27.210 --> 01:11:27.930]  What's going on?
[01:11:29.370 --> 01:11:30.410]  Andre the Giant, man.
[01:11:31.530 --> 01:11:32.250]  What's up?
[01:11:32.250 --> 01:11:34.090]  That's Hulk Hogan versus Andre the Giant.
[01:11:35.370 --> 01:11:36.010]  Hulk Hogan.
[01:11:37.610 --> 01:11:40.810]  We're getting the, this is where the chat is right now.
[01:11:46.410 --> 01:11:49.210]  Wait, it may be a little, I'll come back to it when it's the moment.
[01:11:51.130 --> 01:11:52.010]  When he lifts him up.
[01:11:53.130 --> 01:11:56.570]  So what are we about to talk a little smack about some light companies real quick?
[01:11:57.690 --> 01:12:02.410]  I mean, this is a candid show. So yeah, if it's worth it, you know.
[01:12:03.050 --> 01:12:08.090]  I mean, I got, I got some experience with a few, but I definitely want to come back
[01:12:08.650 --> 01:12:14.330]  to something before we get away from it. And that's the grafted cannabis onto the hops.
[01:12:15.610 --> 01:12:15.930]  Oh.
[01:12:18.970 --> 01:12:19.690]  Oh, that hurt.
[01:12:21.050 --> 01:12:23.290]  Okay. And then someone said go for it. All right.
[01:12:24.090 --> 01:12:32.570]  I will reach out to him right now. I'll text him and see if I can't get him to hop on real quick.
[01:12:33.450 --> 01:12:38.090]  I will. I will. I will not. I will not forget. We'll definitely talk about some of that.
[01:12:38.730 --> 01:12:45.290]  But what I'm trying to get at is, you know, I think that was the hidden mutant that I wanted
[01:12:45.290 --> 01:12:46.170]  to talk about today.
[01:12:48.890 --> 01:12:50.330]  Which one do you want to talk about?
[01:12:50.330 --> 01:12:54.090]  The grafted cannabis onto the hops.
[01:12:55.770 --> 01:13:01.930]  I just texted him now. So hopefully he'll get back to me. But yeah, he did the work, man.
[01:13:02.490 --> 01:13:06.010]  And what was his thought process and goal with that?
[01:13:06.970 --> 01:13:10.170]  You know, Andy's a crazy fucking guy.
[01:13:10.810 --> 01:13:14.570]  All right. So just to have fun with it then, right? Like that's what I feel like I was
[01:13:14.570 --> 01:13:18.010]  getting at at the beginning of this show. There's certain people that seem to love
[01:13:18.010 --> 01:13:23.370]  these mutants and grow them out. And I love to see that. I just wish more people would
[01:13:23.370 --> 01:13:31.850]  kind of maybe see the value in them. I know if you're really growing for just money wise,
[01:13:31.850 --> 01:13:33.530]  then the mutant really doesn't make sense.
[01:13:34.570 --> 01:13:40.810]  Another thing about Andy is he's got some really, really old genetic slant races that
[01:13:40.810 --> 01:13:46.890]  he's been carrying with him for a long, long time. And I know, you know, that there's a
[01:13:46.890 --> 01:13:53.850]  lot of people that want them, but he's been holding them tight. So, you know, that's another
[01:13:53.850 --> 01:14:00.650]  source that in the right hands could be really valuable to do the work because they are,
[01:14:00.650 --> 01:14:04.890]  they're pure, they're land race. They have not been bred with anything else.
[01:14:04.890 --> 01:14:07.370]  So but anyway, hopefully he'll hit me back.
[01:14:08.330 --> 01:14:12.330]  Another thing that's really popular on Instagram right now is showing like the leaf buds. So
[01:14:12.330 --> 01:14:18.890]  fan leaves that have a little almost like this size nugget on that fan leaf. You guys want to
[01:14:18.890 --> 01:14:24.010]  kind of talk about that mutation and maybe even Mr. Toad could chime in on that.
[01:14:27.660 --> 01:14:33.180]  Mr. Toad was previously on wrestling. Now he's back on topic.
[01:14:40.650 --> 01:14:45.370]  Not kissing cousins. Loving that guy. I love him.
[01:14:45.530 --> 01:14:50.490]  So what do you guys think of like the leaf buds? Even Mr. Toad, what do you guys,
[01:14:50.490 --> 01:14:52.010]  what's going on there to cause that?
[01:14:52.890 --> 01:14:55.530]  Peter, can you pull one of them up? I've never seen it.
[01:14:56.090 --> 01:14:58.490]  Sorry, what I was reading the chat.
[01:14:58.490 --> 01:15:05.290]  It's a fan leaf and basically like right here, close to the stem, a bud will form and sometimes
[01:15:05.290 --> 01:15:08.570]  like a nice looking little nug will form on that fan leaf.
[01:15:09.050 --> 01:15:14.090]  If someone could send me the link to a specific IG post.
[01:15:16.090 --> 01:15:20.890]  I'm sure somebody could grab that. But yeah, it's kind of the newer thing to show off,
[01:15:20.890 --> 01:15:26.890]  talk about. I personally have only seen it once or twice. Same thing with twin seeds.
[01:15:26.890 --> 01:15:32.890]  You know, when you're when you're popping seeds, two roots come out. I've never seen that before,
[01:15:32.890 --> 01:15:37.130]  except once. So I wanted to talk about those two things. I think they're pretty interesting.
[01:15:37.210 --> 01:15:42.570]  And where to go from when you find something unique like that. I guess some of them, it seems
[01:15:42.570 --> 01:15:47.210]  like it's worth hunting. And then again, some of them, it's their runs no matter what's going on.
[01:15:47.210 --> 01:15:52.170]  There we go. So what do you think is happening there?
[01:15:52.170 --> 01:15:57.770]  Well, Mr. Toad talks about hormones and he's probably spot on. You know, I mean,
[01:15:57.770 --> 01:16:04.730]  we know how hormones affect you. I mean, that's one of the reasons why kelp is so wonderful as a
[01:16:05.530 --> 01:16:11.130]  product for growing anything. You know, these water soluble kelps are amazing. You get
[01:16:11.770 --> 01:16:17.930]  quick plant reaction from them. So it only makes sense that that's a hormonal issue
[01:16:19.850 --> 01:16:24.890]  that's causing that. I mean, that the plant's trying to the plant is trying to breed. It's
[01:16:24.890 --> 01:16:30.810]  concerned it's going to die. And so it's pushing flowers and and hopefully trying to attract some
[01:16:31.050 --> 01:16:35.610]  So that's why a lot of those you see seem kind of deficient or, you know.
[01:16:35.610 --> 01:16:41.690]  Well, when you get into deficiencies, that's kind of what happens. Shit freaks out and it's great.
[01:16:41.690 --> 01:16:46.250]  It's dying. So it's going to push whatever sex it can. I mean, that's exactly why
[01:16:46.250 --> 01:16:51.530]  certain genetics harm is because they're they're stressed out. I mean, I know people that have
[01:16:51.530 --> 01:16:57.130]  specifically used nitrogen to freak a plant out. So it pushes the plant out.
[01:16:57.690 --> 01:17:04.010]  Use nitrogen to freak a plant out. So it pushes seeds. So it hurts. So it only makes sense that
[01:17:04.010 --> 01:17:09.130]  that plant is got a hormonal issue and it's freaking out. It's thinking it's going to die.
[01:17:11.610 --> 01:17:18.170]  All right, Toad, who cares? Effect the plant tissues. There you go. There's your answer.
[01:17:21.050 --> 01:17:23.450]  Shit, man. Can you imagine if we had this shit 10 years ago?
[01:17:24.250 --> 01:17:29.130]  I think question is answered by like you or Mr. Toad or Professor Bluntstache.
[01:17:29.130 --> 01:17:35.690]  Hey, when I grew up, this was this was sci fi, man. We didn't have this shit.
[01:17:37.690 --> 01:17:40.010]  Hey, Professor, if you're trying to say something, I think you're muted, buddy.
[01:17:44.240 --> 01:17:46.400]  Still muted, but you got to unmute yourself.
[01:17:49.510 --> 01:17:55.270]  Sorry about that, guys. So, yeah, I was going to mention that I definitely agree with Mr. Toad
[01:17:55.270 --> 01:17:59.510]  because I've seen people try to take that trait and breed, but you can't because it's not
[01:18:00.070 --> 01:18:05.910]  a trait that you can breed for. It's some sort of stress. And I mean, I think as we're moving
[01:18:05.910 --> 01:18:10.710]  forward, we're getting higher intensity lights. We're loading our soils more. We're doing this.
[01:18:10.710 --> 01:18:15.030]  We're doing that. I think we're going to be pushing the limits of this plant and really
[01:18:15.030 --> 01:18:21.270]  seeing a lot more of the stresses and things that maybe were more common and definitely seen in
[01:18:21.270 --> 01:18:25.590]  other plants for sure. Again, epiphyllis growth, I believe, is definitely seen in other plants.
[01:18:25.590 --> 01:18:30.950]  I've seen it on certain strawberries and things. So, you know, I think that that definitely is not
[01:18:30.950 --> 01:18:35.670]  something that we can isolate, though, but it kind of be cool to see in person. I've never
[01:18:35.670 --> 01:18:42.390]  got to see it in person. I don't know if you've gotten to. Yeah, the only thing I got to see was
[01:18:42.390 --> 01:18:51.110]  that that cheese tie, cheese lemon cake tie. It was just amazing. And I texted that picture to
[01:18:51.110 --> 01:18:55.990]  Peter. Maybe you can pop it up again. It didn't look like cannabis. You know, and again, I think
[01:18:55.990 --> 01:19:00.950]  that, you know, I don't know. I still have the bottle. I probably should reach out to the grower
[01:19:00.950 --> 01:19:05.590]  and see if it's still available because it was just such a wonderful smoke. But it didn't look
[01:19:05.590 --> 01:19:13.750]  like cannabis. Not even close. Really cool plant. But yeah, and I obviously if they're selling it
[01:19:13.750 --> 01:19:19.670]  in a dispensary, they must be yielding enough to make it viable for them to grow it. But it
[01:19:19.670 --> 01:19:28.660]  was craziest looking fucking plant I've ever seen. Have you guys ever grown any where the
[01:19:29.460 --> 01:19:32.500]  the seed had like two tap roots to start to form?
[01:19:35.460 --> 01:19:41.700]  Only once. I only once. That's a super rare thing. That's why I was going to talk to you about it.
[01:19:42.340 --> 01:19:47.380]  Yeah, I literally I mean, I'm not going to say I popped as many seeds as, you know, someone like
[01:19:47.380 --> 01:19:53.220]  Mr. Toad or someone who's much older and wiser than me, but I felt like I got pretty lucky.
[01:19:55.220 --> 01:20:02.020]  Because when I saw those come up, right, it was two for me. And I mean, I was like, hold on,
[01:20:02.020 --> 01:20:07.060]  because one was slightly smaller than the other one, but they literally came up through the same
[01:20:07.060 --> 01:20:14.340]  exact hole. And I was so sure that I only put one in there. I am like, I'm not trying to waste. I'm
[01:20:14.340 --> 01:20:21.780]  very particular. Got it in the little. It was definitely two. And again, the one was slightly
[01:20:21.780 --> 01:20:29.780]  smaller. And they grew very, very, very similarly. Like they, they could have been twins, but I'm
[01:20:29.780 --> 01:20:34.980]  not exactly sure. Yeah, that's kind of what it feels like. But then it seems like one twin
[01:20:36.020 --> 01:20:40.100]  bullies the other one. And then it seems like one plant kind of took over where the other one kind
[01:20:40.180 --> 01:20:44.660]  of stated, stayed stunted. That was my experience with it.
[01:20:45.620 --> 01:20:50.820]  So there were, there was two plants, not only two roots, but two, two, two separate plants.
[01:20:52.820 --> 01:20:58.740]  Yep. Two separate, two separate plants and two separate roots. It's like when I,
[01:20:58.740 --> 01:21:05.620]  because I wanted to take them apart. Oh, awesome. That is, that's a good point. Because they were
[01:21:05.620 --> 01:21:10.100]  slightly, they were, one was slightly bigger, smaller. So it was hard for me to tell. But when
[01:21:10.100 --> 01:21:14.340]  I separated the soil and I actually looked and I took them apart to get them apart and make sure I
[01:21:14.340 --> 01:21:20.340]  wasn't just like tripping out. I, they had two separate roots, but there was only one casing,
[01:21:20.340 --> 01:21:28.740]  seed casing I could find. It's weird. It feels like a lottery or something where you're like,
[01:21:29.300 --> 01:21:35.860]  what the fuck? Yeah. Too bad those died, unfortunately. Yeah. That was going to say
[01:21:35.860 --> 01:21:42.100]  they didn't seem genetically strong or something like that. Like they did seem like half of the
[01:21:42.100 --> 01:21:47.620]  energy was gone and it was, you know, to, to the twin, if you will, kind of thing. So yeah, that's
[01:21:47.620 --> 01:21:51.860]  why I wanted to bring that up as well. Cause popping seeds is fun and stuff, but you do see
[01:21:51.860 --> 01:21:56.020]  every now and then you see kind of the way nature is, or maybe just some mistakes that are made just
[01:21:56.020 --> 01:22:02.180]  naturally. It's kind of cool out that you can kind of just see for yourself just how plants grow,
[01:22:02.180 --> 01:22:06.980]  especially using a living soil system. I feel like, you know, that is the main way to, especially if
[01:22:06.980 --> 01:22:11.700]  you're pheno hunting, to get those full genetic profiles, especially if you're a new farmer,
[01:22:11.700 --> 01:22:16.020]  I don't know how you would achieve those to be honest in your first maybe year or two, if you
[01:22:16.020 --> 01:22:21.380]  were going more of like the salt route, cause you really have to dial in your environment,
[01:22:21.380 --> 01:22:25.300]  the nutrients and all that stuff before you're going to really get those full genetic profiles.
[01:22:25.300 --> 01:22:30.020]  So if you're growing cannabis, Hey, hats off to you, you know, whichever way you're growing,
[01:22:30.020 --> 01:22:34.820]  I think anybody growing cannabis, that's great. But our show is really geared toward the newer
[01:22:34.820 --> 01:22:39.700]  farmer or the newer person that wants to get into living soil. And so for those people, I feel like
[01:22:39.700 --> 01:22:45.780]  living soil is the no brainer because you're going to be behind if you're trying to catch up on the
[01:22:45.780 --> 01:22:50.660]  synthetic side, where I feel like you're going to be ahead of the game. If you started today or
[01:22:50.660 --> 01:22:56.820]  started last year, whatever, start next year, even I still feel like at least nationally,
[01:22:56.820 --> 01:23:00.820]  internationally, you're going to be ahead still of a lot of people because a lot of people are
[01:23:00.820 --> 01:23:05.860]  seeing this. They're not necessarily using these practices. And that's something I feel like
[01:23:05.860 --> 01:23:10.580]  Leighton and I would like to see more of is not just people enjoying the show and that kind of
[01:23:10.580 --> 01:23:15.300]  stuff, but really using this stuff for yourself. And even if you're in an apartment, like having
[01:23:15.300 --> 01:23:19.780]  a little worm farm or just little things where you can improve your skillset is what we'd like
[01:23:19.780 --> 01:23:27.940]  to see more of. And teach others how to do it. That's the real message that needs to happen.
[01:23:29.140 --> 01:23:36.020]  Because once you've been successful on one or two flips, you're off to the races. Now go tell your
[01:23:36.020 --> 01:23:40.820]  friends, go teach other people how to do this because it's not complicated. It's really fucking
[01:23:40.820 --> 01:23:46.740]  simple. And once you get going, you're not throwing anything away. You're not buying anything. You
[01:23:46.740 --> 01:23:53.700]  might buy a little bit of some organic amendments, but it's short money. It's not bottled nutrients.
[01:23:56.500 --> 01:24:04.180]  What are your feelings on that, Professor? On what exactly? Bottled nutrients? I'm sorry.
[01:24:05.060 --> 01:24:13.060]  No, no. Teaching. You've done the work. You've taught people and how valuable that is. And it's
[01:24:13.060 --> 01:24:19.220]  really good feeling. It's a spirit building. Well, I mean, from a teaching point of view, yes.
[01:24:19.220 --> 01:24:26.020]  Extremely spiritually makes me feel like a complete person to be able to teach. And I do think that
[01:24:26.020 --> 01:24:32.100]  when you're trying to teach something that lines up with your ethics too, I think you were
[01:24:32.100 --> 01:24:37.220]  onto something there because it's like you're trying to dump all this money down the drain
[01:24:37.220 --> 01:24:43.780]  towards stuff that's not exactly good for the earth. A really good example of this is
[01:24:43.780 --> 01:24:50.740]  my one dude, back in the day he was growing and we were talking about switching over to
[01:24:50.740 --> 01:24:56.580]  living soil. And I finally convinced him. And he's like, OK. So we went on. He got a flip.
[01:24:56.580 --> 01:25:02.660]  He liked it. He got the nutrients. He told his dad, I don't care. Get rid of them or whatever.
[01:25:02.660 --> 01:25:07.620]  His dad goes out and pours it in the ditch. Right. It's just like some bottle nutrient.
[01:25:08.420 --> 01:25:15.140]  It was like half a bottle. Jungle juice. And this stuff. Right. Sorry,
[01:25:15.140 --> 01:25:20.020]  John. He's not trying to talk smack. But and he comes back and he tells us he's like,
[01:25:20.020 --> 01:25:30.420]  son, I've dumped motor oil there. Any freeze there. I've dumped sewage. I've dumped everything
[01:25:30.500 --> 01:25:35.300]  that you can out of a car. Transmission fluid, everything. I put it on fire over there with
[01:25:35.300 --> 01:25:40.580]  gasoline. He's like, I poured this nutrient there and it killed the tree in the ditch.
[01:25:45.540 --> 01:25:51.300]  He's like, dude, I've dumped 20 gallons of motor oil. I didn't kill this thing in the ditch. I'm
[01:25:51.300 --> 01:25:56.100]  like, what are you doing? But then he's just like, we pour a couple gallons of this and I killed the
[01:25:56.100 --> 01:26:05.460]  tree. So like, you know, you got to think about it. Trying to teach someone to grow is like trying
[01:26:05.460 --> 01:26:10.180]  to teach them to grow themselves and their own health as well. So it's like a lot of how someone
[01:26:10.740 --> 01:26:16.340]  interacts with the world, you know, is reflected on themselves. So I try to live a really healthy,
[01:26:16.340 --> 01:26:21.060]  organic, healthy lifestyle. And the only thing that fits with that is living soil.
[01:26:21.060 --> 01:26:25.300]  And it's the only thing that makes me feel OK about teaching. You know, I've had offers to go
[01:26:25.300 --> 01:26:30.740]  grow giant amounts in Oklahoma and blah, blah, blah with salts. But that's just not an interest to me.
[01:26:32.020 --> 01:26:36.260]  Yeah, I will say that you are pretty jacked. The shirt you're wearing today is going to hide it.
[01:26:36.260 --> 01:26:40.980]  But yeah, shout out to your overall health is something that I'm starting myself trying to get
[01:26:40.980 --> 01:26:47.700]  more back into. Unfortunately, maybe it's later in life. But when I was younger, I was and I felt
[01:26:47.700 --> 01:26:51.540]  like I've said this on a couple of shows. I feel like as you get older, you forget how good you
[01:26:51.540 --> 01:26:56.500]  could feel until you get back to healthy nutrition, working out at least a little bit, you know,
[01:26:56.500 --> 01:27:02.420]  taking a walk, going outside, all those little things I think we just used to do. I will myself
[01:27:02.420 --> 01:27:06.820]  see like I'll get caught up in working on our website or something like that and not even go
[01:27:06.820 --> 01:27:11.460]  outside that day. So I've been consciously probably for the last like five, six months,
[01:27:11.460 --> 01:27:15.700]  partly inspired by you, brother, is like you're really big on health, man. And I see your
[01:27:16.500 --> 01:27:20.980]  your body's basically, in my opinion, the best resume for yourself, where your mindset is,
[01:27:20.980 --> 01:27:26.260]  your discipline, right? So if you're if you're not in good health, that's self-discipline. If
[01:27:26.260 --> 01:27:32.100]  you are in good health and jacked, which Professor Bluntstache is, it kind of shows you, you know,
[01:27:32.100 --> 01:27:37.300]  the your mindset of what is important and where you're at. So just wanted to give another shout
[01:27:37.300 --> 01:27:43.220]  out to just health overall. I don't think a lot of farmers in general pay attention that as much
[01:27:44.100 --> 01:27:49.060]  as I wish, because feeling great and then getting to go grow weed. I mean, that has got to be the
[01:27:49.060 --> 01:27:54.340]  lifestyle. You know, I've seen that from, you know, guys that are extremely healthy and are
[01:27:54.340 --> 01:28:00.180]  growing on a commercial level. They almost have like a kiddish little grin on their face when you
[01:28:00.180 --> 01:28:03.620]  talk to them about it because they're feeling good. They you know, they lift weights.
[01:28:04.580 --> 01:28:11.060]  Oh, actually, it looks like Josh Stiesland.
[01:28:13.540 --> 01:28:15.940]  Dude, that looks like a graph to me and Josh Stiesland.
[01:28:17.940 --> 01:28:19.540]  Shout out to you, Josh. Yeah.
[01:28:20.740 --> 01:28:25.060]  So just a lot of people, I feel like if they were to lift weights a little bit, man, you're you were
[01:28:25.060 --> 01:28:28.900]  big on just kind of showing people about the kettlebell and all that kind of stuff. So, yeah,
[01:28:28.900 --> 01:28:32.900]  just wanted to quickly talk about that. And then another thing I saw you're involved with
[01:28:32.900 --> 01:28:38.820]  also with Chandler. So shout out to Chandler was the the compost, the cup, the kind of like the
[01:28:38.820 --> 01:28:43.860]  gathering of the soil nerds kind of thing. So I wanted to give a shout out to that because I think
[01:28:43.860 --> 01:28:49.940]  that is fantastic. The more events where people are putting them on. I personally know how stressful
[01:28:49.940 --> 01:28:53.540]  all that shit is. I know Leighton knows that. I'm sure, you know, Peter's going to know that when
[01:28:53.540 --> 01:28:59.940]  he gets his sounds like his Tonka toy in January, hopefully, where you can put on a lot of events
[01:28:59.940 --> 01:29:04.660]  and that kind of stuff. And behind the scenes, it is a nightmare, sometimes even a thankless job.
[01:29:05.300 --> 01:29:10.100]  So what kind of stuff were you guys going over? I saw that there were a lot of bright minds
[01:29:10.740 --> 01:29:21.060]  gathered that day. That was an amazing time. We had, you know, JetHouse and Organic Alexa set that
[01:29:21.060 --> 01:29:27.060]  up, you know, big ups to them. And what we came together to do was for everyone to bring the
[01:29:27.460 --> 01:29:34.340]  sort of compost, their techniques, their ideas, their flowers, and get on some panels and have an
[01:29:34.340 --> 01:29:40.420]  open conversation, more of a symposium and taking questions from a lot of people who had come there
[01:29:40.420 --> 01:29:45.860]  to learn things, you know, similar to the if this class, if this was like in person, that would have
[01:29:45.860 --> 01:29:52.500]  been almost exactly like what it was. So we had people who were able to contribute and we got to
[01:29:53.380 --> 01:29:59.140]  sit on the panel for almost everything. We had a natural farming panel, we had a composting panel,
[01:29:59.140 --> 01:30:06.500]  we had some other panels as well that had to do with, you know, health, yoga. We had some mushroom
[01:30:06.500 --> 01:30:12.900]  panels, which were awesome, a microscope demonstration. And I'd say one of the best
[01:30:12.900 --> 01:30:19.220]  things that we got to do was go on a night mushroom hunt for some UV fluorescent mushrooms.
[01:30:20.180 --> 01:30:24.420]  So UV fluorescent mushrooms, if you hit them with the UV light, they will again,
[01:30:24.420 --> 01:30:30.980]  fluorescent green. So we went out to the woods to try to find mycelium and try to find certain
[01:30:30.980 --> 01:30:36.740]  organisms. And we did, we found a few species of small plants, as well as about three or four
[01:30:36.740 --> 01:30:43.540]  different species of mushrooms. So, you know, just getting together after all of this crazy stuff
[01:30:44.420 --> 01:30:49.140]  with COVID and everything, I know it's definitely affected me and I'm sure everyone else.
[01:30:49.140 --> 01:30:53.940]  Being able to be there and talk about our advanced methods and talk about the things that we love.
[01:30:53.940 --> 01:30:59.780]  I mean, you could see all of us were just like brightening up and just coming back to our full
[01:30:59.780 --> 01:31:06.740]  selves and that light. So it was beautiful there. But for, you know, for the most part,
[01:31:06.740 --> 01:31:14.100]  we went over a lot of things about compost. Now, in my opinion, I really don't think that
[01:31:14.100 --> 01:31:20.100]  there's any other way to create a good soil without a good compost, right? Even a soilless media,
[01:31:20.100 --> 01:31:28.260]  it doesn't really matter. So you need this core to it all. And what we found is that people were
[01:31:28.260 --> 01:31:33.700]  making compost from so many different things. And sometimes they weren't even perfect carbon
[01:31:33.700 --> 01:31:38.260]  to nitrogen ratios. I could tell from what they were explaining, but the way that they would age
[01:31:38.260 --> 01:31:43.060]  them, leach them or do specific things or apply them in specific ways would make them work for
[01:31:43.060 --> 01:31:50.180]  their situation. So I think that going there and understanding that there's no such thing as it was
[01:31:50.180 --> 01:31:56.580]  one size fits all. And I think that, you know, deep diving into compost could be a definitely
[01:31:57.300 --> 01:32:08.420]  a good little tangent. I did work in compostable products at NSF International. So you guys all
[01:32:08.420 --> 01:32:15.940]  know the Keurig cups, the takeout stuff that you get that says compostable on it. I did a lot of
[01:32:15.940 --> 01:32:23.860]  that testing. So I would actually create my own compost from specific feeds. And then we would
[01:32:23.860 --> 01:32:28.100]  do testing on those to see if it would disintegrate. And we also did ecotoxicity
[01:32:28.100 --> 01:32:34.580]  testing to ASTM guidelines to be able to see if it did affect plant growth. So even if it did break
[01:32:34.580 --> 01:32:42.820]  down, did it affect plant growth or not? And I can tell you that from making all sorts of
[01:32:42.820 --> 01:32:49.620]  different compost from different feedstocks, you know, as long as you have your carbon and nitrogen
[01:32:49.620 --> 01:32:54.020]  and your moisture level right, you're pretty much going to be spot on at creating something
[01:32:54.020 --> 01:33:00.820]  that can make fertility. So don't be afraid to get out there and do it. But quick note, as far as
[01:33:02.020 --> 01:33:08.260]  those Keurig cups and some of that stuff, it's not really compostable. I'm sorry that I certified
[01:33:08.260 --> 01:33:16.980]  them. Good man. Good man. But I did, I definitely wanted to chime in with P to N ratios. I've been
[01:33:16.980 --> 01:33:21.620]  doing a lot of work with that over the last couple of years, and I found that it's not as
[01:33:21.620 --> 01:33:25.940]  important as people make it to be. And there's a gentleman out here, Dave Green that works for
[01:33:25.940 --> 01:33:30.420]  Agerman. He was the first guy I've ever met doing commercial compost that agreed with me.
[01:33:31.140 --> 01:33:39.860]  That it's really, we use it as a way to determine maturity, but I've had, I've had compost that
[01:33:39.860 --> 01:33:45.220]  were, you know, would be considered immature because there was so much carbon that worked
[01:33:45.220 --> 01:33:51.540]  great. So, you know, there's, there's more to unlock in this. And that's again, why I'm doing
[01:33:51.540 --> 01:33:58.100]  this conversation starting tomorrow to get this kind of conversations happening about, you know,
[01:33:58.100 --> 01:34:03.540]  composting it. What is it? And, you know, some of the, some of the other really cool work that's
[01:34:03.540 --> 01:34:10.500]  been going on behind the scenes is they took some of my product. They were doing a study on atrazine.
[01:34:10.500 --> 01:34:14.740]  So they wanted to break atrazine down in the soil. And it's a horrible pesticide that has a
[01:34:14.740 --> 01:34:22.900]  residual life that's ridiculously long, or half-life. And so they were using white rot fungi, so a sap
[01:34:22.900 --> 01:34:30.660]  rope, and they had success in breaking it down. But what the problem was, what's left behind was
[01:34:30.660 --> 01:34:35.860]  the secondary metabolites, which are just as toxic. So they were able to break the molecule,
[01:34:36.340 --> 01:34:42.180]  but what was left behind was problematic. So they actually introduced some of the products that I
[01:34:42.180 --> 01:34:49.380]  made to it and were able to wipe out to no trace of secondary metabolites. So it just shows you
[01:34:49.380 --> 01:34:55.060]  how critical the biological piece is. And I swear, you know, I've gone across the country numerous
[01:34:55.060 --> 01:34:59.380]  times, worked with a lot of people that, oh, I make the best compost. You know, you've got to
[01:34:59.380 --> 01:35:08.180]  see my compost. I microscope it. No. And that's the problem is that you really need to introduce
[01:35:08.180 --> 01:35:14.580]  either a biological inoculant or some kind of ferment to get that stuff going so that it does
[01:35:14.580 --> 01:35:21.380]  become a biological Eden bomb. So that when you do use it, you are going to get plant reaction
[01:35:21.380 --> 01:35:28.980]  right away. Yeah, there's some stuff that's going to increase nutritional value. So it's not like
[01:35:28.980 --> 01:35:33.540]  there's bad compost. It's just different. Like you said, there's different types and they can be
[01:35:33.540 --> 01:35:38.900]  used as different tools. Like when I heard that they were taking this gum out here and spreading
[01:35:38.900 --> 01:35:46.580]  it on fields to do anaerobic digestion to kill off the crown rot fungi. I'm like, what the fuck?
[01:35:47.220 --> 01:35:50.820]  What is this world coming to? But then I started thinking about it. I'm like, well, they got all
[01:35:50.820 --> 01:35:56.900]  this green waste. They can't pile it up because it'll it'll be combust. They got to use it somewhere.
[01:35:56.980 --> 01:36:02.580]  And they're actually by default adding carbon to the soil, which means that the microbes could
[01:36:02.580 --> 01:36:08.820]  actually start to colonize and start to break this down. So even even freshly ground organic
[01:36:08.820 --> 01:36:15.780]  matter, it still has a value and a purpose for for use for good use. But you just you don't want to
[01:36:15.780 --> 01:36:23.540]  put it on a plant. You'll kill it. And you said they're pretty much not even controlling those
[01:36:23.540 --> 01:36:31.060]  that C to N ratio or anything. And it's all it's pretty much all probably nitrogen at some
[01:36:31.060 --> 01:36:38.020]  points unless they're adding some sort of waste from carbon sources. I think I mean, and they're
[01:36:39.060 --> 01:36:44.740]  I'm doing the work now. And so I've been posting a little bit on IG about some of the things that
[01:36:44.740 --> 01:36:50.980]  I'm working on right now. I'm using minerals, so different types of stone dust to arrest the
[01:36:50.980 --> 01:36:57.140]  thermophilic process. But that's going to leave a tremendous amount of carbon in play. So I was
[01:36:57.140 --> 01:37:02.500]  able to successfully arrested. It's my piles going down. Their pile is still going up. The control
[01:37:02.500 --> 01:37:08.260]  of the controls going up. The test is going down. So I was able to get that first, most important
[01:37:08.260 --> 01:37:14.100]  step done. Next, it's going to be inoculating it with really good biology, both mushroom block as
[01:37:14.100 --> 01:37:20.580]  well as fish brood so that I can get the biological piece in play. And once I do that, now this stuff
[01:37:20.900 --> 01:37:26.980]  is literally by default. We put it on soil and anything will grow there and you'll have a lasting
[01:37:26.980 --> 01:37:32.180]  source of both carbon and nitrogen available in the soil, because that's the other thing is people
[01:37:32.180 --> 01:37:38.020]  don't understand when you smell that commercial compost and it smells like ammonia. That's that's
[01:37:38.020 --> 01:37:46.980]  the thermophytes using carbon and nitrogen and and pooping out ammonia in a volatile gas form.
[01:37:46.980 --> 01:37:51.620]  So you're losing nitrogen when it's the longer it sits there, the more nitrogen you're going to
[01:37:51.620 --> 01:37:58.420]  lose. And with gum, I mean, you hit the nail on the head. It's just this waste stream of fresh
[01:37:58.980 --> 01:38:06.740]  plants. So it's it's all in. And this guy that I'm working with over there, the yard man, Bill,
[01:38:07.380 --> 01:38:10.500]  tells me he goes, all I do is pile this shit up. It'll fucking go off again.
[01:38:10.980 --> 01:38:15.220]  You know, two years old, it's two years old. And if he piles it up, it starts to cook.
[01:38:15.780 --> 01:38:22.820]  So, you know, it's it's it's a real issue. And next year, by the end of 2022,
[01:38:24.180 --> 01:38:31.380]  there will be no more green waste allowed in landfills. So you're talking about 20 to 30
[01:38:31.380 --> 01:38:36.420]  million yards of this shit a year and it's got to go somewhere. Can't go to landfills.
[01:38:37.140 --> 01:38:43.140]  So it's it's a daunting fucking task, but I've been successful so far in getting that first phase
[01:38:43.940 --> 01:38:50.180]  to get it to arrest the thermophilic process so that that carbon and that nitrogen are stored
[01:38:50.180 --> 01:38:56.180]  in a manner that once the biologic piece comes into play, it will release it naturally and safely
[01:38:56.180 --> 01:39:00.980]  back to the plant without killing it. So, you know, again, that's the reason for this conversation
[01:39:00.980 --> 01:39:07.140]  starting tomorrow. And please, Professor, jump on tomorrow. OK, I will. I'll definitely jump on.
[01:39:08.020 --> 01:39:12.500]  Clubhouse on YouTube. There we go.
[01:39:15.750 --> 01:39:24.470]  Wow. And babies. Is that three? Yeah. Oh, yeah, it's three. Is that four? Three. Three.
[01:39:25.030 --> 01:39:38.450]  Definitely three. Wow. Three. Yeah, I see. Is that yours, Mr. Toad?
[01:39:41.090 --> 01:39:47.730]  Peter, where'd you get that pick? Oh, Mr. Toad, when you grew that out,
[01:39:47.730 --> 01:39:52.450]  were those plants viable or was it kind of just fun to grow it out? But then they got extremely
[01:39:52.450 --> 01:40:08.540]  weak as time went on. Scorpius line. We're all sitting on our. There he goes. There's two females
[01:40:08.540 --> 01:40:15.020]  and a male. Holy shit. Mother Nature, she's fucking bad. Were they viable?
[01:40:17.980 --> 01:40:24.920]  Did they grow all the way out? Sounds like he's typing.
[01:40:25.720 --> 01:40:33.080]  Male died. Male died. Wow. Very cool.
[01:40:36.860 --> 01:40:40.940]  There's a friggin mutant for you. Yeah, that's just so weird to see. Like,
[01:40:42.380 --> 01:40:44.140]  Mother Nature sometimes is pretty unique.
[01:40:47.740 --> 01:40:51.180]  But from a genetics point of view, because it is so unique,
[01:40:52.140 --> 01:40:55.340]  I mean, it would be pretty rare for that to be anything viable, right?
[01:40:57.020 --> 01:41:07.180]  Well, sometimes that's how evolution happens. So, I mean, every time there was an evolutionary shift
[01:41:07.180 --> 01:41:14.940]  between any living thing, it started as a mutant and then it passed that genetics along. So, I mean,
[01:41:15.340 --> 01:41:22.540]  that's a prime example of nature doing what nature does. And that's evolving and continuing
[01:41:22.540 --> 01:41:27.980]  to move forward. Fortunately, humans haven't learned that yet, but probably won't.
[01:41:29.900 --> 01:41:31.500]  Too busy stealing each other's money.
[01:41:35.180 --> 01:41:41.100]  Hey, so Professor Bluestash, I saw that you were growing vine supply MV seeds. I've never heard
[01:41:41.100 --> 01:41:45.260]  of that company in my life. And it seemed like they had a really cool looking one called Peanut
[01:41:45.260 --> 01:41:50.380]  Marmalade. I was wondering if we could kind of run a chop it up over that, maybe run about the
[01:41:50.380 --> 01:41:56.540]  genetics and why you chose to run that. Because I do feel like you have a strong knowledge on that.
[01:41:56.540 --> 01:42:01.420]  And so the ones that you're choosing, especially if I guess myself, at least I'd never heard of,
[01:42:01.420 --> 01:42:04.540]  I love learning more about people out there that seem like they're doing the work.
[01:42:05.500 --> 01:42:12.620]  Yeah, thank you. Yeah, you know, shout out Divine Supply, you know, Big Ups, man, that stuff was
[01:42:12.620 --> 01:42:17.340]  really beautiful. A lot of beautiful stuff. I just did some Soul Rebel testers that were
[01:42:17.340 --> 01:42:23.580]  really beautiful too. But that Peanut Marmalade, the reason I was attracted to it was two reasons.
[01:42:24.780 --> 01:42:31.820]  One, the Trop F2, which is the female, which is a Tropicana purple leaning phenotype,
[01:42:32.460 --> 01:42:38.300]  was crossed with the Peanut Butter Breath, male, that was gotten from some seeds from Thug Pug.
[01:42:39.100 --> 01:42:44.940]  So, you know, you got those two kind of crossing in there. And we all know Peanut Butter Breath
[01:42:44.940 --> 01:42:51.020]  has that phenomenal yield and that and known for washing well. And then we got the Trop F2,
[01:42:51.020 --> 01:42:58.060]  which is bringing in purple, rosin, and hash. So my thought was, and I think that's what
[01:42:58.060 --> 01:43:03.580]  Divine Supply was going for, was trying to find a nice sort of balance and it washes nice,
[01:43:03.580 --> 01:43:10.540]  but it still gives off that beautiful purple color. And if you go to Divine Supply's page,
[01:43:10.540 --> 01:43:17.340]  you'll see he has amazing pics of the wash water, the rosin, that just looks amazing. You know,
[01:43:17.340 --> 01:43:22.060]  I think that it's just whenever you get something that's different, I definitely want to go for it.
[01:43:22.060 --> 01:43:29.900]  So that's why I did that one. And it was extremely tolerant of this issue I was having in
[01:43:29.900 --> 01:43:37.420]  one of the beds. It grew very well. And it also seemed to frost up without any sort of burning
[01:43:37.420 --> 01:43:42.940]  on its tips. It did not mind being fed pretty heavily too. So definitely like that one.
[01:43:42.940 --> 01:43:45.180]  Dr. Justin Marchegiani
[01:43:45.180 --> 01:43:49.180]  Real quick, are there some other like smaller time genetics that you kind of want to give a
[01:43:49.180 --> 01:43:54.460]  shout out to? So maybe, you know, the newer viewers can have a little more people to research
[01:43:54.460 --> 01:43:58.780]  than just, you know, the few guys that seem to hype on social media.
[01:43:58.780 --> 01:43:59.420]  Dr. Andrew Hill
[01:43:59.420 --> 01:44:05.740]  I feel you. I feel you. And I'm always looking for people that like to do regular seed. I like
[01:44:05.740 --> 01:44:12.620]  to find males. I like regular genetics. It makes me feel that, you know, that I'm safe with those
[01:44:12.620 --> 01:44:16.940]  where I'm like, Femme is cool. And we can talk about that. If it will be a problem down the road,
[01:44:16.940 --> 01:44:21.900]  it doesn't matter. But the people that are doing it regular, I appreciate them. So, you know, again,
[01:44:22.700 --> 01:44:30.540]  Lorax305, I think 305. I'm sorry, Lorax. I'm so bad with numbers. He's great. Rising Moon. If
[01:44:30.540 --> 01:44:36.220]  you guys have checked out a lot Rising Moon genetics, his are amazing. 315. Sorry, Lorax315.
[01:44:36.220 --> 01:44:38.140]  He's always pumping out great stuff.
[01:44:38.140 --> 01:44:39.980]  Dr. Justin Marchegiani
[01:44:39.980 --> 01:44:43.820]  I asked you this question a little bit before. Can we go a little deeper with Rising Moon?
[01:44:43.820 --> 01:44:44.620]  Dr. Andrew Hill
[01:44:44.620 --> 01:44:50.780]  Yes. Rising Moon is a DEM Pure certified. You know, shout out to him. He was one of our
[01:44:50.780 --> 01:44:59.260]  sponsors for the Compost Cup. And he does amazing, amazing dry farming and a little bit more intensive
[01:44:59.260 --> 01:45:05.660]  farming. The stuff that he was doing with the testers on the hemp and the terpenes and the
[01:45:05.660 --> 01:45:11.260]  tests that he was getting back and then the results on his rosin were ridiculous for dry farming,
[01:45:11.260 --> 01:45:17.980]  in my opinion, and some of the other sort of regenerative things he's doing. And he's breeding
[01:45:17.980 --> 01:45:24.300]  from Michigan, right? He's from Michigan. So you have this sort of special area where up here,
[01:45:24.300 --> 01:45:29.020]  it's so moist that most genetics that we get, even if you're trying to grow them indoors,
[01:45:29.020 --> 01:45:34.220]  they don't work very well, or they get a lot of rot, especially a lot of the stuff that is like
[01:45:34.220 --> 01:45:39.500]  more lemony and citrusy and stuff like that. It tends to get a little bit more rotted up here.
[01:45:40.140 --> 01:45:46.060]  But, you know, you compare that to like, California, we're always like 30-40% humidity,
[01:45:46.060 --> 01:45:52.460]  unless it's raining, you know, here, sometimes in the summer, it's 90% humidity, 80% humidity.
[01:45:53.420 --> 01:46:00.860]  Try to find me a cultivar that can take that. It's like from California, not very many. So,
[01:46:00.860 --> 01:46:06.220]  you know, we deal with a very specific things here. So that's why I like to go with people
[01:46:06.220 --> 01:46:12.620]  around here. Another reason I chose vine supplies, because he's up in Massachusetts,
[01:46:13.420 --> 01:46:20.300]  up there where there's a lot of good foggy weather to keep his plants resistant to that.
[01:46:23.180 --> 01:46:27.660]  Massachusetts and New England is just like you, you're basically the same exact thing. It's the
[01:46:27.660 --> 01:46:33.580]  humidity. So I would probably say you guys should look at Maine. Maine's a wonderful
[01:46:34.540 --> 01:46:38.540]  work coming out of there, as well as Massachusetts and a little bit out of Vermont,
[01:46:38.540 --> 01:46:45.180]  New Hampshire. But yeah, there you go. That's where you really find another cultivar that would
[01:46:45.180 --> 01:46:51.500]  work well in your state. What do you think about some of these breeders that are saying like,
[01:46:51.500 --> 01:46:55.660]  yeah, my stuff, bud rot resistant, my stuff spider mite resistant.
[01:46:57.100 --> 01:46:59.980]  Do you believe there's any validity to that? Or again, that's just
[01:47:00.700 --> 01:47:05.980]  bullshit. Man, I think a lot of it is. And I think since really, you know,
[01:47:05.980 --> 01:47:09.580]  since Angel really hits that on the head a lot of the time, you know,
[01:47:10.700 --> 01:47:18.700]  we're to prove something is resistant. First off, you got to really nail that in and do a study on
[01:47:18.700 --> 01:47:24.780]  it so that you can have reproducible results that you can show someone to put that on your strain.
[01:47:24.780 --> 01:47:30.060]  So it's like, it's funny, because you know, of agriculture, it's like very stringent in some
[01:47:30.060 --> 01:47:35.020]  places, right? But in cannabis, they're always going like, oh, yeah, I found this, I found that.
[01:47:35.020 --> 01:47:41.900]  Now, is there some sort of truth to this? I do think there is. I think that a lot of the stuff
[01:47:41.900 --> 01:47:46.540]  that we're breeding for indoors is it has a lack of systolethic hairs, which is a non-glandular
[01:47:46.540 --> 01:47:51.820]  trichome. And it could if you have a lot of different phenos in a room, a lot of different
[01:47:51.820 --> 01:47:57.500]  genomes, you could think that it was resistant because they just didn't want to go on it.
[01:47:57.500 --> 01:48:03.900]  Right. So again, maybe a change in their vocabulary where it might just be not preferred.
[01:48:04.460 --> 01:48:09.020]  But I do I think that some of them could be right, maybe in some ways, you know, I'd like to
[01:48:09.020 --> 01:48:15.260]  think that some plants are able to be that way. But when it comes up to powdery mildew and stuff
[01:48:15.260 --> 01:48:22.760]  like that, I'm very skeptical. Yeah. And unfortunately, I feel like especially in
[01:48:22.760 --> 01:48:28.760]  Oklahoma, a lot of people were getting kind of hosed by those individuals, like you just mentioned,
[01:48:28.760 --> 01:48:33.640]  saying that their stuff was powdery mildew resistant. And then they would show me a tent,
[01:48:33.640 --> 01:48:37.240]  basically, that they were growing in huge tent, by the way, I can't imagine what that cost.
[01:48:38.120 --> 01:48:41.960]  And it was just it looked like Christmas morning in there. And he's like, well, I thought, you know,
[01:48:41.960 --> 01:48:46.280]  the guy told me these were resistant and all this kind of stuff. And I was like, man, I've
[01:48:46.280 --> 01:48:51.320]  never heard a breeder ever claim that in my life. Now I'm starting to see it more and more where
[01:48:51.320 --> 01:48:56.280]  people are making certain claims where and I guess that's why we could talk about it on the show is
[01:48:56.280 --> 01:49:00.920]  no one's calling them out on that shit. And I just wanted to kind of confirm with the community
[01:49:00.920 --> 01:49:06.120]  because I've you know, I don't I don't necessarily I'm not a breeder by any means, you know, so I
[01:49:06.120 --> 01:49:10.120]  sometimes when this stuff comes out, I'm like, oh, maybe they have really dialed in this stuff.
[01:49:10.120 --> 01:49:13.720]  And then you do a little more research on it. Like, man, this looks like bullshit again.
[01:49:13.720 --> 01:49:19.880]  You know, so I appreciate everybody, including Mr. Toad, just dispelling the rumors or the
[01:49:19.880 --> 01:49:23.000]  bullshit out there that back in the day would have probably taken a year
[01:49:23.720 --> 01:49:26.840]  to dispel or like finally somebody is like, no, that's bullshit.
[01:49:28.680 --> 01:49:35.320]  So do you guys want to kind of get into like, what do you think the future of cannabis? Do you
[01:49:35.320 --> 01:49:40.840]  think you know, do you think mutants are going to have their place kind of like as they're evolving
[01:49:40.840 --> 01:49:45.400]  more and more people are kind of figure things out the same way maybe auto flowers are starting
[01:49:45.400 --> 01:49:52.920]  to seem like making sense for some people in the market? I definitely think, you know, from from
[01:49:52.920 --> 01:49:58.440]  just an ancillary point of view, you know, as we're working towards legalization, we're going
[01:49:58.440 --> 01:50:05.000]  to have a lot more different avenues for people who grow cannabis or breed cannabis to make money
[01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:10.760]  without directly being involved with production and things like that. So I think that this has
[01:50:11.320 --> 01:50:18.760]  very high value that for making landscape plants, or you know, people buying cannabis, like they buy
[01:50:18.760 --> 01:50:23.400]  the kale, they buy the flowering kale, and you buy some crazy stuff like this. And even though,
[01:50:23.400 --> 01:50:27.240]  okay, it's like two, three bucks a pop. That's how much you're going to sell a regular clone for
[01:50:27.240 --> 01:50:32.760]  anyway. And people will buy that from, you know, some of these other stores, these garden centers.
[01:50:32.760 --> 01:50:37.560]  So I think that, yes, they do have that. And I do think for uniqueness that they will stay around.
[01:50:38.280 --> 01:50:43.960]  As far as auto flowers, I've been extremely interested in seeing how they've evolved. I mean,
[01:50:44.680 --> 01:50:49.960]  nowadays, the autos are actually really good. Whereas before you could just talk smack about
[01:50:49.960 --> 01:50:56.040]  them all day, and they could never really come to the table. And auto flowers for me, though,
[01:50:56.600 --> 01:51:02.040]  are a whole other beast. You know, they definitely require less nutrients, and I've not been able to
[01:51:02.040 --> 01:51:09.160]  dial them in perfectly. I think the key is to just don't do anything. Just fucking plant it,
[01:51:09.160 --> 01:51:15.320]  let them be. That's what I've heard is the key to auto flowers. And the reason that most cannabis
[01:51:15.320 --> 01:51:20.440]  growers don't like them is because it's too fucking easy. They've worked their whole life
[01:51:20.440 --> 01:51:25.160]  to figure this shit out, right? And then you get to come along and plant this thing and bam,
[01:51:25.160 --> 01:51:31.400]  you're gonna have something as good as my work. And in some cases, it's the truth. And I think
[01:51:31.400 --> 01:51:38.280]  that, you know, I agree with you, Juan Stasch. I think that once we see finally prohibition ended
[01:51:38.280 --> 01:51:43.640]  across this country, that there's going to be a lot of people that just grow them because they're
[01:51:43.640 --> 01:51:48.280]  pretty. They're really cool plants. They attract a lot of interesting insects. I mean, when we used
[01:51:48.280 --> 01:51:54.200]  to grow back in Mass, we'd get these neon-colored little bugs that were multicolored. I don't know
[01:51:54.200 --> 01:52:00.440]  if you get those out there in Michigan. Freaking gorgeous bugs. And they don't harm the plant.
[01:52:00.440 --> 01:52:05.800]  They're there to eat any aphids or anything that's on them. So they're actually a good predator to
[01:52:05.800 --> 01:52:11.320]  have on your plant. And if you've got a healthy plant, you have them. So I could definitely see
[01:52:11.320 --> 01:52:17.240]  the future of just using this landscape material because it does grow big and beautiful. And,
[01:52:17.240 --> 01:52:22.040]  you know, maybe not everybody likes the smell of it, but I love the fucking smell of a cannabis.
[01:52:23.560 --> 01:52:26.840]  Unfortunately, like I said, I can't hear it because I signed a lease that,
[01:52:27.560 --> 01:52:32.200]  and I agreed with the landlord that I wouldn't. So I'm not going to go back on my word.
[01:52:34.920 --> 01:52:38.600]  Hopefully someday I'll be able to start growing again, but right now I can't.
[01:52:40.040 --> 01:52:44.040]  There's nothing better than trimming all day and then going and having a steak dinner and
[01:52:44.040 --> 01:52:50.920]  having the whole restaurant look at you like, what the fuck? You just smell so fresh and so clean.
[01:52:51.800 --> 01:52:54.680]  So shout out to everybody in Trim Trail.
[01:52:54.680 --> 01:53:01.640]  Layton, hopefully in about two months we'll have 25,000 square feet of space to work with.
[01:53:02.200 --> 01:53:07.000]  Yep. I know, brother. I know. And I'll have my truck and I'll be pumping out
[01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:09.240]  fucking compost extract like a motherfucker.
[01:53:13.000 --> 01:53:16.280]  Do you have some, Peter, do you have some mutants on your desk?
[01:53:18.440 --> 01:53:19.240]  Is that what that is?
[01:53:19.960 --> 01:53:24.200]  Yeah, no, those are the ABCs that we were talking about in the beginning.
[01:53:24.760 --> 01:53:26.840]  Although I don't know how good the lighting is in here, but...
[01:53:28.520 --> 01:53:32.920]  I don't think a lot of people have seen that, even though it's like from the 60s, 70s.
[01:53:33.800 --> 01:53:38.360]  Yeah, actually, you know what? I could get better lighting on it, but...
[01:53:42.210 --> 01:53:44.290]  Well, yeah, I don't know where the...
[01:53:44.290 --> 01:53:47.970]  Soon enough, dude, you'll have your studio with all the lighting you need and everything else.
[01:53:48.690 --> 01:53:49.190]  Right?
[01:53:50.850 --> 01:53:54.530]  I need another camera. Well, actually, I could close up.
[01:53:54.530 --> 01:53:57.810]  But anyway, that's... I'll get a better picture of it later.
[01:53:58.770 --> 01:54:03.570]  I think the viewers can see why maybe police, law enforcement, especially back in the day,
[01:54:03.570 --> 01:54:07.490]  wouldn't know that that was a cannabis plant just from the, you know, the two that you have there.
[01:54:08.210 --> 01:54:13.730]  I want to have these in my yard. I mean, literally, the street is right here.
[01:54:13.810 --> 01:54:19.570]  And I just want to see if anybody realizes what it is, which I assume they won't.
[01:54:21.970 --> 01:54:24.450]  I can't imagine, unless you're a cannabis farmer,
[01:54:24.450 --> 01:54:26.370]  that you would have any idea what that was.
[01:54:26.370 --> 01:54:27.970]  Now, if you pinch them, do they smell?
[01:54:29.730 --> 01:54:30.290]  Right now?
[01:54:33.780 --> 01:54:34.900]  The good ones should, right?
[01:54:37.700 --> 01:54:38.260]  Not really.
[01:54:39.540 --> 01:54:40.100]  There you go.
[01:54:41.940 --> 01:54:43.940]  What do you think about that, Professor Bluntstache?
[01:54:43.940 --> 01:54:47.460]  That was like another way the old heads would talk about when they were running down the clones.
[01:54:47.460 --> 01:54:48.900]  They would kind of rub the stalk.
[01:54:48.900 --> 01:54:54.100]  Or I also used to see them always take a fan leaf and see if they could taste sweetness to it.
[01:54:54.900 --> 01:54:58.180]  Do you think there is some basis to, like, these genetics are going to be better,
[01:54:58.820 --> 01:55:01.220]  even though that might be an old wise tale or something like that,
[01:55:01.220 --> 01:55:04.980]  just by a steb rum, especially at the veg state, early veg state?
[01:55:06.260 --> 01:55:08.980]  I would say that this is two-folded.
[01:55:08.980 --> 01:55:13.220]  You know, at first, maybe some people say it's completely false.
[01:55:13.220 --> 01:55:14.420]  I don't think so.
[01:55:14.420 --> 01:55:20.500]  At the beginning, yeah, I think that it probably doesn't have much validity.
[01:55:20.500 --> 01:55:24.260]  But as plants get towards maturity, sexual maturity,
[01:55:24.260 --> 01:55:27.780]  I definitely notice that they change their stem rub.
[01:55:27.780 --> 01:55:32.180]  And I've noticed that the plants that look phenotypically similar
[01:55:32.180 --> 01:55:34.980]  have a similar stem rub in some way.
[01:55:34.980 --> 01:55:38.900]  So I definitely think that's a way to be able to tell it.
[01:55:38.900 --> 01:55:41.940]  Now, another thing that I've heard that's very interesting
[01:55:41.940 --> 01:55:44.660]  is the Rev. I don't know if you guys have heard of the Rev.
[01:55:45.540 --> 01:55:47.220]  Of course, he made the TLO book.
[01:55:48.100 --> 01:55:50.580]  You know, a lot of people, I get a lot of people, like,
[01:55:50.580 --> 01:55:54.900]  started on some of that material to understand simple living soil.
[01:55:54.900 --> 01:55:58.820]  And he had talked about how when you actually take a microscope
[01:55:58.820 --> 01:56:00.900]  and you even look at when it just sprouts,
[01:56:00.900 --> 01:56:04.980]  and you look at the cotyledon, and you look there and you see how many
[01:56:04.980 --> 01:56:09.460]  of these specific, you know, non-glandular trichomes
[01:56:09.460 --> 01:56:11.620]  or whatever sort of structures are there.
[01:56:12.100 --> 01:56:13.140]  And he counts them.
[01:56:13.940 --> 01:56:19.140]  And then, as the plants get older, he saw that the ones that have the more
[01:56:19.140 --> 01:56:23.460]  were able to have more resin glands or seem to be better specimens.
[01:56:24.500 --> 01:56:27.620]  Now, I think that might have some truth to it as well.
[01:56:28.660 --> 01:56:32.980]  I think that there's all sorts of little tricks and tips that we don't know about.
[01:56:32.980 --> 01:56:36.500]  But I do think the stem rub, I think the old timers are right.
[01:56:36.500 --> 01:56:40.660]  But I've had some crazy stem rubs.
[01:56:40.660 --> 01:56:46.180]  Pickle stem rubs, some lemon stem rubs, got like sock stem rubs.
[01:56:46.180 --> 01:56:49.780]  You got like just kind of good old-fashioned florally stem rubs.
[01:56:51.060 --> 01:56:52.660]  So I definitely like it.
[01:56:53.300 --> 01:56:55.540]  But it has to be a very specific time.
[01:56:56.340 --> 01:56:59.860]  You know, you can't just do it right at the beginning.
[01:56:59.860 --> 01:57:03.220]  You know, you can't just do it when it's huge, giant stock.
[01:57:03.220 --> 01:57:04.420]  And now it's like a giant plant.
[01:57:04.420 --> 01:57:06.260]  You're not going to really get anything off that.
[01:57:06.260 --> 01:57:10.980]  I found that it has to be like a specific, almost like in between
[01:57:12.180 --> 01:57:16.340]  the vegetative and the flowering is when it starts again.
[01:57:16.340 --> 01:57:20.180]  And it's on like the material right before you start to clone.
[01:57:20.180 --> 01:57:23.300]  So kind of go down a little bit, kind of that fresher stuff.
[01:57:23.940 --> 01:57:25.460]  I feel like that's where it smells.
[01:57:26.820 --> 01:57:29.940]  And then, how do you feel about when the old timers would say like,
[01:57:29.940 --> 01:57:31.780]  granted, they didn't have a lot of space or stuff.
[01:57:31.780 --> 01:57:35.140]  So they would say like, all right, when we're phenohunting, we go through our seeds.
[01:57:35.140 --> 01:57:37.860]  We only grow tiger eye because we don't waste our time.
[01:57:37.860 --> 01:57:39.620]  Do you feel like there's validity to that?
[01:57:39.620 --> 01:57:42.820]  Or do you feel like that's just old head talk?
[01:57:44.820 --> 01:57:46.820]  You know, I'm not sure about that one, honestly.
[01:57:48.260 --> 01:57:51.860]  But I think that these old timers got some sort of sixth sense.
[01:57:52.740 --> 01:57:53.540]  I don't know where they.
[01:57:55.700 --> 01:57:59.940]  They would only grow the fatter tiger eye seeds.
[01:58:00.740 --> 01:58:04.020]  And then they would actually give the rest to like our little group and stuff.
[01:58:04.020 --> 01:58:08.260]  But yeah, they seem like they didn't mind spending a lot of money on them and then just
[01:58:08.260 --> 01:58:12.260]  taking like four or five out of the thing and then either selling them to us or hooking us up
[01:58:12.260 --> 01:58:13.300]  with them and that kind of thing.
[01:58:13.300 --> 01:58:15.700]  So I always wondered about that.
[01:58:15.700 --> 01:58:19.700]  I've never had somebody that I could get a definitive answer on that because some people
[01:58:19.700 --> 01:58:25.220]  have claimed, well, no, I've gotten some unique stuff from smaller seeds that definitely didn't
[01:58:25.220 --> 01:58:26.340]  have the tiger eye on them.
[01:58:26.980 --> 01:58:32.260]  To where sometimes you have you ever seen like some of those false seeds that can sometimes,
[01:58:32.980 --> 01:58:37.860]  it seems like when heavy stress is on and then somebody was saying that they tried to grow those
[01:58:37.860 --> 01:58:41.220]  out before it would pop, but it was it wasn't anything viable.
[01:58:42.580 --> 01:58:48.740]  So it just kind of intrigues me how seeds can potentially be a home run, but at the same time,
[01:58:48.740 --> 01:58:49.860]  there's really nothing to it.
[01:58:50.660 --> 01:58:56.020]  And the amount of time it takes, especially as a new farmer, to discover this for yourself,
[01:58:56.020 --> 01:59:00.180]  that's something I always try to give to the community is if you can pick your genetics
[01:59:00.180 --> 01:59:06.340]  from the beginning and at least have a solid plan in place, I feel like you are going to be
[01:59:07.300 --> 01:59:12.900]  more enthusiastic to phenohunt in the future than just going out there and getting some
[01:59:12.900 --> 01:59:15.700]  bag seed this day and age and running through that.
[01:59:15.700 --> 01:59:18.180]  Most of the time, unfortunately, it's a waste of time.
[01:59:19.940 --> 01:59:23.540]  You know, I do have a little input on the seeds.
[01:59:23.540 --> 01:59:28.340]  Michael and Brianna reinforced this, talked a lot about this.
[01:59:28.340 --> 01:59:32.260]  And he would always squeeze it as hard as he could.
[01:59:33.060 --> 01:59:36.100]  And if it passed that test, then it was a viable seed.
[01:59:36.740 --> 01:59:42.260]  So he had done the work on this in the past to understand what he should pass along to his
[01:59:42.260 --> 01:59:46.340]  clients, his modern epigenetics.
[01:59:46.340 --> 01:59:51.780]  And Blunt Stache, I'd love you to freaking get the, I think it's called Hindi mentality.
[01:59:52.420 --> 01:59:54.660]  I'm going to get some of those from Amata Peter's place.
[01:59:55.140 --> 02:00:00.980]  It's just a freaking wonderful, heady, thought-provoking high.
[02:00:02.180 --> 02:00:08.900]  But anyway, there's my two cents on seeds that if you can't crush them, they're going to be
[02:00:08.900 --> 02:00:09.620]  a viable plant.
[02:00:10.260 --> 02:00:11.780]  I'm not sure about the Tiger Eye.
[02:00:12.660 --> 02:00:18.100]  And I'm not sure about, like, I know if it's too small, get rid of it.
[02:00:18.100 --> 02:00:22.980]  But even if it's a little smaller than the biggest one, it's still viable.
[02:00:23.060 --> 02:00:24.580]  At least that's what the way he explained it.
[02:00:24.580 --> 02:00:30.180]  And that makes sense, too, because the, you know, other people would say, like, all right,
[02:00:30.180 --> 02:00:32.740]  if they're viable seeds, put them in a little shot glass.
[02:00:32.740 --> 02:00:35.140]  If there's floats at the bottom, those are the ones you want.
[02:00:35.140 --> 02:00:38.740]  If they're hanging on the top, those aren't even worth growing.
[02:00:39.300 --> 02:00:41.140]  And again, some people agree with that.
[02:00:41.140 --> 02:00:42.340]  Some people say that's bullshit.
[02:00:42.340 --> 02:00:46.580]  The ones that are floating might not necessarily have floated to the, or sank to the bottom,
[02:00:46.580 --> 02:00:48.580]  but are still viable floating at the top.
[02:00:50.020 --> 02:00:51.380]  Maybe Mr. Toad's still listening.
[02:00:51.700 --> 02:00:54.340]  He's definitely got more seed experience than all of us combined.
[02:00:54.340 --> 02:00:57.380]  So maybe he could talk about that.
[02:00:58.180 --> 02:01:00.020]  But yeah, it would be good to know.
[02:01:00.020 --> 02:01:05.060]  I mean, I feel like the shot glass approach for me, and then I would put a little fulvic
[02:01:05.060 --> 02:01:07.620]  acid in there, that seemed like tried and true.
[02:01:08.340 --> 02:01:13.060]  And then as the plant started to grow a little bit and sprout, I would, once it got its true
[02:01:13.060 --> 02:01:15.620]  leaves, I would foiler feed with some kelp.
[02:01:15.620 --> 02:01:20.340]  And then that for me was how, you know, I would get things kind of off and rocking before
[02:01:20.340 --> 02:01:21.380]  living soil even.
[02:01:21.380 --> 02:01:25.620]  And then like you had mentioned, being able to take a rooted plant and then just sticking
[02:01:25.620 --> 02:01:29.460]  it in the living soil and kind of like, okay, now what do I do?
[02:01:29.460 --> 02:01:32.900]  We've always joked, right now, go outside, enjoy life, be with your family.
[02:01:32.900 --> 02:01:35.620]  You know, you don't have to sit here and mix shit all day anymore.
[02:01:35.620 --> 02:01:37.940]  Living soil is a whole different animal with this.
[02:01:37.940 --> 02:01:42.420]  Or I feel like if you are an older cannabis farmer, or you've just been farming in general,
[02:01:43.140 --> 02:01:46.740]  pH is so important to you and dialing in your nutrients.
[02:01:46.740 --> 02:01:48.980]  That's why everybody hoards their recipes and stuff.
[02:01:48.980 --> 02:01:53.300]  Because it takes sometimes people years to figure that shit out on what products they
[02:01:53.300 --> 02:01:55.700]  want to use and what things they want to use at certain times.
[02:01:55.700 --> 02:02:01.780]  And they do farm the plant week by week in a way where a living soil farmer is just constantly
[02:02:01.780 --> 02:02:06.740]  thinking about the future and being a proactive farmer saying, all right, what can I do to
[02:02:06.740 --> 02:02:08.500]  improve these things for next year?
[02:02:08.500 --> 02:02:13.700]  And as times progress, how can I get these plants at least healthy enough to be somewhat
[02:02:13.700 --> 02:02:15.620]  resistant to pests and disease?
[02:02:15.940 --> 02:02:19.040]  That's a great point.
[02:02:19.680 --> 02:02:23.040]  Now, I do have one more comment.
[02:02:23.040 --> 02:02:29.120]  You know, I do agree that if something is going through a process of being squeezed,
[02:02:29.120 --> 02:02:33.840]  it's going to have a much higher chance of being a winner, I've seen, and also just be
[02:02:33.840 --> 02:02:36.080]  able to actually germinate properly.
[02:02:36.080 --> 02:02:40.400]  Now, the second note is, again, with these tiger scrapes, what I've noticed, so from
[02:02:40.400 --> 02:02:45.120]  my own experience, just a little bit that I didn't get to mention was, you can take
[02:02:45.680 --> 02:02:48.640]  that layer off, right?
[02:02:48.640 --> 02:02:52.960]  Like you can almost make it not have the tiger stripes anymore.
[02:02:53.520 --> 02:03:00.960]  But what if you're using some sort of industrial winnower or some sort of industrial that's
[02:03:00.960 --> 02:03:03.760]  going to be cracking it a little bit and scarifying it?
[02:03:03.760 --> 02:03:08.080]  Or maybe your scarifier is not right and it's taking off that layer with it.
[02:03:08.080 --> 02:03:13.840]  Then you can't see the tiger stripe because of the mechanical manipulation.
[02:03:14.000 --> 02:03:15.600]  So I don't know.
[02:03:15.600 --> 02:03:17.920]  It's like that is just a really great question.
[02:03:17.920 --> 02:03:19.360]  So this occurred to him.
[02:03:19.360 --> 02:03:26.960]  You know, another thing, too, is that people have to keep in mind is there is endophytic
[02:03:26.960 --> 02:03:33.120]  bacteria on the coating of the seed that's critical for that plant.
[02:03:33.120 --> 02:03:38.240]  And if you're scarifying it or you're scraping it or, you know, I heard guys used to take
[02:03:38.320 --> 02:03:44.160]  sandpaper and gently sand the coating off the seed, you're potentially losing an
[02:03:44.160 --> 02:03:50.880]  incredible ally in that endophytic bacteria because it's bacteria and fungi that grow
[02:03:50.880 --> 02:03:56.320]  inside the plant and help to strengthen it and aid in all kinds of important processes.
[02:03:56.320 --> 02:04:02.640]  So I generally tell people you should soak the seed in your mouth, just swirl it around
[02:04:02.640 --> 02:04:08.160]  in your own spit, because now you're genetically imprinting your own DNA.
[02:04:08.880 --> 02:04:12.640]  You're putting your DNA onto that seed.
[02:04:13.200 --> 02:04:19.200]  And the theory is that that seed will then express some of the things that are you you
[02:04:19.200 --> 02:04:21.600]  need or perhaps that you want.
[02:04:21.600 --> 02:04:23.200]  It's it's deep shit.
[02:04:23.200 --> 02:04:25.600]  But it's there's some validity to it.
[02:04:25.600 --> 02:04:30.880]  There has been some work done to study, you know, was that vile or not.
[02:04:30.880 --> 02:04:33.440]  And again, I agree with you, Blunt Stache.
[02:04:33.440 --> 02:04:37.600]  The problem with cannabis is there is no governing body.
[02:04:37.600 --> 02:04:42.720]  If I say I can make this plant mold resistant, who's going to prove it?
[02:04:42.720 --> 02:04:47.040]  How many seasons or areas?
[02:04:47.040 --> 02:04:51.600]  Because remember, every area is different, different humidity, different wind patterns.
[02:04:51.600 --> 02:04:57.440]  So it's really kind of a crapshoot that people should be aware of that.
[02:04:57.440 --> 02:05:03.520]  If someone starts saying how resistant this is or it's you know, it doesn't get power
[02:05:04.240 --> 02:05:09.200]  mildew, just be careful and understand that, you know, that may be true in their area,
[02:05:09.200 --> 02:05:11.120]  but it doesn't mean it's going to be true for you.
[02:05:14.000 --> 02:05:15.600]  But anyway, sorry to go on a rant.
[02:05:17.040 --> 02:05:21.520]  I kind of want to add if that's the first thing they lead into is like this stuff is
[02:05:21.520 --> 02:05:23.040]  resistant to this and that.
[02:05:23.040 --> 02:05:25.200]  I would say those are huge red flags.
[02:05:26.080 --> 02:05:30.720]  And there are some people, unfortunately, I guess around the country that seem to be
[02:05:30.720 --> 02:05:36.240]  doing this because more and more people are starting to ask like, oh, is it pest resistant?
[02:05:36.240 --> 02:05:40.160]  Is it, you know, I mean, there's so many factors and variables on that, that the fact
[02:05:40.160 --> 02:05:45.040]  that certain breeders are claiming yes to that, I just, I felt like that was almost
[02:05:45.040 --> 02:05:46.080]  borderline appalling.
[02:05:46.080 --> 02:05:54.720]  Remember, pest resistance has more to do with plant health than anything else.
[02:05:56.320 --> 02:05:58.160]  You got to understand the way nature works.
[02:05:59.120 --> 02:06:06.640]  If that plant's not suitable for consumption by another organism, then nature attacks it
[02:06:06.640 --> 02:06:09.920]  and takes it out of play and recycles it back into soil.
[02:06:10.560 --> 02:06:13.760]  And so that's the whole system, man.
[02:06:14.320 --> 02:06:19.040]  And you start fucking with that and spraying pesticides because you're growing unhealthy
[02:06:19.040 --> 02:06:19.520]  plants.
[02:06:20.240 --> 02:06:24.880]  Well, you're going in the wrong direction and you're polluting the environment and
[02:06:24.880 --> 02:06:30.560]  you're not allowing nature to do what she needs to do, which is not allow this plant
[02:06:30.560 --> 02:06:32.960]  to continue to grow.
[02:06:32.960 --> 02:06:34.960]  So it will be consumed by something.
[02:06:34.960 --> 02:06:37.840]  And that goes back to right, right back to health.
[02:06:37.840 --> 02:06:39.200]  You know, we talked about human health.
[02:06:39.200 --> 02:06:45.760]  If you're consuming plants that have been sprayed with any kind of insecticide, how
[02:06:45.760 --> 02:06:46.960]  is it affecting you?
[02:06:46.960 --> 02:06:49.200]  Like you just heard me talk about atrazine.
[02:06:49.760 --> 02:06:51.920]  Atrazine is frigging horrible chemical.
[02:06:51.920 --> 02:06:56.640]  And it's it lasts for a long, long, long time, like these forever chemicals that in
[02:06:56.640 --> 02:07:01.120]  our I'm going to shut up right now because I'm going to get messed up.
[02:07:02.480 --> 02:07:05.440]  No, I think I think you're bringing up some good points.
[02:07:05.440 --> 02:07:11.600]  And, you know, something that you said made me think of earlier, you know, like the gum,
[02:07:11.600 --> 02:07:13.040]  the ground up organic matter.
[02:07:14.000 --> 02:07:17.840]  Now, this is what most places are getting to create compost.
[02:07:17.840 --> 02:07:18.080]  Right.
[02:07:18.800 --> 02:07:25.440]  And I think that we are hard pressed to find gum or any sort of organic material that is
[02:07:25.440 --> 02:07:26.880]  free of all these chemicals.
[02:07:27.520 --> 02:07:33.520]  So I guess one question I might have for you is, you know, how do you feel like these things
[02:07:33.520 --> 02:07:34.320]  are broken down?
[02:07:34.320 --> 02:07:37.120]  And do you feel like they most likely are?
[02:07:37.120 --> 02:07:44.560]  Because I don't see someone being able to pretty much get all organic matter to put
[02:07:44.560 --> 02:07:45.520]  into these compost.
[02:07:45.520 --> 02:07:49.200]  But then we still put them into these systems commercially and they still pass.
[02:07:50.080 --> 02:07:50.480]  Right.
[02:07:50.480 --> 02:07:54.080]  So where where in the equation is this happening?
[02:07:54.080 --> 02:07:59.440]  Are are these microbes breaking down a lot of these pesticides, herbicides and things?
[02:07:59.440 --> 02:08:02.000]  And have you guys seen any good research on it?
[02:08:02.000 --> 02:08:07.600]  Because I feel as though this is something that, you know, they really wants to be avoided
[02:08:07.600 --> 02:08:09.680]  by some of the management.
[02:08:10.640 --> 02:08:13.840]  Okay, so to answer your question, absolutely.
[02:08:13.840 --> 02:08:14.720]  It's the microbes.
[02:08:15.600 --> 02:08:20.240]  I did a project a number of years back in Chattanooga, Tennessee.
[02:08:20.880 --> 02:08:23.760]  It was basically a car dealership for 50 years.
[02:08:24.320 --> 02:08:28.960]  And just like your dad or whoever it was, there were floor drains.
[02:08:29.840 --> 02:08:34.320]  Everything went down into the earth underneath this giant car dealership.
[02:08:34.320 --> 02:08:37.920]  All the all the fluids, degreasers.
[02:08:37.920 --> 02:08:38.640]  It didn't matter.
[02:08:38.640 --> 02:08:41.680]  They just wash it down into the floor, floor drains.
[02:08:42.400 --> 02:08:47.200]  So the dealership couldn't be sold because they knew they were going to have to do a
[02:08:47.200 --> 02:08:51.600]  21E, which is an environmental study to see how bad the soil was.
[02:08:52.320 --> 02:08:58.560]  So the dealership, the owners got real smart and they basically donated the land to the
[02:08:58.560 --> 02:08:58.880]  state.
[02:09:00.000 --> 02:09:01.600]  And so the state got this.
[02:09:02.400 --> 02:09:07.120]  They got a beautiful tax write off and the state got this toxic fucking waste site.
[02:09:08.000 --> 02:09:09.920]  So the state knocks down the building.
[02:09:10.720 --> 02:09:15.040]  They get a hire a landscape architect to come in because this was right on a river, even
[02:09:15.040 --> 02:09:15.760]  more scary.
[02:09:16.480 --> 02:09:23.200]  And he decided, you know, you're going to do parks here, walking trails here, you know,
[02:09:23.200 --> 02:09:24.080]  berms over here.
[02:09:24.080 --> 02:09:28.720]  This is going to be planted with trees, you know, a really nice, beautiful, you know,
[02:09:28.720 --> 02:09:29.040]  park.
[02:09:30.000 --> 02:09:36.720]  And so then they hired the excavators to come in and start mounding and shaping the future
[02:09:36.800 --> 02:09:37.040]  park.
[02:09:37.760 --> 02:09:42.320]  And this one guy, I believe he died.
[02:09:43.040 --> 02:09:49.760]  He was he was plowing, you know, with a bulldozer and the fumes that were coming up caused him
[02:09:49.760 --> 02:09:52.000]  to stop breathing.
[02:09:52.640 --> 02:09:56.640]  And the day before he was complaining, you know, that he could barely breathe.
[02:09:56.640 --> 02:09:58.720]  His eyes were burning when he was doing the work.
[02:09:59.440 --> 02:10:04.080]  And again, he went back to work the next day and they rushed him off to the hospital.
[02:10:04.880 --> 02:10:06.640]  And that's when they got me involved.
[02:10:06.640 --> 02:10:09.440]  They called me to say, hey, look, we got a real problem down here.
[02:10:09.440 --> 02:10:11.840]  We need we need some soil biology to clean it up.
[02:10:12.640 --> 02:10:16.160]  And I'm like, all right, send me send me a soil sample so I can see what to come up
[02:10:16.160 --> 02:10:16.400]  against.
[02:10:17.120 --> 02:10:18.000]  Oh, we can't do that.
[02:10:18.560 --> 02:10:25.840]  I'm like, well, how am I supposed to know what kind of biology I need to grow out to
[02:10:25.840 --> 02:10:27.600]  assist in this breakdown?
[02:10:28.640 --> 02:10:32.720]  And they're like, well, we can't we can't let that information out.
[02:10:32.720 --> 02:10:34.400]  And I'm like, well, I'm not going to tell anybody.
[02:10:34.400 --> 02:10:36.720]  I'm just using this for personal use.
[02:10:36.720 --> 02:10:37.200]  They would.
[02:10:37.200 --> 02:10:38.000]  They refused.
[02:10:38.000 --> 02:10:44.320]  But I did get the foreman of the landscape planting company to go out and steal me samples.
[02:10:45.120 --> 02:10:47.040]  So it comes back that it was coal tar.
[02:10:47.040 --> 02:10:48.880]  Now, coal tar is a catch all.
[02:10:49.520 --> 02:10:54.400]  It's basically when these compounds, horribly toxic compounds bond together.
[02:10:54.400 --> 02:10:57.280]  As a matter of fact, I have some right here that I've been.
[02:10:59.280 --> 02:11:01.680]  Have you ever heard of coal tar in my life?
[02:11:01.680 --> 02:11:02.400]  Have you?
[02:11:02.400 --> 02:11:03.520]  This is coal tar.
[02:11:03.520 --> 02:11:05.840]  I've been harvesting these from around here.
[02:11:05.840 --> 02:11:07.760]  There's a this was a drill.
[02:11:07.760 --> 02:11:11.520]  So this comes from extremely toxic things eventually.
[02:11:11.520 --> 02:11:13.600]  They're bonded together.
[02:11:13.600 --> 02:11:18.640]  OK, see these these chunks, they're black and I can break them with my fingers.
[02:11:18.640 --> 02:11:25.200]  So it's it's it's loose, but it bonds together, you know, into clumps.
[02:11:26.000 --> 02:11:32.000]  So anyway, finding out that it was coal tar, I knew that I would probably be needing
[02:11:32.000 --> 02:11:35.840]  Pseudomonas bacteria to do the heavy lifting.
[02:11:36.800 --> 02:11:38.160]  So I called Elaine.
[02:11:38.160 --> 02:11:39.600]  I told her what I was up against.
[02:11:40.240 --> 02:11:43.680]  She gave me a formula for making the compost.
[02:11:43.680 --> 02:11:48.800]  But as she said, you've got to be really careful with this shit, because if you have any ailments,
[02:11:49.840 --> 02:11:51.040]  it's going to come out.
[02:11:51.040 --> 02:11:54.080]  So if you're sick, it's going to make you really fucking sick.
[02:11:54.640 --> 02:11:56.640]  So these guys are not something to fuck around with.
[02:11:57.360 --> 02:12:00.000]  Fortunately, I did not have any issues with them.
[02:12:00.560 --> 02:12:05.520]  And I think a lot of it was due to the fact that I've been playing with aquatic biology
[02:12:05.520 --> 02:12:10.640]  for so many years at that point that I had some resistance to these types of bacteria
[02:12:10.640 --> 02:12:11.920]  or bacterial infections.
[02:12:13.120 --> 02:12:21.280]  In the end, we applied three applications of a product that I used to the compost.
[02:12:21.280 --> 02:12:25.200]  I stripped it, liquefied it and shipped it down there and they applied it with a hydro
[02:12:25.200 --> 02:12:25.600]  seeder.
[02:12:26.240 --> 02:12:31.840]  And at the end of the third application, the biology had taken hold.
[02:12:32.800 --> 02:12:36.160]  The odors were gone and the park was opened.
[02:12:36.160 --> 02:12:40.160]  And so I asked to have another soil sample, but they refused.
[02:12:40.160 --> 02:12:45.920]  And I would have to drive down there and actually do it myself if I wanted to.
[02:12:46.480 --> 02:12:53.520]  I was confident that what was done was appropriate and that at least these were broken into secondary
[02:12:53.520 --> 02:12:54.880]  or tertiary metabolites.
[02:12:55.440 --> 02:13:00.400]  And then most recently, working with Furman University on that atrazine, we did the same
[02:13:00.400 --> 02:13:00.960]  thing.
[02:13:00.960 --> 02:13:04.880]  We broke it down to a point where it was non-detectable in the soil.
[02:13:04.880 --> 02:13:06.800]  So can biology do this?
[02:13:06.800 --> 02:13:07.520]  Absolutely.
[02:13:07.520 --> 02:13:08.400]  How long does it take?
[02:13:08.960 --> 02:13:09.840]  Depends.
[02:13:09.840 --> 02:13:11.600]  It depends on how infested it is.
[02:13:12.160 --> 02:13:18.480]  Now, there was this guy I met probably 10 years ago, really cool cat, had been all over
[02:13:18.480 --> 02:13:25.040]  the world collecting microbes from toxic waste sites, and he was growing them out and using
[02:13:25.040 --> 02:13:27.040]  them to clean the soil in situ.
[02:13:28.400 --> 02:13:31.600]  Unfortunately, he's passed and I don't know what happened to his library.
[02:13:32.480 --> 02:13:33.520]  I lost touch with him.
[02:13:34.080 --> 02:13:40.160]  But that was a similar situation where I was getting involved with some of these environmental
[02:13:40.160 --> 02:13:40.640]  companies.
[02:13:41.200 --> 02:13:42.960]  But they don't want to clean it in situ.
[02:13:42.960 --> 02:13:44.400]  They don't want you to clean it in place.
[02:13:44.400 --> 02:13:50.400]  They want to come in, excavate it, ship it to a fucking other state, burn the fucking
[02:13:50.400 --> 02:13:56.080]  shit, release it into the atmosphere, call it clean, and then haul in all this and fill
[02:13:56.080 --> 02:14:00.880]  the hole they just made because they make millions and millions of dollars off doing
[02:14:00.880 --> 02:14:01.040]  this.
[02:14:02.000 --> 02:14:09.440]  So just recently, I was hit up by the chief scientist at Pitmoss because they're getting
[02:14:09.440 --> 02:14:14.320]  hit up by the US military, DOD, to do in situ cleanups.
[02:14:14.320 --> 02:14:18.960]  And so he knew, Doc knew I was been doing some of this work over the years.
[02:14:18.960 --> 02:14:21.280]  And so he asked me if I would want to get involved with it.
[02:14:21.280 --> 02:14:22.240]  I'm like, hell yeah.
[02:14:23.840 --> 02:14:29.760]  Between myself, Craig Tester, and Lee Folson, we have all kinds of recipes to deal with
[02:14:29.760 --> 02:14:34.160]  the shit, whether it's white rot, whether it's aquatic, or whether it's terrestrial
[02:14:34.160 --> 02:14:34.720]  biology.
[02:14:34.720 --> 02:14:36.640]  But it does the fucking job.
[02:14:36.640 --> 02:14:37.600]  I mean, think about it.
[02:14:37.600 --> 02:14:43.200]  Nature, when this planet was formed, it was just a molten ball of shits floating in space
[02:14:43.200 --> 02:14:44.480]  without an atmosphere.
[02:14:44.480 --> 02:14:48.640]  Well, how did it end up to be this Garden of Eden before we fucked that up, right?
[02:14:49.200 --> 02:14:49.840]  Biology.
[02:14:50.640 --> 02:14:52.560]  It does amazing fucking things.
[02:14:53.760 --> 02:14:58.400]  Some of the shit now, the work that's being done on Archaea coming out of these volcanic
[02:14:58.400 --> 02:15:03.280]  vents down the bottom of the ocean, amazing stuff, amazing stuff.
[02:15:03.280 --> 02:15:06.480]  So in that regard, it's a great time to be alive.
[02:15:07.120 --> 02:15:13.280]  And again, that's why I'm trying to arrest the thermophilic process so that I can powder
[02:15:13.280 --> 02:15:19.520]  coat it, or so I can install biology to start breaking down some of the shit that's coming
[02:15:19.520 --> 02:15:20.080]  in.
[02:15:20.080 --> 02:15:22.800]  Because you know it's got frigging roundup.
[02:15:22.800 --> 02:15:29.680]  It's got a lot of the shit's grown in waste sites or on land that's been polluted by
[02:15:30.240 --> 02:15:31.920]  insecticides and fertilizers.
[02:15:32.560 --> 02:15:35.440]  So yeah, it's important work.
[02:15:35.440 --> 02:15:39.680]  And you're absolutely right that the potential for cross-contamination is huge.
[02:15:40.640 --> 02:15:44.560]  And again, that's why they apply it on fucking fields to kill weeds.
[02:15:48.800 --> 02:15:52.880]  We had a guest yesterday that was talking about he'd been traveling the world, right?
[02:15:53.520 --> 02:15:54.400]  His name is Andrew.
[02:15:54.400 --> 02:15:56.720]  Shout out to Andrew, Terraflora Organics.
[02:15:56.720 --> 02:15:58.720]  And he was talking about roundup, Blayton.
[02:15:58.720 --> 02:16:03.280]  And he was saying that when he was in America, he couldn't figure out what was causing he
[02:16:03.280 --> 02:16:05.440]  has horrible digestive issues.
[02:16:06.160 --> 02:16:09.840]  It was crippling probably to just his normal lifestyle and all these things.
[02:16:10.560 --> 02:16:14.240]  It's hard to even imagine living every day like that.
[02:16:14.240 --> 02:16:17.600]  He said when he would go anywhere, he'd have to always know where the bathroom was and
[02:16:17.600 --> 02:16:18.240]  stuff.
[02:16:18.240 --> 02:16:20.640]  So then he moves, I believe it was to Germany.
[02:16:21.280 --> 02:16:25.200]  Eating things improve, all of a sudden his life is back to normal.
[02:16:25.200 --> 02:16:27.600]  And he's enjoying his lifestyle and that kind of stuff.
[02:16:28.400 --> 02:16:33.920]  Long story short, moves back to America, thinks that all the problems have been fixed.
[02:16:33.920 --> 02:16:39.120]  And within a week, all of those problems that he used to have are back, causing him severe
[02:16:39.120 --> 02:16:41.360]  issues in life and just in general.
[02:16:41.360 --> 02:16:45.520]  He finds out that it's actually from roundup itself, the glossophates and all that kind
[02:16:45.520 --> 02:16:46.240]  of stuff.
[02:16:46.240 --> 02:16:48.480]  So I just wanted to share that with the viewers as well.
[02:16:49.200 --> 02:16:54.400]  I feel like if you're eating poorly grown food, a lot of processed foods and stuff,
[02:16:54.400 --> 02:16:59.680]  and you're wondering why you're having a lot of stomach issues, you should reach out
[02:16:59.680 --> 02:17:04.400]  to Andrew or check out Google and YouTube and kind of go down that rabbit hole.
[02:17:04.960 --> 02:17:10.640]  But it does seem like for a lot of people out there, once they cut that stuff out, their
[02:17:10.640 --> 02:17:12.160]  life just improves dramatically.
[02:17:12.160 --> 02:17:13.680]  And he's growing his own food now.
[02:17:13.680 --> 02:17:18.720]  So I can only imagine the amount of absorption rates that the body is taking as well.
[02:17:19.360 --> 02:17:19.520]  So—
[02:17:19.520 --> 02:17:20.880]  Dr. Pompa You know what?
[02:17:20.880 --> 02:17:25.920]  They've recently come out with five times stronger 5X roundup.
[02:17:26.720 --> 02:17:27.040]  Why?
[02:17:27.680 --> 02:17:27.920]  Right?
[02:17:27.920 --> 02:17:33.040]  If roundup is strong enough to kill fucking everything, why would you make it stronger?
[02:17:33.040 --> 02:17:33.920]  Guess what, guys?
[02:17:33.920 --> 02:17:38.640]  There's bacteria out there that's now breaking that shit down, and it's not working the
[02:17:38.640 --> 02:17:39.440]  same way it was.
[02:17:40.160 --> 02:17:42.400]  So the plants have become more tolerant.
[02:17:42.400 --> 02:17:45.280]  They are growing out specific bacteria to break it down.
[02:17:45.840 --> 02:17:50.000]  So eventually, everything that we've done will break down.
[02:17:51.040 --> 02:17:51.920]  That's the good news.
[02:17:52.800 --> 02:17:55.680]  The bad news is that, yeah, people are going to get fucking sick.
[02:17:56.640 --> 02:18:00.480]  Cancer is going to go through the fucking roof in the next few years.
[02:18:00.480 --> 02:18:07.840]  And the problem is, is our immune system is in our gut.
[02:18:07.840 --> 02:18:13.920]  It's actually in the lower colon where you have biology to the—I forget the factor,
[02:18:13.920 --> 02:18:15.600]  but it's quadrillions.
[02:18:16.240 --> 02:18:17.040]  It's amazing.
[02:18:19.600 --> 02:18:27.440]  So if you're eating shit that doesn't have nutrition and has no vitamins and minerals,
[02:18:28.880 --> 02:18:34.320]  you're not feeding the bacteria or the biology that's helping battle any ailments that you
[02:18:34.320 --> 02:18:35.040]  have.
[02:18:35.040 --> 02:18:36.720]  It's like a triple negative.
[02:18:37.760 --> 02:18:43.360]  So this is one of the reasons why cancer is skyrocketing, and another reason why
[02:18:43.920 --> 02:18:48.960]  we've got to start putting hemp back into our diets, because we need our endocannabinoid
[02:18:48.960 --> 02:18:53.440]  health to be up to speed, as well as our biology.
[02:18:54.160 --> 02:18:56.720]  And this is another really fucking crazy thing.
[02:18:57.520 --> 02:18:59.040]  I think I've told this story before.
[02:19:00.560 --> 02:19:02.960]  My cousin married a chief of staff.
[02:19:02.960 --> 02:19:07.520]  Now, a chief of staff at a major hospital, he is a doctor's doctor.
[02:19:07.520 --> 02:19:13.360]  Doctors go to him to get help or to have diagnostics, because he knows every single doctor's
[02:19:13.360 --> 02:19:15.120]  position and what they're supposed to do.
[02:19:15.920 --> 02:19:17.760]  So he came—we were sitting around.
[02:19:17.760 --> 02:19:18.800]  I was having a scotch.
[02:19:18.800 --> 02:19:19.920]  He was having some wine.
[02:19:20.560 --> 02:19:24.000]  And he goes, Jen told me that you're working with protozoa.
[02:19:24.000 --> 02:19:24.800]  What are you doing?
[02:19:24.800 --> 02:19:30.080]  And I'm like, oh, well, you know, I make these products to help clean up soil and as well
[02:19:30.080 --> 02:19:34.000]  as bring fertility back to dirt so that it becomes soil again.
[02:19:34.720 --> 02:19:36.960]  And he goes, so you've got protozoa?
[02:19:36.960 --> 02:19:38.080]  And I go, yo, yeah, man.
[02:19:38.080 --> 02:19:40.240]  I got a shit ton of flagellates and amoeba.
[02:19:40.240 --> 02:19:41.040]  Why do you ask?
[02:19:41.120 --> 02:19:43.520]  He goes, well, you ever heard of a fecal transplant?
[02:19:43.520 --> 02:19:45.120]  And I'm like, no, what's that?
[02:19:45.120 --> 02:19:49.120]  He goes, when we kill people, when we nuke them with chemo and all this other shit,
[02:19:50.480 --> 02:19:54.800]  their body's ability to actually digest food is gone.
[02:19:55.440 --> 02:19:56.160]  Scary, right?
[02:19:56.960 --> 02:20:03.040]  So what they do is they collect fecal matter from a close relative, sister, brother, someone
[02:20:03.040 --> 02:20:03.760]  in their family.
[02:20:04.480 --> 02:20:10.080]  They remove it from their colon and insert it into the patient's colon to jumpstart
[02:20:10.640 --> 02:20:15.600]  the gut health back to just to get back to digesting food.
[02:20:16.400 --> 02:20:21.600]  Now, think about think about like how fucking crazy that is, right?
[02:20:22.400 --> 02:20:29.200]  And so he's like, he goes, can you make this in like in a in a liquid or a solid form?
[02:20:29.200 --> 02:20:31.040]  I go, yeah, I can make it both.
[02:20:32.000 --> 02:20:34.960]  He goes, oh, my fucking God, you know what?
[02:20:34.960 --> 02:20:40.880]  That would prevent us from having to do fecal transplants, which are don't often work.
[02:20:40.880 --> 02:20:47.360]  And there's a lot of potential cross contaminations and infections that happen in these processes.
[02:20:48.400 --> 02:20:54.960]  So I sent him a report showing, you know, how many millions of flagellates and amoebas
[02:20:54.960 --> 02:20:58.240]  and the different level of fungi and biology in it.
[02:20:58.240 --> 02:20:59.760]  And he was so excited.
[02:20:59.760 --> 02:21:04.800]  He was going to go to the board and explain to him, look, we don't need
[02:21:04.800 --> 02:21:05.840]  to do this anymore.
[02:21:05.840 --> 02:21:10.880]  This guy can you know, I told him I can build a clean room and I can harvest plants out of nature
[02:21:11.440 --> 02:21:14.240]  to target your specific needs.
[02:21:14.240 --> 02:21:20.160]  And then we can make it in a solid form that you can put in erectile and a liquid form
[02:21:20.160 --> 02:21:20.960]  that you can drink.
[02:21:20.960 --> 02:21:24.080]  So now we're hitting both sides of the digestive system.
[02:21:24.880 --> 02:21:26.640]  He was freaking the fuck out.
[02:21:26.640 --> 02:21:30.000]  And so a week later, I call him and say, hey, what's going on?
[02:21:30.000 --> 02:21:31.760]  I thought, you know, you were all hot and heavy on this.
[02:21:32.720 --> 02:21:35.440]  Um, we can't figure out a way to make money on it.
[02:21:35.440 --> 02:21:37.440]  So we're not going to go any further.
[02:21:38.960 --> 02:21:40.240]  Did you fucking hear what I said?
[02:21:40.240 --> 02:21:44.160]  I'm making free fucking compost to help heal people.
[02:21:44.160 --> 02:21:46.400]  And they're like, no, because we can't make money on it.
[02:21:46.400 --> 02:21:47.280]  We're not going to do this.
[02:21:48.160 --> 02:21:49.920]  That's our fucking medical industry.
[02:21:49.920 --> 02:21:53.920]  And worse, they don't even teach fucking nutrition.
[02:21:54.480 --> 02:21:57.200]  They don't teach nutrition in fucking med school.
[02:21:57.840 --> 02:22:00.480]  Nutrition, food is our medicine.
[02:22:00.480 --> 02:22:02.720]  That's the key to the whole fucking thing.
[02:22:03.760 --> 02:22:05.760]  It's you guys, it's fucking insanity.
[02:22:05.760 --> 02:22:07.120]  There's my fucking rant.
[02:22:07.120 --> 02:22:09.520]  I'm so sick of the medical industry right now.
[02:22:09.520 --> 02:22:14.480]  And another thing that nobody fucking seems to know is that the pharmaceutical industries
[02:22:15.120 --> 02:22:20.960]  came in and took over the medical schools and basically said, oh, we can do all these
[02:22:20.960 --> 02:22:22.880]  wonderful things with chemistry.
[02:22:23.920 --> 02:22:25.280]  Don't worry about food.
[02:22:25.280 --> 02:22:26.400]  Don't worry about health.
[02:22:28.320 --> 02:22:29.120]  What the fuck?
[02:22:29.920 --> 02:22:31.360]  Oh, and how they treat cancer.
[02:22:32.720 --> 02:22:34.800]  Fucking radiation and chemo.
[02:22:34.800 --> 02:22:37.600]  That was invented 50 fucking years ago.
[02:22:37.600 --> 02:22:41.040]  They've raised billions of dollars for cancer research.
[02:22:41.040 --> 02:22:42.720]  And what's what's come of it?
[02:22:42.720 --> 02:22:44.160]  Has anything come out of it?
[02:22:47.040 --> 02:22:49.680]  Well, says her, and it's not a rant until your hat falls off.
[02:22:50.160 --> 02:23:08.480]  If you can't tell, I'm exhausted and frustrated with a cancer battle with a loved one.
[02:23:08.480 --> 02:23:09.360]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:23:10.480 --> 02:23:13.520]  It's not looking good, but I'm not going to talk about that today.
[02:23:14.080 --> 02:23:16.480]  Anyway, so let's go.
[02:23:16.480 --> 02:23:17.920]  I could send you some mushroom.
[02:23:17.920 --> 02:23:18.880]  We'll have to talk about it.
[02:23:18.880 --> 02:23:21.680]  I got some mushroom extract, turkey tail and stuff that I.
[02:23:23.120 --> 02:23:25.440]  Yeah, it's too late, dude.
[02:23:25.440 --> 02:23:26.320]  It's fucking too late.
[02:23:27.280 --> 02:23:29.120]  You know, it's just fucking too late.
[02:23:29.120 --> 02:23:32.080]  But anyway, I'm not going to I'm not going to go there now.
[02:23:32.080 --> 02:23:34.080]  So let's let's try to reel it back in.
[02:23:34.720 --> 02:23:42.720]  So the answer is, yes, that biology will do amazing things on very horrible chemicals
[02:23:42.720 --> 02:23:44.000]  and even nuclear waste.
[02:23:44.480 --> 02:23:50.160]  It's been proven that that specifically mycorrhizae fungi will take up isotopes,
[02:23:50.800 --> 02:23:53.200]  bring it back to the plant, the plant will reject it,
[02:23:53.920 --> 02:23:57.840]  and the mycorrhizae will store it in a tube away from the plant.
[02:23:57.840 --> 02:24:01.280]  So, oh, my dog's eating plastic.
[02:24:01.840 --> 02:24:02.160]  Hang on.
[02:24:02.160 --> 02:24:03.120]  Let me get it out of his mouth.
[02:24:06.480 --> 02:24:08.160]  Dude, that's certainly he was talking about.
[02:24:08.160 --> 02:24:10.000]  How the hell do you figure that shit out?
[02:24:10.960 --> 02:24:13.920]  Literally, we got to take fecal matter out of the system.
[02:24:14.560 --> 02:24:15.520]  Brother, sister.
[02:24:16.960 --> 02:24:20.240]  That's just seems so ass backwards to anything kind of.
[02:24:21.440 --> 02:24:26.400]  From what I understand, man, when it was doctors were really focused on the health.
[02:24:26.400 --> 02:24:31.440]  You would pay the doctor when you didn't go see them like the shit was reversed or in
[02:24:31.440 --> 02:24:35.280]  other cultures, I guess it's kind of reversed where it's like when you when you're healthy
[02:24:35.280 --> 02:24:38.560]  all the time, that's when you got to be paying your doctor, right?
[02:24:38.560 --> 02:24:43.680]  That's because he's advised you on nutrition, him or her is advised you on nutrition.
[02:24:43.680 --> 02:24:45.520]  That kind of stuff, keeping you healthy.
[02:24:45.520 --> 02:24:50.240]  So you owe them because you're, you know, you're a healthy individual where it's
[02:24:50.240 --> 02:24:56.080]  basically the ass backwards where here we, especially my parents, I feel like they believe
[02:24:56.080 --> 02:24:58.240]  that the doctor was knew everything.
[02:24:58.240 --> 02:25:02.880]  So when they were pumping me full of Adderall and I would bring up to him like, yo, I whatever
[02:25:02.880 --> 02:25:06.160]  this is doing to my brain long term, it feels super weird.
[02:25:06.160 --> 02:25:11.600]  Like my my entire personality feels dramatically different when I'm taking this pill, you
[02:25:11.600 --> 02:25:14.160]  know, every day for 30 days or on.
[02:25:14.160 --> 02:25:18.160]  And I felt like I was a young I think I was like 15, 14 at the time.
[02:25:18.160 --> 02:25:20.240]  I had 30 milligrams, which was the most.
[02:25:20.880 --> 02:25:25.360]  And that was something that really just I felt like opened my eyes to cannabis because
[02:25:25.360 --> 02:25:26.960]  I was like, there's got to be something else.
[02:25:26.960 --> 02:25:31.600]  And then that's when I really probably dived down the hole of smoking weed and probably
[02:25:31.600 --> 02:25:32.640]  been doing it ever since.
[02:25:33.280 --> 02:25:37.440]  But the pharmaceuticals, there was just something even in me where I was like, man, this is
[02:25:38.000 --> 02:25:43.280]  if the lack of a better understanding is it felt like it was rewiring my brain so you
[02:25:43.280 --> 02:25:45.040]  could use it for like a day or two.
[02:25:45.040 --> 02:25:47.600]  Shit was like Superman stuff, right?
[02:25:47.600 --> 02:25:48.400]  It was amazing.
[02:25:48.400 --> 02:25:52.480]  You'd be like focused in on something or if you were like, especially during college,
[02:25:52.480 --> 02:25:55.520]  if you procrastinated, you needed like a pick me up.
[02:25:55.520 --> 02:25:56.880]  I mean, it's basically speed, right?
[02:25:56.880 --> 02:25:58.000]  That's what it is.
[02:25:59.120 --> 02:26:05.040]  But when you're taking that on a constant basis, I can't imagine, you know, now from
[02:26:05.040 --> 02:26:08.640]  what I understand, my boys are getting into elementary school.
[02:26:09.200 --> 02:26:13.520]  There's some kids that are going to the schools right here in Cherry Creek.
[02:26:13.520 --> 02:26:19.040]  And from what I understand, those kids are on Adderall and I cannot fucking imagine what
[02:26:19.040 --> 02:26:21.760]  that's doing to their little brain, especially at that age.
[02:26:23.680 --> 02:26:24.560]  So there's my rant.
[02:26:28.320 --> 02:26:32.880]  Pharmaceutical companies, like you were saying, whether it's wherever it is, man, it just
[02:26:32.880 --> 02:26:38.320]  seems like the overall health of the individual is the last thing that they worry about.
[02:26:38.320 --> 02:26:42.720]  It's like how long can we keep them on the little piece of-
[02:26:42.720 --> 02:26:43.760]  Keep them sick.
[02:26:43.760 --> 02:26:44.480]  Keep them sick.
[02:26:44.480 --> 02:26:45.360]  They're great clients.
[02:26:46.000 --> 02:26:48.320]  And you know, even more scary shit.
[02:26:48.320 --> 02:26:53.440]  Merck, I was doing a project with Merck because they wanted to be more green.
[02:26:54.400 --> 02:26:58.720]  And so they're not allowed to bring anything in to the facility.
[02:26:58.720 --> 02:27:02.160]  This is a campus and they don't want anything going out.
[02:27:02.160 --> 02:27:03.920]  So they needed help with food waste.
[02:27:04.720 --> 02:27:08.800]  And there was this particular area where nothing was growing.
[02:27:09.360 --> 02:27:13.040]  And so I asked the foreman, I'm like, what's going on over there?
[02:27:13.040 --> 02:27:14.320]  Why is there no grass?
[02:27:14.880 --> 02:27:16.880]  Oh, well, that used to be a building.
[02:27:16.880 --> 02:27:19.040]  And I'm like, well, why did they knock it down?
[02:27:20.880 --> 02:27:22.560]  Too toxic to work in.
[02:27:24.080 --> 02:27:29.760]  And so when they tore it down, you know, obviously a lot of shit had leached underneath that building.
[02:27:30.480 --> 02:27:33.200]  And they basically couldn't do anything.
[02:27:33.200 --> 02:27:34.160]  They couldn't build on it.
[02:27:34.160 --> 02:27:36.720]  They couldn't- anything that they tried to plant died.
[02:27:38.240 --> 02:27:41.920]  And I was like, you know, that's a fucking problem, dude.
[02:27:41.920 --> 02:27:45.440]  I mean, every time it rains, you're just pushing that shit down into the groundwater.
[02:27:46.160 --> 02:27:49.440]  Why don't we fucking make compost and start cleaning that shit up?
[02:27:49.440 --> 02:27:51.440]  Oh, we're not allowed to bring anything on site.
[02:27:52.320 --> 02:27:56.240]  I'm like, what kind of fucking ass backwards is this?
[02:27:56.240 --> 02:28:01.920]  I mean, you're polluting- you're continuously polluting the groundwater instead of fucking
[02:28:01.920 --> 02:28:02.480]  dealing with it.
[02:28:03.040 --> 02:28:11.440]  And this is the pharmaceutical industry who's making billions of dollars off us, off our
[02:28:11.440 --> 02:28:11.760]  health.
[02:28:12.720 --> 02:28:13.840]  All right, where's our government?
[02:28:14.880 --> 02:28:16.720]  Where's fucking- where's anybody?
[02:28:17.360 --> 02:28:20.480]  You know, why is nothing being said or done about this shit?
[02:28:21.040 --> 02:28:22.240]  Sorry, rant three today.
[02:28:23.600 --> 02:28:24.800]  Just fucking pissed off.
[02:28:25.120 --> 02:28:26.880]  Is that rant one or two?
[02:28:26.880 --> 02:28:28.560]  I don't know.
[02:28:28.560 --> 02:28:29.060]  That was a rant.
[02:28:30.320 --> 02:28:36.240]  You know, that reminds me of some- a good side story here.
[02:28:36.960 --> 02:28:41.840]  You know, I used to work in engineering, you know, doing hydrogen fuel cells.
[02:28:41.840 --> 02:28:45.360]  And, you know, it's similar when you think about like the fracking companies and things
[02:28:45.360 --> 02:28:45.920]  like that.
[02:28:45.920 --> 02:28:51.040]  You know, I try not to be, you know, too extremely negative about them.
[02:28:51.040 --> 02:28:55.360]  But at the same time, they are- they were doing a lot of funding for the work.
[02:28:56.480 --> 02:29:00.400]  And, you know, there was an alternative energy.
[02:29:00.960 --> 02:29:05.600]  And a really funny thing that this guy told me while I was working there, he was a mining
[02:29:05.600 --> 02:29:06.320]  engineer.
[02:29:06.320 --> 02:29:10.480]  Now, that's why he was working with the minerals that were being printed onto these layers
[02:29:10.480 --> 02:29:11.600]  for these fuel cells.
[02:29:12.800 --> 02:29:16.720]  And I'm sitting there and one day and I'm like kind of feeling like, man, I'm tired
[02:29:16.720 --> 02:29:18.400]  of this, like working in natural gas.
[02:29:18.400 --> 02:29:22.800]  And he's like, well, you can always go work for like a wind company, you know?
[02:29:22.800 --> 02:29:23.840]  And I was like, really?
[02:29:23.840 --> 02:29:26.320]  And he was like, yeah, but I'll tell you a secret.
[02:29:26.320 --> 02:29:36.480]  He's like, all the energy that it takes to build a giant windmill is- and the amount
[02:29:36.480 --> 02:29:42.800]  of energy that it'll create is less than it is to actually make that windmill.
[02:29:43.360 --> 02:29:48.320]  So even if it has a perfect lifespan, that windmill will never make as much energy.
[02:29:48.800 --> 02:29:53.440]  It will never produce as much energy as it was put into the forging of the material and
[02:29:53.440 --> 02:29:54.960]  the mining of the materials.
[02:29:55.920 --> 02:29:59.040]  So I think that we really got to be conscious, you know, about where-
[02:29:59.040 --> 02:30:00.880]  I feel like a lot of people are getting called out on that.
[02:30:00.880 --> 02:30:02.800]  I appreciate you saying that part.
[02:30:02.800 --> 02:30:06.480]  Yeah, because there's even been like clothing brands and stuff that were saying that they
[02:30:06.480 --> 02:30:07.680]  didn't use oil.
[02:30:07.680 --> 02:30:13.200]  I think the most famous one so far, a clothing brand was the Pantagonia, was claiming that
[02:30:13.200 --> 02:30:15.440]  they didn't use oil to produce anything.
[02:30:15.440 --> 02:30:16.960]  And that's just not true, man.
[02:30:16.960 --> 02:30:21.280]  I'm glad that you talked about wind power because it does seem like a farce.
[02:30:21.280 --> 02:30:25.520]  The more that you do research it, and it's like the amount of oil and stuff it took to
[02:30:25.520 --> 02:30:26.960]  create those kind of things.
[02:30:26.960 --> 02:30:31.280]  Obviously, there's very few plants that can make a giant windmill like that.
[02:30:32.000 --> 02:30:37.040]  I drive through the Midwest, you know, doing even these reptile shows and stuff.
[02:30:37.040 --> 02:30:38.880]  So driving through Kansas, you see a lot of them.
[02:30:39.600 --> 02:30:42.800]  It doesn't seem like they're very active.
[02:30:43.440 --> 02:30:49.920]  If there's a sea of these windmills, maybe 10, 20% of them seem like they're actually
[02:30:49.920 --> 02:30:51.440]  moving where the rest are just sitting there.
[02:30:51.440 --> 02:30:55.200]  I know that changes with the current and stuff like that, but I've personally never seen
[02:30:55.200 --> 02:30:58.720]  just the whole field of these things moving at once.
[02:31:00.560 --> 02:31:04.800]  I like that, man, because most people are kind of like, they just agree with that.
[02:31:04.800 --> 02:31:06.880]  Like, oh, yeah, wind energy is so important.
[02:31:06.960 --> 02:31:15.920]  And if you really break it down, it seems like they fooled humanity on that.
[02:31:15.920 --> 02:31:19.920]  Like the amount of everything that it takes to build that, like you had mentioned, it's
[02:31:19.920 --> 02:31:21.280]  just not sustainable.
[02:31:22.080 --> 02:31:23.520]  It's greenwashing, guys.
[02:31:23.520 --> 02:31:25.040]  I mean, there's another one.
[02:31:25.840 --> 02:31:27.760]  Electric cars, right?
[02:31:27.760 --> 02:31:28.320]  The battery.
[02:31:28.800 --> 02:31:37.760]  Do you know how fucking nasty that battery is and how much energy went into making that
[02:31:37.760 --> 02:31:38.240]  battery?
[02:31:39.440 --> 02:31:42.560]  And then what are you going to do with it when it's no good anymore?
[02:31:43.520 --> 02:31:48.080]  You just basically fucked up shit way worse than it was if you just use the fucking gas.
[02:31:48.880 --> 02:31:52.240]  You know, it's and I fucking love these.
[02:31:52.960 --> 02:31:58.480]  These trucks running on natural gas and they say, oh, we're we're renewable gas,
[02:31:59.360 --> 02:32:00.640]  renewable, renewable.
[02:32:03.600 --> 02:32:05.600]  You know, it's always greenwashing.
[02:32:05.600 --> 02:32:08.080]  It's just it's it's fucking scary.
[02:32:08.080 --> 02:32:09.680]  And it's all money, you guys.
[02:32:09.680 --> 02:32:11.840]  This is all big, huge money.
[02:32:12.400 --> 02:32:17.120]  It's the same fucking crew that's got the oil wells that are fucking building these
[02:32:17.120 --> 02:32:22.160]  windmills because they're just they know they're going to fucking run out of fuel at some point.
[02:32:22.160 --> 02:32:25.040]  And so they want to just greenwash the fuck out of us.
[02:32:25.040 --> 02:32:25.920]  And that's what they do.
[02:32:26.880 --> 02:32:32.560]  It's you know, it's it's time that humanity say, hey, wait a minute, you motherfuckers
[02:32:32.560 --> 02:32:34.400]  push us into extinction.
[02:32:34.400 --> 02:32:39.280]  And, you know, this this was one of the reasons why I was so passionate about cannabis plant,
[02:32:39.280 --> 02:32:46.640]  because it seems like it's the one thing on this planet that's empowering people to have
[02:32:46.640 --> 02:32:50.720]  conversation about regenerative organics and grow.
[02:32:51.280 --> 02:32:56.240]  And and that's that's where it has to start, because, you know, in my mind, most people
[02:32:56.240 --> 02:33:00.320]  are fucking so brainwashed at this point that they don't even understand.
[02:33:01.440 --> 02:33:07.840]  Well, if the cow's eating grass that's grown with Roundup and I eat the cow, is it going
[02:33:07.840 --> 02:33:08.880]  to affect me?
[02:33:08.880 --> 02:33:09.440]  Hell yeah.
[02:33:10.000 --> 02:33:11.680]  But people don't think about that.
[02:33:11.680 --> 02:33:16.800]  They think that the hamburger is just something that came from something, right?
[02:33:17.040 --> 02:33:17.540]  It.
[02:33:21.080 --> 02:33:21.640]  That's all.
[02:33:22.360 --> 02:33:22.920]  Yeah.
[02:33:22.920 --> 02:33:23.160]  Yeah.
[02:33:23.960 --> 02:33:24.440]  Hold on.
[02:33:24.440 --> 02:33:25.720]  I'm about to put on another hat.
[02:33:25.720 --> 02:33:26.600]  You ready?
[02:33:26.600 --> 02:33:26.920]  Yep.
[02:33:28.200 --> 02:33:32.360]  That's it for a reporter.
[02:33:32.360 --> 02:33:33.880]  Ask Elon Musk, please.
[02:33:33.880 --> 02:33:36.840]  That's what I love.
[02:33:36.840 --> 02:33:37.340]  It.
[02:33:37.960 --> 02:33:39.320]  Even those cosmic rays.
[02:33:40.280 --> 02:33:45.800]  A reporter asked Elon Musk if his plant, because they were touting how like energy saving or
[02:33:46.200 --> 02:33:48.840]  was plugged into the actual grid system itself.
[02:33:48.840 --> 02:33:52.840]  Like the I think there's like three or four major grid systems in America.
[02:33:54.120 --> 02:33:55.800]  And he had he had to say yes.
[02:33:57.400 --> 02:34:01.640]  So that was when we're getting back to the energy, I just thought that was pretty eye
[02:34:01.640 --> 02:34:07.960]  opening, like the Apple, the major Apple headquarters that's still plugged into the grid,
[02:34:07.960 --> 02:34:11.320]  even though I feel like all their marketing stuff made it seem like it wasn't.
[02:34:11.880 --> 02:34:12.380]  So.
[02:34:13.720 --> 02:34:19.400]  I don't know from what I understand, too, about fossil fuels and stuff like that, it's
[02:34:19.400 --> 02:34:21.000]  almost like diamonds, if you will.
[02:34:21.640 --> 02:34:23.480]  There's a there's a lot down there.
[02:34:23.480 --> 02:34:24.920]  They just act like there's not.
[02:34:25.800 --> 02:34:28.360]  Well, that's how they inflate prices and increase profits.
[02:34:29.400 --> 02:34:29.720]  Right.
[02:34:29.720 --> 02:34:32.440]  Every time, every time you turn around, they predict a hurricane.
[02:34:32.440 --> 02:34:36.760]  The price goes through the roof, even though the supply line is already full.
[02:34:36.760 --> 02:34:38.440]  It's not going to affect the supply line.
[02:34:39.000 --> 02:34:40.120]  It's just money gouging.
[02:34:40.120 --> 02:34:43.080]  And, you know, let's go back to the electric car, right?
[02:34:44.600 --> 02:34:47.080]  Somewhere you have to plug that fucking thing in.
[02:34:47.800 --> 02:34:52.840]  And so where is that energy, those those electrons coming from?
[02:34:53.400 --> 02:34:54.920]  Oh, power production plant.
[02:34:54.920 --> 02:34:58.360]  OK, so is it a nuclear power plant?
[02:34:58.360 --> 02:35:00.360]  Is a coal fired power plant?
[02:35:00.360 --> 02:35:02.280]  Is a natural gas fire plant?
[02:35:02.280 --> 02:35:03.000]  What is it?
[02:35:03.000 --> 02:35:03.880]  Where's it coming from?
[02:35:04.440 --> 02:35:09.000]  And the craziest thing about all of these renewable energy sources is that.
[02:35:10.360 --> 02:35:19.000]  The grid companies, the distributors is what they're called, are required to make sure
[02:35:19.000 --> 02:35:28.040]  that there's enough energy on demand at any one time that if there was a spike, they wouldn't
[02:35:28.040 --> 02:35:29.160]  they wouldn't lose service.
[02:35:29.720 --> 02:35:37.800]  So the vast majority of these windmills and solar power, solar collectors is basically
[02:35:37.800 --> 02:35:41.320]  dumped into the ground because they have an abundance.
[02:35:41.320 --> 02:35:45.640]  They're already had to make this much in anticipation of that demand.
[02:35:46.200 --> 02:35:49.720]  So anything that came off the roof, well, they didn't need it because they already
[02:35:49.720 --> 02:35:50.760]  had made the other shit.
[02:35:51.320 --> 02:35:53.560]  You know, I can't store it from what I understand.
[02:35:53.560 --> 02:35:54.680]  Or it did.
[02:35:54.680 --> 02:35:57.480]  And, you know, they've talked about using salt batteries.
[02:35:57.480 --> 02:36:03.480]  And, you know, there is some really cool tech technology that came out of Aquion.
[02:36:03.480 --> 02:36:06.600]  And there was another one in Massachusetts.
[02:36:07.560 --> 02:36:10.120]  And they're basically like little file cabins.
[02:36:10.920 --> 02:36:16.920]  And the thought was that if you had a solar panel during the day, it would charge this
[02:36:16.920 --> 02:36:18.280]  little filing cabinet.
[02:36:19.160 --> 02:36:24.760]  And what happens inside there, it was made with two non-toxic metals and salt, just a
[02:36:24.760 --> 02:36:25.400]  pile of salt.
[02:36:25.960 --> 02:36:32.760]  And these metals heat up when the solar when the electrons come down and they liquefy the
[02:36:32.760 --> 02:36:38.200]  salt and then the salt can slowly cool down and release back either heat or electricity.
[02:36:38.920 --> 02:36:42.920]  Well, somebody bought that company up and shelved it.
[02:36:44.440 --> 02:36:49.240]  You know, just another prime example of like the carburetor that run 220 fucking miles
[02:36:49.240 --> 02:36:49.960]  on a gallon.
[02:36:49.960 --> 02:36:50.920]  You know how they did that?
[02:36:51.480 --> 02:36:57.800]  All they did was take the gasoline, put a tube inside the exhaust and run that to back
[02:36:57.800 --> 02:36:58.760]  up to the carburetor.
[02:36:58.760 --> 02:37:05.320]  So that when the gasoline went through the exhaust pipe, it vaporized and burned fucking
[02:37:05.320 --> 02:37:06.120]  clean as a whistle.
[02:37:07.560 --> 02:37:08.760]  That got taken away from us.
[02:37:09.400 --> 02:37:10.840]  You know, all of these things.
[02:37:10.840 --> 02:37:12.360]  And again, it's money and greed.
[02:37:12.360 --> 02:37:17.800]  It's way off the topic of cannabis, but it's just it's the reality of where we live.
[02:37:17.800 --> 02:37:23.480]  Our politicians have sold us out and they don't fucking care because they're just too
[02:37:23.480 --> 02:37:25.320]  busy stealing money to fucking give a shit.
[02:37:26.280 --> 02:37:27.720]  I mean, it's fucking sad, man.
[02:37:27.720 --> 02:37:28.520]  It's really sad.
[02:37:28.520 --> 02:37:34.440]  But at least there's us cannabis growers, regenerative farmers who are really pushing
[02:37:34.440 --> 02:37:39.160]  and making a difference and trying to get this shit cleaned up and trying to make a
[02:37:39.160 --> 02:37:39.560]  difference.
[02:37:40.120 --> 02:37:48.360]  You know, I see the future of all waste sites is perhaps just a field of hemp, you know,
[02:37:48.360 --> 02:37:49.960]  that helps them accumulate.
[02:37:49.960 --> 02:37:50.200]  Right.
[02:37:51.800 --> 02:37:55.480]  Problem is, once you've accumulated it, now what do you do with it?
[02:37:55.480 --> 02:37:56.920]  Well, you got to break it down again.
[02:37:56.920 --> 02:38:01.880]  So take that compost or take that hemp and compost it and break it down again and just
[02:38:01.880 --> 02:38:04.120]  repeat and repeat until these sites are clean.
[02:38:05.160 --> 02:38:07.320]  But you have yet to get one of these jobs.
[02:38:09.480 --> 02:38:13.960]  But I'm hopeful in the future that I do and I'm going to give the technology away.
[02:38:13.960 --> 02:38:16.680]  It's not it's not about me making fucking money.
[02:38:16.680 --> 02:38:19.160]  That's what caused all these fucking problems.
[02:38:19.160 --> 02:38:26.200]  It was because of money making, not not because we were trying to evolve as a species.
[02:38:27.000 --> 02:38:32.760]  And, you know, that's that's the six sad truth that, you know, it we've repeated this
[02:38:32.760 --> 02:38:37.960]  fucking mistake ever since we've been on the planet, whether that's five million years,
[02:38:37.960 --> 02:38:39.000]  10 million years.
[02:38:39.000 --> 02:38:44.600]  You know, the latest studies are saying somewhere between three and five million years, the
[02:38:44.600 --> 02:38:46.200]  first hominids came around.
[02:38:46.200 --> 02:38:52.360]  But basically, all we've been doing is warring and, you know, de-evolving since since we
[02:38:52.360 --> 02:38:53.000]  got here.
[02:38:53.000 --> 02:38:56.040]  So we are literally the virus on the planet Earth.
[02:38:56.040 --> 02:38:58.440]  But don't worry, it's got billions of years left.
[02:38:58.440 --> 02:38:59.080]  It'll be fine.
[02:39:00.920 --> 02:39:07.640]  Hey, did you see there's a article corroborated by a lot of international agencies and stuff
[02:39:07.640 --> 02:39:13.880]  that at some point there was a nuclear bomb that was going to go off and a UFO came and
[02:39:13.880 --> 02:39:14.760]  dismantled it.
[02:39:15.800 --> 02:39:16.920]  No, I haven't seen that one.
[02:39:16.920 --> 02:39:17.480]  Hold on.
[02:39:17.480 --> 02:39:18.440]  Hold on a second.
[02:39:20.440 --> 02:39:22.040]  Are we fucking going there?
[02:39:23.480 --> 02:39:25.720]  There's a lot of people that are saying that's true, man.
[02:39:26.040 --> 02:39:29.480]  You know, I can I can talk about aliens if you want to talk about some aliens.
[02:39:30.040 --> 02:39:33.800]  Well, I think the government kind of sneaked it on everybody over the summer.
[02:39:33.800 --> 02:39:35.400]  They just were like, yo, listen to this.
[02:39:35.400 --> 02:39:37.160]  Hey, and by the way, aliens are real.
[02:39:37.160 --> 02:39:38.760]  Right on to tomorrow.
[02:39:38.760 --> 02:39:40.440]  Like that was kind of how that thing went.
[02:39:40.440 --> 02:39:45.160]  But they the government basically came out and said, hey, aliens are real over the summer.
[02:39:45.160 --> 02:39:47.400]  And then everybody kind of forgot about it a week or two later.
[02:39:48.600 --> 02:39:48.840]  Yeah.
[02:39:48.840 --> 02:39:54.040]  And two years ago, Canadian government pretty much came out and talked and did the same
[02:39:54.040 --> 02:39:56.520]  thing that our military did in some ways.
[02:39:56.520 --> 02:39:57.480]  And they talked about it.
[02:39:57.480 --> 02:40:02.040]  And basically, one of the people who head up the government there was talking about
[02:40:02.040 --> 02:40:02.520]  it.
[02:40:02.520 --> 02:40:07.240]  And I think that this is all coming to a head and it all it all does wrap together in some
[02:40:07.240 --> 02:40:08.040]  ways.
[02:40:08.040 --> 02:40:10.280]  You know, I feel like a lot of this stuff is happening.
[02:40:10.280 --> 02:40:14.200]  I mean, you look at the Pentagon, the Pentagon just released last year a big thing saying,
[02:40:14.200 --> 02:40:18.280]  hey, basically, we had a whole team that was watching UFOs.
[02:40:18.280 --> 02:40:19.560]  And then there was a guy like this.
[02:40:20.600 --> 02:40:22.280]  And he was like sitting there like that.
[02:40:22.280 --> 02:40:25.480]  And he was like, that's the head of our little team.
[02:40:25.480 --> 02:40:29.080]  And everyone's like, who is this team looking at these UFOs?
[02:40:29.800 --> 02:40:37.880]  And I don't know about you guys, but I have seen some UFOs with my own eyes.
[02:40:37.880 --> 02:40:39.320]  I don't care what anyone says.
[02:40:39.320 --> 02:40:43.080]  And I feel like it's up to us to kind of spread that knowledge.
[02:40:43.080 --> 02:40:43.960]  It can.
[02:40:43.960 --> 02:40:49.240]  There is some stuff out there that we don't understand, especially on this Halloween episode.
[02:40:49.960 --> 02:40:53.800]  Well, look at all look at all the look at all the pictures that were sent when those
[02:40:53.800 --> 02:40:58.280]  triangles flew over fucking Tempe, Arizona.
[02:40:59.800 --> 02:41:05.560]  You know, I mean, and then the Navy released pictures of a couple objects that they photograph
[02:41:05.560 --> 02:41:06.760]  for periods of time.
[02:41:06.760 --> 02:41:08.200]  So it would be full.
[02:41:08.200 --> 02:41:08.760]  I feel like.
[02:41:08.760 --> 02:41:09.880]  But those are always people.
[02:41:09.880 --> 02:41:13.400]  Now the government's actually coming out and saying like, OK, here are some photos that
[02:41:13.400 --> 02:41:14.040]  we're talking about.
[02:41:14.040 --> 02:41:14.360]  All right.
[02:41:14.360 --> 02:41:15.400]  These three are real.
[02:41:15.400 --> 02:41:16.680]  These two are bullshit.
[02:41:17.640 --> 02:41:23.560]  You know, it's just amazing how then people say, well, the government wouldn't lie to
[02:41:23.560 --> 02:41:24.360]  you about this.
[02:41:24.360 --> 02:41:26.040]  They wouldn't lie to you about this part.
[02:41:26.040 --> 02:41:29.560]  It's like, well, aliens have been real for a long time.
[02:41:29.560 --> 02:41:31.400]  They just came clean with that.
[02:41:31.400 --> 02:41:32.440]  Yeah, we'd be fools.
[02:41:32.440 --> 02:41:35.480]  I mean, who the fuck do you think you are?
[02:41:35.480 --> 02:41:36.280]  All right.
[02:41:36.280 --> 02:41:37.560]  This I love this.
[02:41:37.560 --> 02:41:43.560]  There's a group of how high we've gotten, or at least that we were talking about aliens
[02:41:43.560 --> 02:41:44.680]  on a cannabis show.
[02:41:45.560 --> 02:41:46.360]  So listen to this.
[02:41:46.360 --> 02:41:53.320]  There's a group of monks that give their children stick with a string and a ball.
[02:41:53.320 --> 02:41:57.240]  And the child's job is to sit there and spin that all day long.
[02:41:57.880 --> 02:42:04.680]  And what what the thought is, is that it's explaining to the child that you're on that
[02:42:04.680 --> 02:42:08.520]  little ball floating in space and you're circling the sun.
[02:42:09.080 --> 02:42:09.800]  How big are you?
[02:42:09.800 --> 02:42:10.760]  How important are you?
[02:42:10.760 --> 02:42:12.520]  Do you really fucking matter at all?
[02:42:13.160 --> 02:42:13.880]  Right now?
[02:42:13.880 --> 02:42:15.080]  You don't fucking matter shit.
[02:42:15.960 --> 02:42:22.600]  And so for us to think that we're the only life form and you look up at the fucking galaxy
[02:42:22.600 --> 02:42:27.880]  and you see billions of fucking stars and every one of those little lights has fucking
[02:42:27.880 --> 02:42:29.640]  planets are swinging around it.
[02:42:30.520 --> 02:42:31.000]  Right.
[02:42:31.000 --> 02:42:32.200]  How fucking arrogant are we?
[02:42:38.600 --> 02:42:39.320]  Thanks, Peter.
[02:42:39.480 --> 02:42:47.240]  But yeah, I mean, it's like space like this.
[02:42:49.800 --> 02:42:50.840]  Let's go.
[02:42:50.840 --> 02:42:51.800]  It's Halloween.
[02:43:00.840 --> 02:43:02.200]  Oh, what are you talking about now?
[02:43:02.760 --> 02:43:05.400]  But I mean, if you want to get philosophical for a second.
[02:43:06.120 --> 02:43:14.440]  And then if this is like the intro to the book, it'd be like, it'd be like, you know,
[02:43:14.440 --> 02:43:15.000]  why?
[02:43:15.000 --> 02:43:16.280]  Why are they here?
[02:43:16.280 --> 02:43:19.560]  Because I mean, for me, it's interesting that it seems like there's this divide.
[02:43:20.440 --> 02:43:21.480]  I know we're getting off topic.
[02:43:21.480 --> 02:43:23.960]  Like, it seems like there's this divide like that.
[02:43:23.960 --> 02:43:29.800]  There's we're not supposed to be connected to them yet to the galactic family, I'd like
[02:43:29.800 --> 02:43:30.360]  to call it.
[02:43:31.400 --> 02:43:32.440]  But why?
[02:43:32.520 --> 02:43:33.560]  But why?
[02:43:33.560 --> 02:43:35.320]  That's the interesting part to me.
[02:43:35.320 --> 02:43:36.680]  And who are these beings?
[02:43:36.680 --> 02:43:37.880]  Are they from far away?
[02:43:37.880 --> 02:43:39.400]  Are they interdimensional?
[02:43:39.400 --> 02:43:40.840]  And are they us from the future?
[02:43:41.640 --> 02:43:44.040]  These are some of the things I ask myself when I get to that.
[02:43:45.640 --> 02:43:50.680]  Well, the part, I guess, would start this whole little rabbit hole is, OK, so if aliens
[02:43:50.680 --> 02:43:54.600]  exist, right, we're all learning this shit together as a collective, then they are in
[02:43:54.600 --> 02:43:56.600]  a way managing Earth.
[02:43:56.600 --> 02:44:00.840]  And now the government is and I encourage you guys to read that there's even this news
[02:44:00.840 --> 02:44:03.240]  outlet, I believe is one WION.
[02:44:04.200 --> 02:44:08.120]  But there's a lot of other outlets that I feel like report on stuff that governments
[02:44:08.120 --> 02:44:12.120]  come out with that a lot of the mainstream stuff never talk about.
[02:44:12.120 --> 02:44:14.600]  And it's these goofy little stories like we're talking today.
[02:44:14.600 --> 02:44:16.920]  But I feel like that's a dramatic story.
[02:44:16.920 --> 02:44:22.120]  If a country was going, supposedly Russia was going to nuke us and it got shut down,
[02:44:22.120 --> 02:44:25.480]  supposedly that's happened where we were going to do it and it got shut down.
[02:44:25.480 --> 02:44:29.720]  So if there's even like if one of those is even true.
[02:44:29.720 --> 02:44:36.200]  I mean, it's just unbelievable that they humanity hasn't known about this or we've
[02:44:36.200 --> 02:44:40.840]  been asleep at the wheel with that kind of stuff and really going down the rabbit hole,
[02:44:40.840 --> 02:44:45.080]  I guess, is the Library of Alexandria.
[02:44:45.080 --> 02:44:50.920]  Supposedly there was really creepy DMT type information there.
[02:44:50.920 --> 02:44:52.760]  If that's true, you know, who knows?
[02:44:52.760 --> 02:44:58.120]  But supposedly maybe you guys could talk about more of this than I even know about.
[02:44:58.120 --> 02:45:04.600]  But when we lost when that was lost, it's like humanity lost a lot of not only like
[02:45:04.600 --> 02:45:09.320]  education, but just the understanding of like our purpose and where we are and all this
[02:45:09.320 --> 02:45:10.920]  kind of stuff to really get off topic.
[02:45:11.560 --> 02:45:15.160]  And the fact that we're just sitting here in a little ball and who the hell knows really
[02:45:15.160 --> 02:45:15.720]  where we are.
[02:45:17.800 --> 02:45:20.200]  Well, if you think about it right.
[02:45:21.080 --> 02:45:26.600]  I think in many ways they don't want to get involved with us because we are an experiment
[02:45:26.600 --> 02:45:30.280]  where they're or they've been warned that we're a virus.
[02:45:30.280 --> 02:45:34.520]  And if you show up, we're going to shoot you or throw fucking missiles at you.
[02:45:36.040 --> 02:45:41.800]  So I just don't think humanity as a whole is ready to deal with, you know, thinking
[02:45:41.800 --> 02:45:45.960]  outside of the box, outside of the fact that we are we are not alone.
[02:45:46.360 --> 02:45:54.760]  There are people or beings that are way more powerful than we are and probably will ever
[02:45:54.760 --> 02:45:55.260]  be.
[02:45:55.800 --> 02:46:01.480]  In many, many ways, I laughed at that our galaxy is surrounded by little signs saying
[02:46:01.480 --> 02:46:02.920]  do not go here.
[02:46:02.920 --> 02:46:04.200]  This has been quarantined.
[02:46:08.120 --> 02:46:10.440]  But some still want to check it out, right?
[02:46:10.440 --> 02:46:11.240]  It's quarantine.
[02:46:11.240 --> 02:46:13.000]  There's something cool going on there.
[02:46:13.640 --> 02:46:15.880]  So once in a while, they'll stop by and check it out.
[02:46:15.880 --> 02:46:17.480]  But, you know, I don't know.
[02:46:17.480 --> 02:46:21.800]  I I just think that, you know, again, that we'd be really, really arrogant.
[02:46:21.800 --> 02:46:25.320]  I think that there was an other life on other planets.
[02:46:25.320 --> 02:46:29.240]  And I would I would challenge people that do feel that way to hate.
[02:46:29.240 --> 02:46:29.800]  Totally.
[02:46:29.800 --> 02:46:30.440]  I get it.
[02:46:30.440 --> 02:46:36.360]  But listen to a guy named Bob Lazar and just listen to what he's saying and judge for
[02:46:36.360 --> 02:46:36.920]  yourself.
[02:46:36.920 --> 02:46:39.800]  You know, if you listen to that gentleman talking, you still don't think that what he's
[02:46:39.800 --> 02:46:41.000]  saying is really important.
[02:46:41.000 --> 02:46:44.920]  And you still don't think that what he's saying is real, you know, OK.
[02:46:44.920 --> 02:46:48.760]  But all of his stuff has been corroborated as well.
[02:46:48.760 --> 02:46:53.880]  You know, so there's just to me, maybe it's the coming up on Halloween, but it's just
[02:46:53.880 --> 02:46:57.480]  been kind of creepy to me that seems like life is really speeding up.
[02:46:57.480 --> 02:46:58.840]  Some things are changing.
[02:46:58.840 --> 02:47:03.320]  And then they reveal these little things that should be mind blowing.
[02:47:03.320 --> 02:47:05.800]  I feel like a society, but everything's going too fast.
[02:47:05.800 --> 02:47:07.560]  We're like, wait, aliens are real.
[02:47:07.560 --> 02:47:08.060]  OK.
[02:47:08.380 --> 02:47:11.420]  I felt like that's that was my two cents on it.
[02:47:11.420 --> 02:47:18.940]  They we were revealed that kind of information and then life was just too quick to even really
[02:47:18.940 --> 02:47:19.980]  have a conversation on it.
[02:47:19.980 --> 02:47:23.260]  So I would imagine our audience is probably like, what the fuck?
[02:47:23.260 --> 02:47:24.380]  Get back to growing.
[02:47:24.380 --> 02:47:28.860]  I appreciate that we were able to talk about this kind of stuff because I sit here and
[02:47:28.860 --> 02:47:32.700]  you know, I can our family and friends, we can have these kind of conversations and it's
[02:47:32.700 --> 02:47:36.220]  great sometimes even on mushrooms where it feels like, hey, you know, let's talk kind
[02:47:36.220 --> 02:47:36.940]  of crazy stuff.
[02:47:37.020 --> 02:47:42.860]  But discussion, I feel like in life is the one thing that that I miss and having different
[02:47:42.860 --> 02:47:44.540]  opinions and listening to somebody.
[02:47:44.540 --> 02:47:48.700]  And I feel like sometimes maybe that's where this show does go with some of this stuff
[02:47:48.700 --> 02:47:53.340]  because we, you know, we kind of have this space where we can discuss these kind of things
[02:47:53.340 --> 02:47:57.660]  without, you know, as long as you're coming with facts, that's all I really care about.
[02:47:57.660 --> 02:48:01.260]  You know, it's just let's let's talk about what's real out there.
[02:48:01.260 --> 02:48:04.700]  And again, I appreciate that we were able to talk about it.
[02:48:04.780 --> 02:48:07.100]  That shit is real and that no one really talks about it.
[02:48:07.100 --> 02:48:12.460]  We just kind of, you know, well, you know, let's let's talk about technological advances.
[02:48:12.460 --> 02:48:12.940]  Right.
[02:48:13.820 --> 02:48:20.460]  We made some pretty big fucking leaps in the last 50 years, right around the time Roswell
[02:48:20.460 --> 02:48:24.700]  happened or didn't happen, according to whoever you want to talk to.
[02:48:26.700 --> 02:48:29.900]  So, I mean, where did where did those advances come from?
[02:48:29.900 --> 02:48:32.220]  Where did these new alloys come from?
[02:48:32.300 --> 02:48:35.980]  Where did, you know, ones and zeros and computers come from?
[02:48:35.980 --> 02:48:42.940]  I mean, they I remember as a kid, a calculator was this fucking huge thing and was like three
[02:48:42.940 --> 02:48:43.500]  hundred dollars.
[02:48:44.220 --> 02:48:50.460]  And then within what, two years, three years, it was down to just little tiny things that
[02:48:50.460 --> 02:48:51.020]  were.
[02:48:51.020 --> 02:48:55.500]  I remember the Texas Instrument Calculator, the TI-85 or whatever.
[02:48:55.500 --> 02:48:59.020]  You had to have that bitch to do the graph, the graphing and stuff.
[02:48:59.180 --> 02:48:59.740]  Right.
[02:48:59.740 --> 02:49:05.340]  So, again, where did these advances come from so quickly?
[02:49:05.340 --> 02:49:16.460]  And prior to prior to 19, gosh, probably 50, you know, it was you can almost see how we
[02:49:16.460 --> 02:49:22.060]  we evolved, but very, very slowly, you know, and we can blame it on the wars.
[02:49:22.060 --> 02:49:24.460]  But I mean, look at World War One.
[02:49:24.940 --> 02:49:28.700]  By the end of World War Two, man, we we had fucking nuclear bombs.
[02:49:28.700 --> 02:49:30.140]  Where the fuck did those come from?
[02:49:30.140 --> 02:49:33.980]  Where how do we how do we start making the first heavy water?
[02:49:33.980 --> 02:49:36.940]  So you guys know what heavy water is as an extra hydrogen.
[02:49:38.060 --> 02:49:41.260]  So, you know, those kinds of advances happen really quickly.
[02:49:42.380 --> 02:49:49.740]  Post, you know, I don't know, maybe 1940, you know, the end of the war.
[02:49:50.060 --> 02:49:57.420]  You know, I don't know, maybe 1940, 1950, when all of a sudden shit just got crazy.
[02:49:58.060 --> 02:49:59.820]  And look where we are now.
[02:49:59.820 --> 02:50:01.580]  I mean, I grew up growing up as a kid.
[02:50:02.140 --> 02:50:07.580]  We had a we had a fucking phone that you picked up and you talk to the fucking operator and
[02:50:07.580 --> 02:50:08.940]  you told them where you were going.
[02:50:10.460 --> 02:50:13.580]  Now I can fucking land the Mars Rover with this fucking little thing, right?
[02:50:16.860 --> 02:50:18.060]  That little thing is creepy.
[02:50:18.620 --> 02:50:21.500]  More if you really study what that what that phone can do.
[02:50:21.500 --> 02:50:22.620]  And I have one myself.
[02:50:23.420 --> 02:50:27.260]  But what what it's really capable of doing and the way that it's tracking.
[02:50:27.260 --> 02:50:32.060]  I don't know if people follow the Facebook stuff lately in Congress or the TikTok stuff.
[02:50:32.060 --> 02:50:34.300]  It's I believe this week in Congress.
[02:50:34.300 --> 02:50:37.020]  I encourage you guys to at least watch the snippets on that stuff.
[02:50:38.220 --> 02:50:44.780]  The power of technology is way over our heads on what can be achieved and what can be done.
[02:50:45.100 --> 02:50:49.420]  With a with a few keystrokes, what they can find out about you.
[02:50:50.540 --> 02:50:56.460]  So Julian Assange, you know, I feel that that kind of stuff, man.
[02:50:57.900 --> 02:50:59.100]  Edward Snowden.
[02:50:59.100 --> 02:51:03.260]  You know, I don't I don't think enough Americans know those gentlemen's names.
[02:51:03.980 --> 02:51:08.540]  So if you've never heard of those two people, you need to Google what what especially what
[02:51:08.540 --> 02:51:09.980]  Edward Snowden did.
[02:51:09.980 --> 02:51:11.980]  Julian Assange kind of did it a little recklessly.
[02:51:11.980 --> 02:51:19.100]  But Edward Snowden, I feel like did it responsibly and just the balls to be a young individual
[02:51:19.100 --> 02:51:19.820]  with everything.
[02:51:21.900 --> 02:51:26.380]  The lifestyle that that gentleman had living in Hawaii, making a ton of money and then
[02:51:26.380 --> 02:51:29.180]  choosing to basically go up against the government.
[02:51:29.180 --> 02:51:34.060]  And I would say that most people probably under 30 years old don't know his name.
[02:51:35.740 --> 02:51:36.240]  No.
[02:51:38.460 --> 02:51:40.940]  It's fucking sad, man, because that guy gave up everything.
[02:51:40.940 --> 02:51:44.780]  And however you feel about those individuals, I guess I could get that, too.
[02:51:45.660 --> 02:51:50.860]  But from the Snowden side of things, I don't know how you wouldn't consider that gentleman
[02:51:50.860 --> 02:51:51.580]  a patriot.
[02:51:51.580 --> 02:51:54.300]  And more people should know about him.
[02:51:54.300 --> 02:51:58.140]  So if you've never checked that out, definitely Google Edward Snowden.
[02:51:58.140 --> 02:52:00.780]  Granted, Julian Assange, he's in the news and all that kind of stuff.
[02:52:00.780 --> 02:52:07.580]  But to be fair, I felt like the way that those things were revealed was reckless, where Snowden
[02:52:07.580 --> 02:52:11.900]  worked with a guy named Glenn Greenwald and kind of revealed it to the world with his
[02:52:11.900 --> 02:52:12.460]  little crew.
[02:52:13.180 --> 02:52:20.460]  And I felt like the way that that was done was brilliant, almost like movie-esque, you
[02:52:20.460 --> 02:52:20.940]  know?
[02:52:20.940 --> 02:52:23.020]  I don't know if you guys know the full story on all that kind of stuff.
[02:52:23.020 --> 02:52:24.140]  There's a few movies out there.
[02:52:24.140 --> 02:52:31.340]  But if you follow the story of how he revealed it to the world, it was an ultimate chess
[02:52:31.340 --> 02:52:31.840]  move.
[02:52:32.940 --> 02:52:33.440]  Yeah, it was.
[02:52:34.000 --> 02:52:40.160]  So just to get a little balance here, because some people's heads are exploding in the chat
[02:52:40.160 --> 02:52:40.660]  right now.
[02:52:42.240 --> 02:52:44.720]  Just some counter-arguments.
[02:52:45.600 --> 02:52:46.480]  That's not true.
[02:52:46.480 --> 02:52:48.720]  Babel's Law has not been proven to be a fraud.
[02:52:48.720 --> 02:52:56.960]  And if you check out a few interviews, you should definitely get a different opinion
[02:52:56.960 --> 02:52:57.460]  on that.
[02:52:59.200 --> 02:53:00.480]  I don't feel that's true at all.
[02:53:01.440 --> 02:53:05.760]  There's a part two of this statement, if I can find it.
[02:53:12.470 --> 02:53:13.190]  Saint Bernard's.
[02:53:15.510 --> 02:53:16.630]  Yeah, here we go.
[02:53:16.630 --> 02:53:17.110]  I know.
[02:53:17.110 --> 02:53:18.790]  Sorry, that's not the right one.
[02:53:27.170 --> 02:53:28.210]  Talk about aliens.
[02:53:29.490 --> 02:53:31.090]  Do we have any questions, people?
[02:53:31.090 --> 02:53:32.690]  Because we're pushing through hours here.
[02:53:33.570 --> 02:53:34.690]  It's Halloween.
[02:53:34.690 --> 02:53:35.890]  We're allowed to get off topic.
[02:53:36.370 --> 02:53:42.210]  So Brian, in the same way that other people explore Bob Lazar, Saint Bernard's homework
[02:53:42.210 --> 02:53:44.770]  assignment for you is to explore Jeremy Reese.
[02:53:45.810 --> 02:53:46.850]  And then we can come back.
[02:53:46.850 --> 02:53:47.570]  OK, fair enough.
[02:53:49.410 --> 02:53:56.130]  So Brian's going to read about Jeremy Reese, and other people can read about Bob, or both
[02:53:56.130 --> 02:53:57.490]  Bob Lazar and Jeremy Reese.
[02:53:58.050 --> 02:54:01.410]  And Bob Lazar didn't give out all of his information.
[02:54:01.410 --> 02:54:06.850]  I would say that as an engineer who has had a lot of information that was worth money,
[02:54:07.730 --> 02:54:10.050]  you don't say everything that was going on.
[02:54:11.650 --> 02:54:12.290]  That's for sure.
[02:54:13.170 --> 02:54:13.730]  So I do.
[02:54:14.290 --> 02:54:16.610]  Maybe he said false things on purpose.
[02:54:19.730 --> 02:54:23.410]  I feel like the most candid thing, if you really want to dive deep into that, is just
[02:54:23.410 --> 02:54:25.330]  watch his interview on Joe Rogan.
[02:54:25.330 --> 02:54:28.770]  Joe Rogan asks him all the hard questions.
[02:54:28.770 --> 02:54:33.090]  And time and time again, he comes up with and proves some of the things that I'm sure
[02:54:33.090 --> 02:54:35.650]  Jeremy is talking about, how he didn't go to these certain things.
[02:54:36.290 --> 02:54:41.730]  And then they come back with a article where it's proving that he did actually attend these
[02:54:41.730 --> 02:54:44.130]  schools or go to these places because he won awards.
[02:54:45.970 --> 02:54:46.610]  Hey!
[02:54:46.610 --> 02:54:48.290]  Hey, I'm coming to you with facts, dude.
[02:54:48.290 --> 02:54:48.930]  Hey!
[02:54:48.930 --> 02:54:49.650]  You know, whatever.
[02:54:50.290 --> 02:54:51.250]  You don't want to listen to it?
[02:54:51.250 --> 02:54:51.890]  That's fine, too.
[02:54:52.610 --> 02:54:53.890]  But I'm sure there are people that want to write that.
[02:54:53.890 --> 02:54:54.370]  Hold on, Brian.
[02:54:54.370 --> 02:54:55.410]  Let me just stop you there.
[02:54:55.410 --> 02:54:56.370]  They're not facts.
[02:54:56.610 --> 02:55:00.210]  I'm just going to step in for a second.
[02:55:01.810 --> 02:55:03.330]  All of this is opinions.
[02:55:03.330 --> 02:55:06.850]  I don't think any of us can talk factually on any of this stuff.
[02:55:06.850 --> 02:55:11.890]  So to say that one side or the other is absolute truth or fact, I would push back on.
[02:55:13.810 --> 02:55:20.770]  OK, well, I would push back that there are it is proven that Bob Lazar worked at whatever
[02:55:20.770 --> 02:55:22.610]  you want to call that spot.
[02:55:23.570 --> 02:55:28.130]  So what he is saying there, I guess, is whether you want to believe that or not.
[02:55:28.130 --> 02:55:33.330]  But what I'm saying fact-wise is that a lot of the stuff that has come up in that interview
[02:55:33.330 --> 02:55:36.770]  with Joe Rogan, Joe Rogan presses them on that stuff.
[02:55:36.770 --> 02:55:40.530]  And you can see for yourself and choose for yourself whatever you want to believe.
[02:55:40.530 --> 02:55:47.730]  I'm not advocating one way or the other other than those are facts that have been proven.
[02:55:48.610 --> 02:55:51.810]  And if you don't agree with that part, then I guess we'll disagree on that.
[02:55:53.490 --> 02:55:54.450]  Agree to disagree.
[02:55:56.770 --> 02:55:59.410]  Yes, there are a variety.
[02:55:59.410 --> 02:56:02.050]  I and again, I have no opinion.
[02:56:02.050 --> 02:56:03.330]  I don't even know who this dude is.
[02:56:03.330 --> 02:56:11.730]  I'm just trying to balance the various viewpoints in the conversation.
[02:56:14.210 --> 02:56:19.490]  I think if you see a UFO, it makes you think differently, though, in some ways, you know,
[02:56:20.050 --> 02:56:22.530]  like you want to tell us about your experience.
[02:56:23.250 --> 02:56:24.850]  All right, we'll go there.
[02:56:24.850 --> 02:56:25.570]  I will go there.
[02:56:26.370 --> 02:56:29.730]  OK, because it's a really emotional story for me, honestly.
[02:56:31.890 --> 02:56:37.170]  So when I was younger, you know, 18, whatever, I was with my one friend.
[02:56:37.170 --> 02:56:44.050]  We lived in the dorms over in Ohio, near a place called Akron, where we had done some
[02:56:44.770 --> 02:56:45.970]  chemical engineering.
[02:56:45.970 --> 02:56:48.930]  That's where I did my chemical engineering, lived with some family for a while, got some
[02:56:48.930 --> 02:56:49.570]  family out there.
[02:56:50.370 --> 02:56:53.730]  So I was out there and we were talking smack.
[02:56:53.730 --> 02:56:59.570]  We were frustrated to a point that we would yell at the sky and we'd be like, these aliens
[02:57:00.290 --> 02:57:01.810]  show yourselves.
[02:57:01.810 --> 02:57:03.170]  We know this is happening.
[02:57:03.170 --> 02:57:03.410]  Right.
[02:57:03.410 --> 02:57:04.450]  We'd get all frustrated.
[02:57:05.970 --> 02:57:13.250]  And essentially, one day we're sitting outside and I'm looking up at the sky and I saw this
[02:57:13.250 --> 02:57:15.410]  sort of thing in the sky that looked like a plane.
[02:57:15.410 --> 02:57:15.650]  Right.
[02:57:15.890 --> 02:57:22.530]  And I kept watching it and it turned from looking like a plane into looking like a UFO
[02:57:23.330 --> 02:57:26.850]  with a different set of lights and all the and started moving differently.
[02:57:27.730 --> 02:57:31.330]  This is not the first time I've seen a UFO, but this one was in particular.
[02:57:31.890 --> 02:57:38.850]  It then zoomed over on top of us and then gave off this light and then we couldn't scream.
[02:57:38.850 --> 02:57:40.450]  We couldn't move or anything.
[02:57:40.450 --> 02:57:42.770]  I swear to God, I don't care what anyone thinks about me.
[02:57:43.730 --> 02:57:46.450]  I don't care because I know what happened.
[02:57:46.450 --> 02:57:46.690]  Right.
[02:57:46.690 --> 02:57:50.450]  So that this that comes down on us, it leaves instantly.
[02:57:50.450 --> 02:57:51.250]  It's gone.
[02:57:51.250 --> 02:57:56.530]  And we scream at the top of our lungs and we both jump in my car and I'm speeding off.
[02:57:56.530 --> 02:57:58.210]  And my friend's like, dude, they're in a spaceship.
[02:57:58.930 --> 02:57:59.970]  Why are you speeding?
[02:58:02.130 --> 02:58:03.890]  I was like, it's a good point.
[02:58:04.530 --> 02:58:09.410]  So, I mean, if you when you see something you can't explain, even if it's just a traditional
[02:58:09.410 --> 02:58:14.610]  UFO in the sky, it might change your viewpoint on what's possible or not.
[02:58:16.290 --> 02:58:17.090]  It's enlightening.
[02:58:17.970 --> 02:58:18.290]  Yeah.
[02:58:18.290 --> 02:58:23.170]  So, I mean, I just I just share my experience because it made me feel as though we're part
[02:58:23.170 --> 02:58:25.330]  of more than just this Earth family.
[02:58:25.330 --> 02:58:28.850]  We're part of this galactic family if we allow ourselves to be.
[02:58:28.850 --> 02:58:32.930]  So I don't think that we're like this sort of like rubbish on this planet.
[02:58:32.930 --> 02:58:36.530]  I think that we are a beautiful thing and that's why we're being cultivated.
[02:58:36.530 --> 02:58:38.050]  And that's what I'd like to believe.
[02:58:38.930 --> 02:58:42.210]  But as for them coming down, I think it was a cognitive test.
[02:58:43.410 --> 02:58:46.130]  They were like, OK, we have to come in and say, what's up?
[02:58:46.130 --> 02:58:47.410]  Give them a cognitive test.
[02:58:50.530 --> 02:58:55.970]  And then they're like, oh, are these guys all smart enough for us to not yet?
[02:58:55.970 --> 02:58:57.170]  We need to score higher.
[02:58:59.490 --> 02:59:00.690]  Not ready to deal with them.
[02:59:00.690 --> 02:59:02.130]  They can't they can't handle us.
[02:59:04.610 --> 02:59:06.050]  I love the tinfoil hat, man.
[02:59:08.050 --> 02:59:10.290]  Went down the yellow brick road today, that's for sure.
[02:59:13.330 --> 02:59:15.170]  Brian, do you have any bizarre stories?
[02:59:16.530 --> 02:59:23.090]  Oh, no, I will say that I used to go down south to Colorado to trim with a gentleman
[02:59:23.090 --> 02:59:26.690]  who was an underground legend, if you will.
[02:59:27.410 --> 02:59:31.250]  And he would talk about when he was out there that he would see certain stuff and the bright
[02:59:31.250 --> 02:59:34.370]  lights would shine down on him because he would work at like two, three in the morning.
[02:59:35.170 --> 02:59:40.930]  And the way that he would describe it, you know, for the most part, I felt like, you
[02:59:40.930 --> 02:59:42.210]  know, the stories could be true.
[02:59:43.730 --> 02:59:45.410]  But at the end of the day, man, I don't know.
[02:59:45.410 --> 02:59:47.410]  You can see a lot of I've seen a lot of shit in the sky.
[02:59:47.410 --> 02:59:51.570]  I've actually seen one time when I was in college, I remember seeing a balloon with
[02:59:51.570 --> 02:59:56.450]  like I guess it had like a bright light or something attached to it and the wind was
[02:59:56.450 --> 02:59:58.930]  blowing it in our little town for like 30 minutes.
[02:59:59.890 --> 03:00:03.730]  This was probably in 1999 or 2000.
[03:00:04.610 --> 03:00:09.330]  We thought that that was a UFO, you know, and it was just like a big ass balloon with
[03:00:09.330 --> 03:00:10.530]  like some lights tied to it.
[03:00:10.530 --> 03:00:14.130]  But the way that it was moving around with the wind, it totally looked like something
[03:00:14.130 --> 03:00:14.610]  crazy.
[03:00:14.610 --> 03:00:15.890]  So I don't know.
[03:00:15.890 --> 03:00:17.570]  I mean, you could see a lot of things in the sky.
[03:00:18.130 --> 03:00:23.730]  And all I was trying to say to say this is just it's amazing to me when some things are
[03:00:23.730 --> 03:00:25.570]  starting to be corroborated.
[03:00:26.210 --> 03:00:31.410]  Can't even talk anymore when when your entire life, you know, you've always kind of
[03:00:31.410 --> 03:00:32.370]  wondered about that stuff.
[03:00:32.370 --> 03:00:36.930]  So if you've personally seen it, Professor Blountstache, you know, I believe that, man.
[03:00:36.930 --> 03:00:39.010]  I believe that the people that have seen that stuff.
[03:00:39.730 --> 03:00:42.690]  I also believe that a lot of people make that shit up 100 percent.
[03:00:42.690 --> 03:00:46.210]  You know, the same thing with like clairvoyance and all that kind of stuff.
[03:00:46.210 --> 03:00:49.730]  And I think 99 percent of those people are bullshitting.
[03:00:49.730 --> 03:00:53.330]  But then you find out about people like Edgar Cayce that seem like they might have had that
[03:00:53.330 --> 03:00:53.970]  kind of power.
[03:00:54.770 --> 03:00:55.730]  Who knows?
[03:00:55.730 --> 03:00:59.810]  You know, but I do believe that the metaphysical side of life does exist.
[03:00:59.810 --> 03:01:05.810]  Maybe that's the part of the library that of Alexandria that we lost as humanity.
[03:01:05.810 --> 03:01:07.650]  But it seems like nobody wants to talk about that.
[03:01:07.650 --> 03:01:11.650]  And if it was passed down, they used to even call those things mystery schools.
[03:01:12.370 --> 03:01:13.330]  That was the name of it.
[03:01:13.330 --> 03:01:19.970]  And like Leonardo DiCaprio, Leonardo da Vinci used to go to those things and stuff.
[03:01:19.970 --> 03:01:24.770]  And I guess that's where a lot of that knowledge comes from.
[03:01:24.770 --> 03:01:26.370]  And it could be total bullshit, too.
[03:01:26.370 --> 03:01:30.370]  You know, so St. Bernard, you know, these are the things that I've seen, man.
[03:01:31.010 --> 03:01:35.010]  And I feel like I just wanted to share that with individuals that might not have ever
[03:01:35.010 --> 03:01:38.930]  gone down this road or would never put a tinfoil hat on like Professor Blountstache.
[03:01:38.930 --> 03:01:42.530]  Yeah, it's like, what would I gain?
[03:01:42.530 --> 03:01:44.610]  And that's what I try to say about some of these people.
[03:01:44.610 --> 03:01:49.090]  Like when you say a story like that, I don't really have anything to gain,
[03:01:49.090 --> 03:01:52.370]  except now y'all just know I'm a little wacky, you know.
[03:01:52.370 --> 03:01:58.530]  And so I just feel like it's good to take it and think about it from a personal perspective.
[03:01:58.530 --> 03:02:02.130]  And if you really do, just yell up at the sky at them for a while.
[03:02:02.130 --> 03:02:03.730]  And I'm pretty sure they'll come down.
[03:02:03.730 --> 03:02:05.170]  They'll cognitively test you.
[03:02:05.170 --> 03:02:06.130]  I don't know if you'll remember.
[03:02:06.130 --> 03:02:09.730]  I definitely don't want to test that.
[03:02:09.730 --> 03:02:15.010]  I love you this way, guys.
[03:02:15.010 --> 03:02:16.130]  I appreciate you guys.
[03:02:16.130 --> 03:02:17.730]  You're real weird.
[03:02:17.890 --> 03:02:18.770]  You're brother.
[03:02:18.770 --> 03:02:22.690]  So I'll share my experiences on the UFO.
[03:02:22.690 --> 03:02:25.570]  Some other ones I'm not prepared to share yet.
[03:02:25.570 --> 03:02:32.930]  But so I've met probably five people in my life that all swear they've seen them.
[03:02:33.810 --> 03:02:41.090]  And the most the one that I cannot deny was what happened in Bantam, Connecticut.
[03:02:42.690 --> 03:02:45.650]  It was back in the I think it was the 90s.
[03:02:46.130 --> 03:02:48.210]  So it was present modern day.
[03:02:49.010 --> 03:02:54.690]  And like half the town saw this ship.
[03:02:54.690 --> 03:02:58.450]  And the cops actually chased the fucking ship down the road.
[03:02:59.330 --> 03:03:01.490]  And it went into Bantam Lake.
[03:03:01.490 --> 03:03:04.210]  And all the people around Bantam Lake saw it.
[03:03:04.210 --> 03:03:05.250]  They saw the wave.
[03:03:05.250 --> 03:03:06.290]  They saw the splash.
[03:03:07.010 --> 03:03:12.850]  And the next day, all these black friggin limos or whatever they're called, the SUVs roll up.
[03:03:12.850 --> 03:03:15.410]  And all these guys come out and they start searching.
[03:03:15.410 --> 03:03:17.410]  And they had boats out there.
[03:03:17.410 --> 03:03:23.970]  They did radar, sonar, depth finding, everything they could to try to find this object.
[03:03:23.970 --> 03:03:26.530]  And so and it was in the newspaper headlines.
[03:03:26.530 --> 03:03:27.730]  The cops saw it.
[03:03:27.730 --> 03:03:29.890]  Everybody testified that they witnessed this.
[03:03:30.530 --> 03:03:31.730]  That's fucking undeniable.
[03:03:31.730 --> 03:03:33.090]  It's not one person.
[03:03:33.090 --> 03:03:37.410]  It's you know, and especially you start getting law officers involved in it.
[03:03:37.410 --> 03:03:42.450]  And then you see, you know, these black fucking SUVs come up and start doing,
[03:03:42.450 --> 03:03:45.010]  you know, launching boats and doing all this shit for weeks.
[03:03:47.090 --> 03:03:48.370]  You can't fucking deny that shit.
[03:03:50.050 --> 03:03:51.250]  So it's real.
[03:03:51.250 --> 03:03:51.890]  It's legit.
[03:03:53.570 --> 03:03:56.290]  So anyway, that's my opinion on them.
[03:03:57.090 --> 03:03:58.370]  Yeah, they're fucking real.
[03:03:58.370 --> 03:03:59.170]  They're undeniable.
[03:04:02.610 --> 03:04:04.930]  All right, Peter, is everyone pissed off and offended now?
[03:04:07.410 --> 03:04:10.050]  I don't know.
[03:04:10.050 --> 03:04:13.890]  We definitely went crazy rabbles.
[03:04:13.890 --> 03:04:15.090]  Yeah, no, Peter's back.
[03:04:15.090 --> 03:04:22.290]  Peter has been multitasking, packing seed packs up and listening and trying to balance
[03:04:25.970 --> 03:04:27.970]  various viewpoints to the best.
[03:04:28.850 --> 03:04:29.970]  Well done today, Peter.
[03:04:29.970 --> 03:04:30.450]  Well done.
[03:04:32.370 --> 03:04:37.170]  Yeah, so it's having fun on a Halloween show.
[03:04:38.370 --> 03:04:41.490]  I actually as we're doing that, I was thinking it'd be fun.
[03:04:43.650 --> 03:04:50.770]  Like, I remember a long time, like I used to do kind of my interviews and I'd bring
[03:04:50.770 --> 03:04:57.330]  like like I remember with the guy, Jody and Cameron from Fiddler's Greens and that whole
[03:04:57.330 --> 03:04:57.570]  crew.
[03:04:57.570 --> 03:05:06.290]  I remember one time, you know, I had like it was like me by myself as a one man crew,
[03:05:06.290 --> 03:05:13.970]  like three or four cameras, like multiple audio devices doing the interview as like
[03:05:13.970 --> 03:05:21.490]  we walk through their entire lineup of flower and just getting high as fuck trying to like
[03:05:21.490 --> 03:05:25.810]  hold everything, being like, you know, thinking about the cameras, thinking about the audio,
[03:05:25.810 --> 03:05:29.890]  trying to ask like questions and just getting higher and higher and higher.
[03:05:29.970 --> 03:05:37.730]  And I was thinking it'd be fun if we all did like either DMT or some other like just
[03:05:37.730 --> 03:05:43.810]  something where just everybody is fucked up and and we're rolling and see where the
[03:05:43.810 --> 03:05:44.850]  conversation goes.
[03:05:45.650 --> 03:05:47.570]  Have you done DMT, Peter?
[03:05:47.570 --> 03:05:48.130]  I have not.
[03:05:48.850 --> 03:05:54.690]  I don't to be honest with you, if we all blasted off, we I don't know if we'd be able
[03:05:54.690 --> 03:05:55.090]  to talk.
[03:05:55.410 --> 03:05:56.210]  I know you just.
[03:05:57.570 --> 03:06:01.890]  Well, that's what I was thinking, because my role would have to be to like press buttons.
[03:06:01.890 --> 03:06:09.250]  I remember even I don't know if Cheddar Bob's still watching, but we were talking hash and
[03:06:09.250 --> 03:06:17.490]  I I started dabbing and I literally like could not function like I my head was down here
[03:06:18.450 --> 03:06:20.690]  and I couldn't move.
[03:06:20.690 --> 03:06:26.450]  I think it was either him and Mr. Toad or I can't remember who it was, but and I was
[03:06:26.450 --> 03:06:28.450]  just like dabbing a lot.
[03:06:30.130 --> 03:06:32.450]  That's why I can't pronounce words at the end of the show.
[03:06:33.490 --> 03:06:35.490]  Yeah, you could do mushrooms and talk.
[03:06:35.490 --> 03:06:37.490]  DMT is going to fucking skyrocket.
[03:06:40.370 --> 03:06:41.970]  You want to go down a small rabbit hole with that?
[03:06:41.970 --> 03:06:44.210]  I feel like there's two versions of DMT.
[03:06:44.210 --> 03:06:45.970]  So there's there's like DMT.
[03:06:45.970 --> 03:06:51.650]  I feel like you could do it in like a club atmosphere and that's has a uniqueness to
[03:06:51.650 --> 03:06:52.050]  it.
[03:06:52.050 --> 03:06:56.210]  And then there's DMT blasting off where there's like people around you and it feels like a
[03:06:56.210 --> 03:06:58.610]  ceremony and wherever the fuck you go on that.
[03:06:58.610 --> 03:07:03.730]  It seems like the same people that also had that kind of experience of blasting off.
[03:07:03.730 --> 03:07:07.730]  Some of the people see the same things, and that's the part that intrigued me about it.
[03:07:07.730 --> 03:07:13.090]  I don't know anything other than that about DMT, but I will say that that will open your
[03:07:13.090 --> 03:07:15.330]  eye to, OK, wow.
[03:07:15.330 --> 03:07:22.050]  Like there's something pretty cool about this planet, just the Milky Way system, just where
[03:07:22.050 --> 03:07:23.010]  we live in general.
[03:07:23.730 --> 03:07:26.370]  If you want to experience that and kind of see that for yourself.
[03:07:27.090 --> 03:07:30.130]  Yes, I did fall asleep during that conversation.
[03:07:31.650 --> 03:07:33.170]  You actually fell asleep?
[03:07:33.170 --> 03:07:33.410]  Yeah.
[03:07:34.770 --> 03:07:38.610]  So I made like I made both of them big and me off camera.
[03:07:38.610 --> 03:07:39.010]  Cheers.
[03:07:40.130 --> 03:07:44.450]  And yeah, I was like, I just hope.
[03:07:44.450 --> 03:07:49.650]  Fortunately, both of them are chatty, so there wasn't like a big break in the conversation.
[03:07:51.570 --> 03:07:52.450]  Peter went down.
[03:07:54.610 --> 03:07:55.890]  So what do you think, Professor?
[03:07:55.890 --> 03:08:01.890]  Do you it seems like there's like a mild version of DMT and then the blast off version, if
[03:08:01.890 --> 03:08:02.210]  you will?
[03:08:03.170 --> 03:08:10.610]  Well, luckily, you know, I've had a few experiences with it and I feel as though it really
[03:08:10.610 --> 03:08:12.370]  depends on, you know, where it's coming from.
[03:08:12.370 --> 03:08:13.330]  Exactly.
[03:08:13.330 --> 03:08:14.850]  There's definitely the different types.
[03:08:16.050 --> 03:08:20.290]  I don't have to get into the chemistry of those, but in particular, they do affect the
[03:08:20.290 --> 03:08:23.970]  same sort of brain function in the same receptors.
[03:08:24.850 --> 03:08:31.490]  I do feel as though the heavier, the heavier one, the more ceremonial one is definitely
[03:08:31.490 --> 03:08:37.250]  more of a pure, whereas the one maybe more of the chill one is maybe even kind of mixed
[03:08:37.250 --> 03:08:38.850]  with herbs or things like that.
[03:08:39.810 --> 03:08:44.930]  So at the end of the day, I feel as though that it'll bring you almost anywhere you need
[03:08:44.930 --> 03:08:45.730]  to go.
[03:08:45.730 --> 03:08:50.850]  And a lot of ways I've had some experiences that have taught me a lot, but I've also had
[03:08:50.850 --> 03:08:55.170]  experiences that were very harsh, you know, one.
[03:08:55.170 --> 03:09:01.970]  I mean, I don't want to go too deep, but one time, you know, I went down into the area
[03:09:02.770 --> 03:09:05.330]  and I was confronted by a being.
[03:09:06.290 --> 03:09:13.010]  And this being was just telling me to stop fucking up and wake up earlier and get up
[03:09:13.010 --> 03:09:17.490]  early and pretty much told me to stop being, you know, lazy and these sort of things.
[03:09:18.210 --> 03:09:25.090]  So I do think, you know, it's definitely an experience that you need to have to understand
[03:09:25.650 --> 03:09:31.650]  that it is a completely different sort of consciousness and that when we are expanding
[03:09:31.650 --> 03:09:36.850]  and we're creating our bodies of more of this living soil, regenerative, clean medicine,
[03:09:36.850 --> 03:09:42.770]  and our bodies are regenerating in seven years that we can be able to experience this more,
[03:09:42.770 --> 03:09:43.570]  I feel.
[03:09:43.570 --> 03:09:45.970]  So I think it definitely ties in together.
[03:09:45.970 --> 03:09:50.300]  Yeah, man.
[03:09:50.300 --> 03:09:51.820]  That was a lot of fun.
[03:09:51.820 --> 03:09:52.300]  Yeah.
[03:09:52.300 --> 03:09:57.580]  And you guys, you've got to understand, too, that there's a lot of stuff out there.
[03:09:58.060 --> 03:10:05.180]  You know, DMT, then there's MDMA, MDM.
[03:10:07.340 --> 03:10:11.980]  There's secretions of toads, there's peyote.
[03:10:11.980 --> 03:10:22.700]  There's a lot of shit that we haven't really dealt with or utilized because of the demonization
[03:10:22.700 --> 03:10:27.180]  of these things by the powers that be.
[03:10:27.260 --> 03:10:32.380]  And so, you know, it's finally it's great to see that, you know, mushrooms are going to be
[03:10:32.380 --> 03:10:37.260]  used in treating therapy instead of, you know, antidepressants and anti-anxieties.
[03:10:37.260 --> 03:10:43.500]  You know, I think that, you know, that's going to be a huge game changer because you can.
[03:10:43.500 --> 03:10:51.820]  It's been proven you can rewire your brain and you can allow more positive chemicals
[03:10:51.820 --> 03:10:59.180]  to be released in your brain or manufactured instead of using something that's masking or
[03:11:00.220 --> 03:11:05.500]  cheating, you know, a compound that breaks down and requires more and more and more of it.
[03:11:06.460 --> 03:11:11.340]  So, you know, I think that the future is bright and I think that, you know, unfortunately,
[03:11:12.460 --> 03:11:19.500]  we don't have ethical pharmaceutical companies that are allowing new companies to come in play.
[03:11:20.300 --> 03:11:25.900]  They're either gobbled up immediately or they're pushed to the brink of financial disaster before
[03:11:25.900 --> 03:11:33.180]  they can actually accomplish anything positive, which is sad. It's again, you know, this control
[03:11:33.180 --> 03:11:37.500]  that's been put over us because we could have done so much better as a species. I mean, if you
[03:11:37.500 --> 03:11:43.260]  think about it, if we never went to war, we never fought each other, where the fuck would we be now?
[03:11:43.260 --> 03:11:49.980]  Right. Probably colonized other fucking planets, but we've we waste all our money
[03:11:49.980 --> 03:11:57.500]  blowing each other up and then rebuilding it. I just don't fucking get it. If we'd all taken
[03:11:57.500 --> 03:12:05.420]  mushrooms and constantly smoked weed, why would we fight? Right. There would be nothing but love
[03:12:05.420 --> 03:12:14.060]  on the planet and the potential for, you know, huge leaps in right directions would have happened
[03:12:14.060 --> 03:12:18.940]  instead of what we've done to ourselves instead. But that's my two cents on that issue.
[03:12:20.620 --> 03:12:26.140]  Well said. Should we steer it back with questions? So people want to ask Mr. Bluntstache?
[03:12:27.420 --> 03:12:28.540]  Yeah. What do you guys want to ask?
[03:12:28.780 --> 03:12:30.140]  Real quick, please.
[03:12:33.180 --> 03:12:34.220]  Talk about plants.
[03:12:36.380 --> 03:12:37.500]  Is that what it says?
[03:12:37.500 --> 03:12:41.740]  Yeah. I was going to find, I think earlier it was either him or.
[03:12:44.300 --> 03:12:49.500]  Sorry, Joe. I think sometimes, though, it's good to talk about a little bit other than,
[03:12:50.380 --> 03:12:52.780]  you know, where else could you talk about?
[03:12:54.300 --> 03:12:55.740]  Back to earth. Reel it in.
[03:12:56.460 --> 03:12:58.700]  Hold on. Take another hit.
[03:13:06.620 --> 03:13:09.660]  Yes. It's what On Demand's for.
[03:13:15.230 --> 03:13:18.110]  Yeah, I believe there's a lot of shady shit we don't need to know about.
[03:13:18.110 --> 03:13:20.350]  And then on the other side.
[03:13:21.550 --> 03:13:22.270]  Great details.
[03:13:22.750 --> 03:13:28.590]  Well, hopefully we got a few of you to think about something a little bit deeper than just
[03:13:28.590 --> 03:13:32.990]  growing weed, because that's something else I don't. I don't know about you guys, but sometimes
[03:13:32.990 --> 03:13:36.190]  people get so wrapped up in that, especially when they first get into it. It's all they want to talk
[03:13:36.190 --> 03:13:40.590]  to you about. It's like all they live and breathe. And it's like, yeah, there's other shit, other
[03:13:40.590 --> 03:13:41.950]  hobbies, other things.
[03:13:43.470 --> 03:13:51.390]  So I guess if you root drenched or foliar fed LSD, would anything happen to your plants?
[03:13:52.350 --> 03:13:53.630]  Is how I'm reading this question.
[03:13:54.510 --> 03:13:59.550]  Well, I mean, the compounds would probably transfer.
[03:14:00.430 --> 03:14:02.670]  Yeah, the compounds would probably transfer.
[03:14:04.430 --> 03:14:10.350]  Whether they would be bioactivated, I don't know. That's a good question.
[03:14:11.470 --> 03:14:16.990]  I look forward to it. Someone's going to do it and get back to us on that.
[03:14:17.950 --> 03:14:24.510]  I do think the mushrooms can grow with them. I've seen people like Steensland doing a little
[03:14:24.510 --> 03:14:29.470]  bit on the bottom there and some of the non-sterile interface doing some of that.
[03:14:29.470 --> 03:14:36.190]  So that was pretty cool. If you don't know, there's wood chip based mushrooms that contain
[03:14:36.190 --> 03:14:42.110]  certain molecules of interest that work very well as a mulch layer, although a lot of them
[03:14:42.110 --> 03:14:49.070]  don't fruit in the right conditions for us to do them inside of a crop or inside of a
[03:14:49.070 --> 03:14:54.990]  flowering room. But I think that those two definitely have synergy. I mean, I don't think
[03:14:54.990 --> 03:14:59.070]  a lot of people do it, but you can.
[03:15:01.790 --> 03:15:02.990]  This one's for Leighton.
[03:15:03.310 --> 03:15:13.070]  Go to fishbrew.com. He's got an amazing product called Bold Flow. It's a one-shot living
[03:15:13.710 --> 03:15:21.950]  entire ecosystem. It's an amazing product. I use it in everything I do. I've been working in the
[03:15:22.510 --> 03:15:29.390]  aquaculture industry for about 12 years now, going to different sites and collecting fish poop
[03:15:29.710 --> 03:15:37.070]  and working with it. So that's a great way to inoculate a brand new bed that you just built
[03:15:37.710 --> 03:15:45.310]  or to jumpstart an aquarium. The other trick too is urine. If you put a small amount of urine,
[03:15:45.310 --> 03:15:53.390]  your urine into a fish tank, the biology will start to break it down and start the,
[03:15:53.390 --> 03:16:04.110]  what's called nitrification cycle. So that's where we take it from nitrite to nitrate.
[03:16:04.110 --> 03:16:10.510]  And the nitrate is harmless. So it goes ammonia is the first thing broken down to nitrite,
[03:16:10.510 --> 03:16:14.750]  which is harmful to plants and then to nitrate, which is not harmful to plants.
[03:16:15.310 --> 03:16:17.710]  So that's a good little trick to get you going there.
[03:16:20.030 --> 03:16:20.910]  Interesting question.
[03:16:23.710 --> 03:16:28.590]  Is that fish shit in the bottle any good? No, I've played with that. When they first came out,
[03:16:28.590 --> 03:16:34.350]  I got a sample of that stuff and it smells bad. The stuff that you get from Keith will smell sweet
[03:16:34.910 --> 03:16:41.070]  and that's where you know it's at the right level. It took me a couple of years to really
[03:16:41.070 --> 03:16:49.150]  figure out how to aerobically stabilize fish manure. And the key to starting it is
[03:16:50.110 --> 03:16:56.910]  it has to be as close to a high dissolved oxygen level as possible and has to have the right amount
[03:16:56.910 --> 03:17:02.110]  of minerals and nutrients in it. I had some stuff that took me literally two weeks to try to
[03:17:02.110 --> 03:17:08.270]  stabilize and I never could. I never could get it to smell sweet. So that's the trick. So if you've
[03:17:08.270 --> 03:17:14.110]  got an old fish filter or you've got fish gravel and you siphon out that stuff, you're going to
[03:17:14.110 --> 03:17:20.590]  smell it. It's going to smell bad. But as long as you actively aerate it with a blower, you will
[03:17:20.590 --> 03:17:24.910]  turn it to a sweet smell. And when you're at that sweet smell, you know you've got your protozoa,
[03:17:24.910 --> 03:17:31.070]  you've got rid of all of your ciliates. And of course, you're going to have nitrifying bacteria,
[03:17:31.630 --> 03:17:36.750]  potassium solubilizing bacteria, phosphate solubilizing bacteria. I know that there's
[03:17:36.750 --> 03:17:42.830]  a product on the market that a lot of eucanibus growers use. You can get it for free with this
[03:17:42.830 --> 03:17:48.910]  one. And they're grown what's called in vitro. So they're grown in nature. The ones that are sold
[03:17:48.910 --> 03:17:55.390]  on the market are grown in vitro. So they're grown in vivo, grown in nature, in vitro is grown in a
[03:17:55.390 --> 03:18:02.830]  lab. So the lab grown microbes, when you throw them out into nature, it's like taking a spoiled,
[03:18:02.830 --> 03:18:08.030]  wealthy kid who has never done anything. You throw him in the ghetto. How long is he going to last?
[03:18:08.750 --> 03:18:14.830]  Probably not long. But you take a ghetto kid and you throw him into a mansion with all the access,
[03:18:14.830 --> 03:18:20.350]  how well is he going to do? He's going to do better. So just keep that in mind, that anything,
[03:18:20.350 --> 03:18:25.310]  any kind of lab grown organisms, they're not going to last in the soil. They're just,
[03:18:25.310 --> 03:18:28.670]  they're not going to make it. They're just going to become what's called a bio-stimulant,
[03:18:28.670 --> 03:18:33.950]  so a food for an existing microbe. So if you're trying to get diversity, you need to have
[03:18:34.030 --> 03:18:37.390]  organisms that have been pulled out of nature, not grown in a lab.
[03:18:41.560 --> 03:18:46.520]  Conic Steve blew my mind with his dual road zone terpene production. Makes perfect sense though.
[03:18:46.520 --> 03:18:50.040]  Yeah, it does, man. Yeah, it does. And that boy's fucking smart as a whip.
[03:18:51.080 --> 03:18:54.760]  I have deep respect for him and the work that he's done, especially in the cannabis space.
[03:18:58.050 --> 03:19:03.810]  Anything else in there, Peter? I don't know about you boys, but I'm getting fucking hungry.
[03:19:04.690 --> 03:19:10.290]  Yeah, I gotta go hang with my three-year-old's been patiently waiting for me to hang out with
[03:19:10.290 --> 03:19:18.850]  her. Yeah, and Poe's been pretty good about today too. So anyway. Well, why don't we wrap on that?
[03:19:19.890 --> 03:19:24.690]  Appreciate you, Professor, kind of breaking down mutants. There's not a lot of people I feel like
[03:19:24.690 --> 03:19:29.250]  I could reach out to where we could even have this discussion and then go down all those different
[03:19:29.250 --> 03:19:34.930]  rabbit holes for sure. So this was a unique one and hats off to you for putting on the tinfoil hat.
[03:19:35.650 --> 03:19:40.050]  You as well, Leighton. Yeah, thank you. Thank you guys. And it was always great to chop it up.
[03:19:40.050 --> 03:19:42.450]  One stash, keep up the good work, man. I love what you're doing.
[03:19:43.970 --> 03:19:48.610]  Thank you guys. Appreciate you guys. Keep spreading the knowledge. Much love. Thank you.
[03:19:50.450 --> 03:19:51.970]  All right. Happy Halloween, everybody.
[03:19:52.210 --> 03:19:57.170]  Yes, Halloween. Happy Halloween. So just quickly, tonight we got Hota Herb
[03:19:59.330 --> 03:20:07.970]  at 6 p.m. Pacific. So what is it, 1.15 now? And then tomorrow we're going to do another clubhost
[03:20:07.970 --> 03:20:16.130]  with Leighton and someone on... Do we know who it is yet? I have a couple different guests. If we go
[03:20:16.690 --> 03:20:23.730]  off at 3, I'm all set. If we have to move up, then I'm going to have to find another place.
[03:20:23.730 --> 03:20:32.130]  No, we can do three. So at 3 and then at 4.20 on one of the two channels
[03:20:33.410 --> 03:20:37.810]  is going to be an Oaksterdam session. So...
[03:20:40.370 --> 03:20:43.490]  You're going to run two channels simultaneously? Yeah.
[03:20:44.450 --> 03:20:47.890]  All right. ESPN and ESPN2, baby.
[03:20:52.450 --> 03:20:56.930]  Yeah. So we're going to start with what the starting part of compost is,
[03:20:56.930 --> 03:21:02.050]  GOM, and then we're going to go directly to what the end result, which is like a biological
[03:21:02.050 --> 03:21:06.690]  management. And then we'll start getting into the really middle, where it's all the information.
[03:21:09.490 --> 03:21:11.330]  Do you know who's next week or not yet?
[03:21:12.290 --> 03:21:17.090]  Yeah, it's Hayden's Hash. Shout out to him. I personally smoked his stuff and he's going to
[03:21:17.090 --> 03:21:24.370]  talk about kind of revealing some of his gold nuggets to the community as we all are... As a
[03:21:24.370 --> 03:21:29.490]  community, everyone is chopping things down. I feel it's... I got a bunch of bright-minded people
[03:21:29.490 --> 03:21:33.650]  lined up so that you guys can take that flower if you choose to and maybe squish this year if
[03:21:33.650 --> 03:21:39.730]  you didn't do it last year. Hey, shout out to Mr. Tove for providing all that information.
[03:21:41.410 --> 03:21:46.050]  It's really hard to, you know, without an individual like that and other individuals
[03:21:46.050 --> 03:21:50.130]  in this community, it really is hard to dial in those kind of questions sometimes. So
[03:21:50.130 --> 03:21:53.730]  to get direct answers like that, we really, really appreciate that.
[03:21:54.930 --> 03:21:58.130]  Deep respect there, buddy. For all the work.
[03:21:58.130 --> 03:22:00.930]  Thank you, Professor. Appreciate you as well, bro.
[03:22:00.930 --> 03:22:07.010]  And that's my wife telling me to come hang out with my daughter. So all right, with that, bye.
