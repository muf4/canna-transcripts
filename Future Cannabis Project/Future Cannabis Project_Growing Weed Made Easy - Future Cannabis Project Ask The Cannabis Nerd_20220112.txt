[00:01.920 --> 00:12.760]  boom we are getting the room set up and ready to go with the experts roll in and
[00:12.760 --> 00:19.680]  we get our day started it is four o'clock PST and we have the get going
[00:19.680 --> 00:25.240]  with the experts happening right now so without any further ado I will roll in
[00:25.240 --> 00:28.400]  and get the show started
[00:31.920 --> 01:12.070]  hello hello
[01:12.270 --> 01:16.110]  how are we coming through on future cannabis guys how are we doing over
[01:16.110 --> 01:27.220]  there with the audio should be all good hello Johnny how are you doing as well
[01:27.220 --> 01:34.780]  moderator in there well the other guy is getting to join us looking nice
[01:34.780 --> 01:40.060]  should be a great start we have audio on the other side as always everything is
[01:40.060 --> 01:45.180]  going quite well and we have you know we'll have all of our experts come in as
[01:45.180 --> 01:49.980]  they come in I'm sure we'll have a lovely conversation today I have a
[01:49.980 --> 01:55.180]  couple of good questions to get it going but as usual this is ask the cannabis
[01:55.180 --> 01:59.700]  nerd cannabis 101 weekly live panel with future cannabis project where you
[01:59.700 --> 02:05.180]  get to come in ask your questions and get your answers as well as we can if
[02:05.180 --> 02:09.980]  you can challenge your experts to some more interesting questions we always
[02:09.980 --> 02:16.380]  love that week if we are big or small large or little it doesn't matter we're
[02:16.380 --> 02:19.980]  here to answer them all and I'm excited I don't know if you can all hear it in
[02:19.980 --> 02:25.860]  the background but it is raining hard here in Vancouver it is now about almost
[02:25.860 --> 02:29.740]  10 degrees Celsius so we're about 30 to 40 degrees warmer than the rest of
[02:29.740 --> 02:35.220]  Canada which is pretty nice so I won't brag too much dr. Anubis how are you
[02:35.220 --> 02:41.940]  doing today what are you excited about what did you learn this week if you want
[02:41.940 --> 02:46.140]  to get the conversation rolling there and I do have first question but on you
[02:46.140 --> 02:49.740]  Johnny to say hello and then we'll get
[02:49.740 --> 02:54.060]  yeah what did I learn this week well
[02:55.500 --> 03:06.260]  hmm that's a great question I don't know I'm in the middle of trying to create
[03:06.260 --> 03:15.380]  some formulations for a cosmetic surgeon using CBD and so I'm trying to figure out
[03:15.420 --> 03:20.500]  how to do like labels and stuff so I'm not really on the business side of
[03:20.500 --> 03:24.860]  cannabis I'm more on the research side so this is all new territory for me so I
[03:24.860 --> 03:31.380]  guess I learned how to do that not very interesting though no sometimes
[03:31.380 --> 03:37.780]  the lame-ass stuff is what about you Johnny what did you learn this week oh
[03:37.780 --> 03:43.460]  well I don't know if it's it's really something I learned but I got them to
[03:43.460 --> 03:51.620]  witness it and kind of relearn the hard way as far as buying expensive packs of
[03:51.620 --> 03:59.720]  seeds and having a large percentage of them be hermaphrodite I bought a 200
[03:59.720 --> 04:06.460]  pack our $200 pack of seeds and two out of the nine no three out of nine were
[04:06.460 --> 04:14.260]  showing that they're hermaphrodite in in veg still so pre flower sexing so
[04:14.260 --> 04:21.500]  that's that's always fun did you did you mention where you got the seeds from you
[04:21.500 --> 04:28.420]  know I'll say it I got a calculator their calculator genetics so I'm super
[04:28.420 --> 04:33.420]  bummed I was really excited it was a the waiting game which is a fruity pebbles
[04:33.900 --> 04:39.900]  crossed with a map one and yeah sure enough I'm I'm sexing them and I'm like
[04:39.900 --> 04:45.500]  that looks a little funky and I get my scope out and yep so now I'm gonna turn
[04:45.500 --> 04:49.700]  them into turn turn them into fertilizer for the rest of my plants and make
[04:49.700 --> 04:54.300]  something out of them yeah Johnny don't feel too bad you're not the only one out
[04:54.300 --> 04:59.660]  there that's this this is happening to I had a friend who planted his whole
[04:59.660 --> 05:05.140]  greenhouse with these auto flowers and they just all hermaphrodite it on him
[05:05.140 --> 05:12.380]  every last single one of them so yeah no we that's one of the then one of the big
[05:12.380 --> 05:16.700]  fears about the industry is that you know people are gonna get start doing
[05:16.700 --> 05:21.220]  things and selling things and they don't really know what they're doing and
[05:21.220 --> 05:25.340]  haven't back crossed and back crossed and back crossed because it takes you
[05:25.340 --> 05:29.740]  years to do you know it's not a simple process but they're just busting out
[05:29.740 --> 05:39.420]  these f1 f2 hybrid speeds with no with no backing on them they don't grow them
[05:39.420 --> 05:45.580]  out they just make seeds so it's crazy what's going on man but don't feel bad
[05:45.580 --> 05:57.700]  you're not the only one man rolling in a moment I do have an awesome question
[05:57.700 --> 06:01.780]  that actually relates to really well that we're gonna jump into dr. Anubis
[06:01.780 --> 06:08.100]  hello okay now Evian I've been calling you Evian for a while and I want to make
[06:08.100 --> 06:11.980]  sure that I have your name absolutely correct I'm saying it because it is an
[06:11.980 --> 06:18.040]  interesting spelling you're right on London it's pronounced Evian yes thank
[06:18.040 --> 06:23.780]  you for asking I appreciate that because 90 I'd say 95% of the time people get it
[06:23.780 --> 06:28.380]  incorrect but I'm not and you can call me Evie too I'm fine with my friends
[06:28.380 --> 06:35.660]  calling me Evie or Ev is fine and yeah Johnny I feel you as well I just want to
[06:35.660 --> 06:41.020]  say that you know it's it's kind of a tale as old as time I guess and I think
[06:41.020 --> 06:44.980]  that more recently in the past few years I've seen it seemed like it was starting
[06:44.980 --> 06:50.500]  to get a little bit better within the industry with seeds being more stabilized
[06:50.500 --> 06:55.180]  but I feel like there's been this kind of rush for these new new hypo genetics
[06:55.180 --> 07:00.100]  and people just really not doing the work to stabilize things and just
[07:00.100 --> 07:03.820]  releasing things more quickly and it's definitely you know it's a major issue
[07:03.820 --> 07:08.660]  it's been going on for a long time but I noticed it a lot we just did a big trial
[07:08.660 --> 07:17.100]  with a bunch of selection trying to find the so many of the new hypo genetics
[07:17.100 --> 07:21.180]  they're just like you breed on them wrong and they're me so I feel you and as far as
[07:21.180 --> 07:26.180]  autoflowers that's kind of like a very old issue with it's a different style of breeding
[07:26.180 --> 07:31.220]  generally with autoflowers and that her main trait has kind of just been something that
[07:31.220 --> 07:37.780]  happens there's I forget the exact science on it my brain isn't totally there today but there is
[07:37.780 --> 07:43.860]  it's been an issue and it's an issue with the breeding and somebody recently just did a we
[07:43.860 --> 07:48.660]  basically figured out a way one of the universities crispered out the thing so it's
[07:48.660 --> 07:53.700]  gonna change the future of the game with autoflowers but it you know that's every
[07:53.700 --> 08:00.140]  single autoflower genetic I pretty much it's just it's how much it comes out you know I guess it's
[08:00.140 --> 08:08.870]  really the issue but yeah it's nice to be here with you guys it's hard to stabilize something
[08:08.990 --> 08:16.910]  you can't work with for generations right the the autoflower you can kind of breed the other parts
[08:16.910 --> 08:22.550]  of the plant but kind of once you introduce that autoflower and you hit a certain kind of point
[08:22.550 --> 08:29.790]  it's just got to go out and so it's hard to get that consistency and it's good to hear that they
[08:29.790 --> 08:37.990]  have come up with a solution I don't know if I'm happy with that solution but it's it's interesting
[08:38.110 --> 08:50.670]  and I think there's also some space for non-pollinatable species as well right to allow
[08:50.670 --> 08:55.070]  folks to grow things outside that can't be pollinated so you don't have to worry about
[08:55.070 --> 09:02.030]  drift and other issues so you can grow multiple types of cultivars next to each other and have
[09:02.030 --> 09:08.830]  the hemp field next door it's not necessarily worry about the the plants being impacted so I
[09:08.830 --> 09:13.870]  think that's that's would be an interesting direction as well and I know there's some
[09:13.870 --> 09:21.670]  folks working towards that yeah the triploids are definitely a thing on that front but it's
[09:21.670 --> 09:27.790]  also that issue is that you need to go back to the person that you procured the seeds from in
[09:27.790 --> 09:33.070]  order to keep growing those same genetics so that doesn't necessarily always seem like the most
[09:33.070 --> 09:39.110]  sustainable solution to me but I do think it's interesting and exciting and I this past year was
[09:39.110 --> 09:44.430]  the first year I had grown intentionally with triploids and it was interesting because the
[09:44.430 --> 09:49.230]  seedlings definitely looked different than all of the other all of the other seedlings in the
[09:49.230 --> 09:53.510]  nursery so I thought that was kind of interesting as well they do have like a unique little
[09:53.510 --> 10:00.190]  personality but yeah also the idea there is that potentially they can have higher yields which I
[10:00.190 --> 10:07.070]  have not yet to see the proof in the pudding there but we'll see so that actually brings us
[10:07.070 --> 10:11.470]  right into the first question I had for the day that I think would be really interesting to talk
[10:11.470 --> 10:18.150]  about is is plant sex and and the first question I have which was asked in one of my Facebook groups
[10:18.150 --> 10:25.510]  can I increase the amount of female to male ratio in my plants through like temps they were told
[10:25.630 --> 10:34.310]  that you know they got too hot during the early part of the plant development and that the that
[10:34.310 --> 10:40.470]  that's why they have more male plants or maleness or Hermes showing I don't know much more detail
[10:40.470 --> 10:45.550]  than that so when exactly is the plant sex decided so I thought this would be a great
[10:45.550 --> 10:54.190]  opportunity Anna for you to like chat about that and and let us know. Well the sex of the plant
[10:54.350 --> 11:01.150]  is determined as soon as the seed is formed it either has two X chromosomes or it has an X and
[11:01.150 --> 11:10.750]  a Y chromosome but the hermaphrodite trait is carried in a females so all of your hermaphrodite
[11:10.750 --> 11:18.950]  plants are going to be XX so they're genetically female but the trait to Herm I don't think is
[11:18.950 --> 11:27.950]  located on the sex chromosome and it's controlled by lots of different genes including the genes for
[11:27.950 --> 11:33.950]  hormones hormone receptors things like that so you know and that's why when you have some nice
[11:33.950 --> 11:40.350]  seeds you have a small percentage of quote-unquote male plants that show up they're not male they're
[11:40.350 --> 11:48.230]  they're still genetically female but some gene in the in the genome is broken or is turned off
[11:48.230 --> 11:55.310]  or whatever so the the plant will grow into what you would expect a male plant to look like and
[11:55.310 --> 12:06.230]  you know the tendency to hermaphrodite is generally you know you can do it with chemicals obviously
[12:06.230 --> 12:13.350]  which which which change the hormone change the hormones in the plant and can produce male flower
[12:13.350 --> 12:21.310]  or you know male like structures you know pollen producing structures or it can happen through
[12:21.310 --> 12:28.670]  stress and the level of stress and that particular plant is it depends on it depends on the plant on
[12:28.670 --> 12:34.830]  how much stress that plant can take before it will show those hermaphroditic tendencies some
[12:34.830 --> 12:43.670]  plants can take a lot of stress and some plants just can't so it's not going to be the same you
[12:43.670 --> 12:48.710]  know for every plant so if you have a bunch of different plants and they all get too hot or they
[12:48.710 --> 12:54.710]  all get you know have a light leak or something like that they're not all going to produce male
[12:54.710 --> 13:00.190]  pollen structures but there's definitely the potential for one or some of them to produce
[13:00.310 --> 13:09.310]  those structures with that induced stress. Yeah I will chime in there too thanks Dr. Anna for
[13:09.310 --> 13:16.470]  breaking it down so so neatly there I will say that when we're doing pollen donors we never we
[13:16.470 --> 13:20.990]  don't classify those the same in the breeding world as hermaphrodites it's like a totally
[13:20.990 --> 13:25.470]  different thing that you're doing intentionally and I know that people who said in the past like
[13:25.470 --> 13:33.390]  you're trying to stress the plant to create male pollen but it's viewed differently and the plant
[13:33.390 --> 13:40.270]  can express those traits and I mean I've seen over the years so many different ways that a plant will
[13:40.830 --> 13:50.750]  express hermaphroditic tendencies and I did a whole course on on sexing plants and pollen
[13:50.750 --> 13:56.590]  production and it's such an in-depth topic and a lot of this stuff is hard to research and I think
[13:56.590 --> 14:01.550]  that you know so you start to see it over the years because there's also like rotalization
[14:01.550 --> 14:09.390]  and there's there's so many different ways that a plant can express that trait and all the way
[14:09.390 --> 14:13.710]  across the board so like what you were saying Anna too which is very even if you have I forget the
[14:13.710 --> 14:22.350]  math but it's like even if your plant is 99.9% you know or 99% feminized you're still going to end
[14:22.350 --> 14:28.270]  up with these male flowers that are actually genetically female and it's true and it can get
[14:28.270 --> 14:35.710]  to the point where it's like you're having like only one per 4,000 but that plant can still create
[14:35.710 --> 14:42.750]  pollen and destroy your crop I personally as far as your exact question the question in the group
[14:42.750 --> 14:49.470]  I have never really seen you can stress plants a myriad of ways and there's jokes among the grower
[14:49.470 --> 14:54.670]  community that like we're all pros at stressing out plants because you know it just it happens
[14:54.670 --> 15:00.270]  no matter what you do I really think that as far as like what Johnny what you were talking about
[15:00.830 --> 15:08.110]  previously the the the genome sex tests are great I think the genomic sex testing is wonderful it's
[15:08.110 --> 15:12.270]  a great way especially when you're in large-scale production and you're trying out a genetic like
[15:12.270 --> 15:19.310]  that you can start to test genetically to see if your plants are like literally male or female
[15:19.310 --> 15:26.830]  very very very early on but I think that the best test and they're expensive it's not it's not cheap
[15:26.830 --> 15:32.110]  to go ahead and do those sort of tests but they're widely available and there's quite a few companies
[15:32.110 --> 15:37.390]  that offer them at this point and if you're you know looking to not lose space in your production
[15:37.390 --> 15:41.470]  or even in your home garden it's worthwhile to just go ahead and do that because then you know
[15:41.470 --> 15:47.950]  that you're you're just creating more space but I have never seen and I've seen heat stress cause
[15:47.950 --> 15:55.630]  other issues in plants especially early on when they're seedlings but I think that as far as
[15:55.630 --> 16:01.310]  that creating your plants it's it's generally a weak genetics are going to show some sort of
[16:01.310 --> 16:08.350]  hermaphrodite traits and it can show it in so many different ways you could have plants showing
[16:09.230 --> 16:16.030]  I have lots of photos that there's along the stem you can start to see male flowers and female
[16:16.030 --> 16:24.590]  flowers in the pre-flower state and that is like an early sign of hermaphroditism but then also
[16:24.590 --> 16:31.070]  you can have later on when your plants are almost completely and there's jokes in the community about
[16:31.070 --> 16:36.350]  that you know your flowers almost finished and then you're starting to see little bananas pop
[16:36.670 --> 16:41.870]  and some people believe that those little male flowers that come out at the very end
[16:41.870 --> 16:46.590]  have sterile pollen but I've seen quite the opposite and I've never actually seen that
[16:46.590 --> 16:53.550]  proven in with science that that it's actually sterile pollen because you do see seeds come
[16:53.550 --> 16:58.350]  across and there are jokes that it's like the females are just frustrated and that they're
[16:58.350 --> 17:03.230]  like wait we want to we want to complete our life cycle so you know that there's that one plant
[17:03.230 --> 17:07.470]  that's like I'm going to help you all complete your life cycle and so it's going to flip and
[17:08.350 --> 17:13.150]  start to produce male flowers but they look very very different so when you're feminizing
[17:14.270 --> 17:22.190]  a pollen donor for making feminized seeds those flowers on the plant or it's also it's incredibly
[17:22.190 --> 17:27.470]  beautiful if you haven't ever seen it but when you're feminizing a plant it looks very much
[17:27.470 --> 17:34.350]  different to a plant that just popped like some sort of weird hermey thing and pre-flower or in
[17:34.350 --> 17:40.110]  finished flower it's got a bunch of different looks I guess is my point so I don't know
[17:40.110 --> 17:44.990]  exactly how that would express express genetically but you're seeing a ton of different things and
[17:45.950 --> 17:52.110]  stress is definitely an issue humidity can cause hermaphroditism late in flower as well
[17:52.110 --> 17:56.510]  and there's like a thousand things I think that can do it but I don't specifically think that
[17:56.510 --> 18:03.390]  heat in seedling phase is gonna is gonna really impact that greatly not from my experience and I
[18:03.390 --> 18:10.270]  have a lot of experience with that I just want to follow up with what you just said at the end
[18:11.230 --> 18:20.110]  that those manas those bananas that pop out either through stress or towards the end of the
[18:20.110 --> 18:25.550]  plant's life it's my understanding that the pop so those are just naked
[18:25.550 --> 18:31.390]  stamens and so they don't actually have the flower around it and it's my understanding that that
[18:31.390 --> 18:37.070]  pollen is much stickier and it doesn't travel very far and the whole point of those is so the plant
[18:37.070 --> 18:43.150]  can pollinate itself and make a seed set for the next generation it doesn't make very many and the
[18:43.150 --> 18:49.470]  pollen isn't isn't designed to get you know travel very far like like the wind like the
[18:49.470 --> 18:55.550]  pollen that is you know produced in a in a male flower structure that is designed to carry
[18:56.350 --> 19:02.350]  through wind so that's that's what the plant is doing it's just trying to make a seed so it has
[19:02.350 --> 19:10.030]  one more go at passing on its genetics to another generation that's a really interesting point and I
[19:10.030 --> 19:15.070]  will say that you know unfortunately from my experience and from you know just being around
[19:15.070 --> 19:20.990]  a lot of like larger scale commercial gardens is that I wish that were the case that it's just
[19:20.990 --> 19:27.310]  going to pollinate itself but with I've seen on like very large scale field production I've seen
[19:27.310 --> 19:33.150]  that and in green greenhouse production where it does in fact end up pollinating and causing seed
[19:33.150 --> 19:38.270]  production across the board so you know it's I think we're still getting clear there's some
[19:38.270 --> 19:42.990]  cool papers that have been written about this but it's more like when you actually see what happens
[19:43.710 --> 19:48.590]  in real time that it gets to be a little bit concerning and I'm going to try to look up I
[19:48.590 --> 19:57.310]  have some photos and close-up macro photos I took a while back and you can actually see just just how
[19:57.310 --> 20:03.710]  much pollen is coming off of those like the flowers and the bananas in the flower phase I'll
[20:03.710 --> 20:12.990]  see if I can find that in like PTR. Awesome love it thanks. Yeah and you know I've had
[20:15.390 --> 20:23.390]  a breeder specifically tell me that you know don't use heat mats when popping seeds because it's
[20:23.390 --> 20:29.070]  going to get you you know it's going to cause you to get more males I don't agree with I never
[20:29.070 --> 20:33.390]  agreed with the statement but I do agree that you shouldn't necessarily be using heat mats
[20:33.390 --> 20:38.830]  unless those mats are temperature controlled a lot of those heat mats are just they get too hot
[20:39.710 --> 20:43.710]  and it's bad for the plants early on which might also be causing some of that herming so
[20:44.430 --> 20:50.190]  heat mats is a pretty common seed starter technique but you do have to be careful and
[20:50.190 --> 20:54.110]  make sure that you have one of the temperature controlled heat starters so you can you're not
[20:54.110 --> 21:01.550]  overheating that root zone on those early plants so yeah no I've definitely had some breeders tell
[21:01.550 --> 21:07.950]  me and one specifically tell me that you know you're going to get more males if you when you
[21:07.950 --> 21:14.670]  use a heat pad and I've always felt that you know and I'm glad that you confirmed it but
[21:15.870 --> 21:22.430]  my observation has always been that it's a seed thing right just like you know the the just like
[21:22.430 --> 21:30.030]  innate just like with humans right the male and female is decided at conception it's not something
[21:30.110 --> 21:37.070]  that comes later after the child is born you know it's not like oh well if you have cesarean it's
[21:37.070 --> 21:46.750]  going to be a female right it's it's you know it's decided at you know at conception when that
[21:46.750 --> 21:53.710]  when that nuclei is formed and the egg and the sperm get together so for me that was how I
[21:53.710 --> 22:00.590]  envisioned that egg as that ovum you know that that egg is going to already have a direction
[22:00.590 --> 22:06.750]  that it wants to go and you know sometimes they're not necessarily going to be fully one way or the
[22:06.750 --> 22:15.070]  other sometimes they're going to come up in the middle I love how it's there's always this kind of
[22:15.070 --> 22:21.470]  you know rainbow as it were but there's always this cross relation to like being a human and
[22:21.470 --> 22:26.590]  being a cannabis plant I just I think that's why we we love it so much so while we're moving
[22:26.590 --> 22:32.030]  towards the subject and we're on it we had actually you know what I want to get this question because
[22:32.030 --> 22:35.310]  donk had one last time and we missed it so I want to make sure we jump into this and I'm
[22:35.310 --> 22:40.350]  going to direct this one over to Johnny and then I'm gonna I got another one following that flame
[22:40.350 --> 22:48.190]  if you're around I'll hit you up next if I met so Johnny if I miss HEC my guess is donk if you're
[22:48.190 --> 22:53.310]  in the chat right now let me know which exactly you mean by HEC but I assume the because the way
[22:53.310 --> 23:01.390]  you ask questions those are clay pellets if I if I mix in HEC into my soil when I build it
[23:01.390 --> 23:07.390]  will the microbes be able to mine the clay for nutrients I think that might be if Johnny would
[23:07.390 --> 23:13.630]  like to jump and have a question there maybe I'm throwing you into the best you know yeah I'm not
[23:13.630 --> 23:22.030]  familiar aec the only EC that I'm personally familiar with would be the electrical conductivity
[23:22.030 --> 23:28.030]  and I don't it doesn't sound like that he's he's referring to that so I think he's referring to
[23:28.030 --> 23:34.750]  like like clay pellets like lecca or or hydroton like hydroton okay so can you can you ask the
[23:34.750 --> 23:45.790]  question one more time so his question is if I add hydroton to the medium will eventually
[23:46.590 --> 23:57.310]  the microbes be able to mine it for nutrients um you know it would be in a I would say like it's
[23:57.310 --> 24:02.590]  it's possible but it's highly unlikely that you'll get that kind of action going on from
[24:02.590 --> 24:10.590]  microbial activity in a like an indoor grow um you know outside and long-term succession like
[24:10.590 --> 24:15.950]  you know the field being propagated for a long time and having lots of biology yeah I would say
[24:15.950 --> 24:21.870]  that could eventually break down um but I'm not exactly sure I mean it would take a substantial
[24:21.870 --> 24:31.870]  amount of time um would be my guess but it's just that I guess so maybe uh Jason Jason has a little
[24:31.870 --> 24:42.510]  bit of input on this one go for the older guy in the room to ask if clay breaks I apologize I'm
[24:42.510 --> 24:49.870]  sorry I was looking at something else and I missed the question do you think uh like lecca or clay
[24:49.870 --> 24:54.670]  hydroton will break down over time like microbes will be able to mine it for nutrients over next
[24:54.670 --> 25:02.350]  you know a longer period of time when setting setting up a bed well so I mean when you're
[25:02.350 --> 25:08.510]  mixing your soil soil is sand silt and clay right and you need to mix things in appropriate
[25:09.710 --> 25:17.950]  ratios uh to make sure that you get a good drainage and flow of both water and microbial
[25:17.950 --> 25:28.750]  biology through the soil and down and different types of substrates at different size will break
[25:28.750 --> 25:38.670]  down at different rates so um you know things that will take longer amounts of time um are not
[25:38.670 --> 25:43.070]  necessarily something you want to look to if you're doing raised beds or pots or something like
[25:43.070 --> 25:50.750]  that or you're trying to necessarily um neutrify a space I think if you're making it you know
[25:50.750 --> 25:57.710]  putting that as an input into a longer term area maybe putting it into furrowed rows or something
[25:57.710 --> 26:06.240]  along those lines you might get better benefit hopefully that would help I think that's a pretty
[26:06.240 --> 26:11.040]  dense thing to get in there and like you'll be talking about years for something like that to
[26:11.040 --> 26:17.040]  break down um over time so I'm going to just do a quick reset here because we're at about half an
[26:17.040 --> 26:20.640]  hour and we'll let people know what's going on if you are in the chat on future cannabis project if
[26:20.640 --> 26:26.000]  you are in the room down here we are future cannabis project ask the cannabis nerds where
[26:26.000 --> 26:31.600]  you get to come up ask your question and and get the answers from the cannabis from the cannabis
[26:31.600 --> 26:36.640]  nerds themselves a future cannabis project uh so we have an amazing group of panelists and we're
[26:36.640 --> 26:41.200]  looking for questions we want to answer yours so don't be afraid to type them in in the chat now
[26:41.200 --> 26:46.800]  or or raise your hand come up on stage if you have a cannabis question be it big or small we may or
[26:46.800 --> 26:51.600]  may not know the answer but we're gonna damn well try and give it a good go and at least find out
[26:51.600 --> 26:57.280]  where we can get the answer um and dig a little bit deeper so I always like exploring subjects
[26:57.280 --> 27:02.480]  that we might not know everything about so it's fun if you got some challenge you bring it up um
[27:02.480 --> 27:07.760]  but yes I don't want to miss out on anybody's there so if you do have a question type it into
[27:07.760 --> 27:12.880]  chat now I have another question that we'll roll into no slave if you're available I'd love to ask
[27:12.880 --> 27:17.680]  because you're you're a breeder you're probably you're you've got to be popping a lot of seeds
[27:17.680 --> 27:24.080]  so my question the a recent question was asked what is the ideal temperature and methods for
[27:24.080 --> 27:34.640]  popping seeds um be it clay uh be it jiffy or um jiffy sorry it jiffy pods or rockwool
[27:40.680 --> 27:43.960]  hey give me a couple minutes and I'll jump in sorry about that
[27:43.960 --> 27:50.770]  no problem do you want to jump in there have you I don't personally like either actually
[27:51.730 --> 28:00.210]  neither do I those are my least favorites I'm with Jason I mean I mean so my experience is
[28:00.210 --> 28:09.570]  more like at scale in greenhouses and I definitely try to have my seeds like right around 75 77
[28:10.210 --> 28:19.810]  to 80 ish depending um somewhere between 70 70 and 80 generally but I'm popping a few seeds
[28:19.810 --> 28:25.810]  you know unless it's for a small scale project uh generally are very large like I mean our
[28:25.810 --> 28:32.210]  machine can do like 80,000 a day so I'm doing them in like propagation houses and um it really
[28:32.210 --> 28:41.010]  depends those are my two least favorite ways I'm way more all about uh like propagation mixes and
[28:41.730 --> 28:47.410]  I'm a huge fan of like bio 365's uh seed starting mix and they formulated a special
[28:47.410 --> 28:56.610]  a special mix for us so I'm a big fan of um of planting into actual soil in 72
[28:57.810 --> 29:03.090]  72 you know cell trays is is generally my favorite when I'm working with seeds
[29:03.810 --> 29:09.330]  so uh yeah that's that's me and I and I have personally like when I'm doing it on a smaller
[29:09.330 --> 29:16.210]  scale I will use heat mats especially if I know that the uh if I know that and if breeder is
[29:16.210 --> 29:20.210]  telling you not to use heat mats I would definitely or like not to use the bottom heat
[29:20.210 --> 29:26.930]  on your trays I would definitely question um their breeding practices so like I said I think it's the
[29:26.930 --> 29:32.050]  temperature control piece of it because some of those heat mats do uh get a little bit too hot
[29:32.050 --> 29:36.850]  um totally they'll fry your stuff if you're yeah exactly exactly so you definitely want to get one
[29:36.850 --> 29:43.010]  of the ones with the temperature control on it so a great follow-up question that came in with that
[29:43.010 --> 29:56.560]  and I think it's great is ppfd for seedlings what's your recommendations I usually keep it about
[29:57.840 --> 30:07.120]  200 or so um which is about with the lights that I'm using in particular it's about I think 12
[30:07.120 --> 30:15.760]  inches away from the the small little clone uh kind of uh shop lights that I'm using um but yeah
[30:15.760 --> 30:21.520]  I wouldn't go any more than 300 really until they start to you know actually uh get a few sets of
[30:21.520 --> 30:36.790]  true leaves awesome I am digging into some other fun questions here uh give me a moment where is it
[30:36.790 --> 30:42.310]  popping seeds all right there's an awesome one I think this is very interesting because it'll be a
[30:42.310 --> 30:47.510]  very big because I don't know if you've done this yet Jason I think you mentioned it but didn't that
[30:47.510 --> 30:52.710]  you wouldn't have done it yet and that you're exploring the area so I've I had a recent question
[30:52.710 --> 30:58.630]  asked about labs you know lactic acid bacteria and using them as the foliar spray so you they've
[30:58.630 --> 31:04.950]  completed the full uh usual knf of labs and they're interested in foliar spraying their plants
[31:05.670 --> 31:09.510]  what would be the most appropriate process of doing that I'm gonna go
[31:10.230 --> 31:20.570]  Johnny do you want to start it off yeah sure um so lactic acid bacteria it's a great thing to have
[31:20.570 --> 31:28.170]  around a great tool to have in the garden um as far as um defending against pathogens kind of
[31:28.170 --> 31:36.410]  eliminating some pathogens and also um nutrient cycling but as far as a foliar with labs um
[31:36.970 --> 31:43.850]  it's something that I'll typically include in my regimen up until the second or third week of flower
[31:44.410 --> 31:52.330]  um just kind of inoculating the phyllosphere um and you know the common dosage that's used is one
[31:52.330 --> 31:59.690]  to a thousand so one milliliter per per liter um however I have found that in emergencies
[32:00.170 --> 32:06.730]  um that you can pretty much apply this stuff um foliarly at a really high concentration not have
[32:06.730 --> 32:14.570]  to to be worried about it I've used as high as um a couple ounces per gallon and had no ill effects
[32:14.570 --> 32:28.000]  and kind of um halted any any pathogen that I presence that I was observing uh yeah I mean he
[32:28.000 --> 32:36.160]  pretty much nailed it I do um and and then you know after after that first week or two of flower
[32:36.160 --> 32:42.320]  and I don't foliar a lot but I do foliar occasionally and I do include labs uh when I do
[32:42.320 --> 32:48.080]  foliar as I've said before and it's something I continue to work on I need to foliar more
[32:49.600 --> 32:55.440]  I just don't like doing it um but I do need to do more foliar applications it's just something that
[32:56.240 --> 33:02.400]  needs to be part of the regiment it's extremely beneficial for uh indoor plants and and that I
[33:02.400 --> 33:06.720]  think outdoors they're getting a lot of the benefits natural rain and other things it's
[33:06.720 --> 33:13.760]  you just don't get inside so um definitely outdoor foliar uh applications is extremely beneficial as
[33:13.760 --> 33:21.280]  well uh the dosage ratio is exactly what I'm using about one to a thousand and um
[33:22.160 --> 33:28.320]  I'm applying it then but I keep using it in uh root trench uh it's very it's very helpful as a
[33:28.320 --> 33:34.640]  retrench as well and especially for the nutrient cycling and getting some of those helpful
[33:34.640 --> 33:42.400]  beneficial uh bacteria into the soil where they're helping with breakdown and decomposition and things
[33:43.280 --> 33:53.520]  like that and I would like to add one more thing um just as a as a cautionary um disclaimer so
[33:54.160 --> 34:00.560]  I'm not sure and I would love I would love to see some future research on this as far as actual
[34:00.560 --> 34:08.480]  cannabis production goes but lactic acid bacteria has been said to have an effect on ripe fruit
[34:08.480 --> 34:15.440]  where it will decrease the sweetness of your fruit if you are applying it um too late into a
[34:15.440 --> 34:23.040]  plant's growth cycle um where essentially the lactic acid bacteria are um siphoning sugars away
[34:23.040 --> 34:32.560]  from the fruit and um you know this as far as I am I'm aware it is just kind of a um a personal
[34:32.560 --> 34:38.080]  experience that people have have found and seen with their food and antecedent kind of report
[34:38.240 --> 34:46.960]  and I'm wondering if the same thing transfers over into um terpene production and um just having how
[34:47.520 --> 34:57.280]  basically if lab has a negative effect on um cannabis's finished uh results and um quality
[34:57.280 --> 35:03.440]  so just a word of caution everybody if you're applying this stuff later on in flower that you
[35:03.600 --> 35:09.120]  have the unintended consequence of losing some sweetness or terpene production potentially
[35:09.680 --> 35:21.820]  on your plants that raises a whole bunch of questions in my mind because it you know I mean
[35:21.820 --> 35:27.580]  the beneficial bacteria need to eat something right like what exactly are they getting into I
[35:27.580 --> 35:32.700]  I don't know if if I can answer that or for anybody in the room can but might be a a good
[35:32.700 --> 35:38.220]  opportunity to bring in a microbiologist to dig into it a little bit because that would be really
[35:38.220 --> 35:43.740]  kind of fun to get into um do we want I got another really good question here or did anybody
[35:43.740 --> 35:52.280]  want to dump into that a little bit further no awesome uh before we get your question answered
[35:52.280 --> 35:57.640]  Jody thank you for coming up on stage I have the next question that has come down the pipeline
[35:57.640 --> 36:04.360]  when flipping to flower do you immediately flip to 12 12 or do you gradually change
[36:05.640 --> 36:10.920]  so I think this is like your ideal methods on flower changing so I'm going to jump down
[36:10.920 --> 36:17.160]  to Jason if you want to get it started uh what's your ideal method for flipping or changing into
[36:17.160 --> 36:25.640]  flower this would naturally be an indoor environment yeah so um I had for a little
[36:25.640 --> 36:32.120]  while played around with some transitions I do have um it's very easy for me to adjust my
[36:32.120 --> 36:37.880]  spectrum and my lights and I do program sunset and sunrise and you know a full red spectrum at
[36:37.880 --> 36:42.600]  the end of the day and things into my lights so I was playing around with some different schedules
[36:42.600 --> 36:49.400]  uh to do that transition but um I heard a whole conversation from Kevin Jodry talking about it
[36:49.400 --> 36:53.880]  where he basically was recommending really just to just go ahead and flip right to 12
[36:54.760 --> 37:02.920]  you're really just trying to get the maximum push for the most amount of days possible
[37:03.880 --> 37:11.720]  by slowly tapering down you're actually losing days that you could be maximizing that
[37:12.840 --> 37:20.600]  that potential and and so it's best to just flip right into 12 and go from there if you're running
[37:20.760 --> 37:29.080]  um if you're running uh you know a light gap uh they don't they again they're not gradually
[37:29.080 --> 37:35.560]  doing that they're pulling tarps uh right after that at that 12 hour mark and and in some cases
[37:35.560 --> 37:47.870]  obviously supplementing as needed so uh yeah right to 12. So there was a re like if you guys
[37:47.870 --> 37:51.790]  if anybody's seeing it on the future cannabis project and if not check it out because there
[37:51.790 --> 37:57.710]  was a re they recently did a point set a discussion about about light cycle and being
[37:57.710 --> 38:06.270]  able to increase um by by the plant being into flower and and having 13 hours of light that extra
[38:06.270 --> 38:11.710]  hour of energy if the plant doesn't flip or or have a problem where it switches back into
[38:11.710 --> 38:17.390]  vegetative state that if you go to like 11 13 and have 13 hours of light you'll be able to increase
[38:17.470 --> 38:22.350]  your lead yield because your plant has more thing now I don't know like I can't cooperate this I'm
[38:22.350 --> 38:26.590]  not I'm not 100 there but Evian you look like you wanted to to touch would you be able to touch on
[38:26.590 --> 38:53.050]  that a little bit you're on that you might be on my either nope but I think this is it leads to an
[38:53.050 --> 38:58.970]  interesting thing so if I I've heard this statement too about the the transition time and that getting
[38:58.970 --> 39:04.970]  the the plant into flower as fast as possible I've heard of people like turning off the lights for a
[39:04.970 --> 39:10.090]  couple days to try and decrease this thing I don't know how much viability do you know does
[39:10.090 --> 39:13.690]  anybody know if maybe there's a paper on this or anything around it we'll have to dig into it a
[39:13.690 --> 39:20.890]  little bit deeper but without any further ado Jody I know Johnny so I think that um what's really
[39:20.890 --> 39:29.450]  initiating the flowering is the the build up of uh I believe it's phytochrome far red um and that
[39:29.450 --> 39:37.850]  will build up as the lights are off and I believe there is a little bit of research backing that
[39:37.850 --> 39:45.930]  you will be able to kind of jump start flowering and kind of um have some play with the the
[39:45.930 --> 39:53.050]  chemicals that are produced the cytokinins I believe I don't quote me on that um but essentially
[39:53.130 --> 40:00.650]  I I've been extended dark period um allows for a buildup of this phytochrome far red and kind of
[40:00.650 --> 40:05.850]  jump starts the flowering process a little bit and I I've been told that it reduces
[40:06.410 --> 40:09.770]  stretch slightly as well if you give it that extended dark period
[40:12.010 --> 40:18.170]  hey Johnny this is Mitch oh go ahead oh yeah I was gonna say sorry London I was actually
[40:18.170 --> 40:22.570]  trying to cook something in my hands really I couldn't grab the phone and do the thing so my
[40:22.570 --> 40:27.050]  apologies but I feel like Johnny pretty much covered it I just wanted to add one little thing
[40:27.050 --> 40:34.410]  is that um the dark period is generally used when there's an issue so if you're having an issue
[40:34.970 --> 40:40.410]  in veg and then it's kind of getting close you can there's like hard resets where sometimes
[40:40.410 --> 40:48.490]  people will turn the lights off for um uh generally between 24 to 72 hours depending
[40:48.490 --> 40:54.570]  and that can kind of help the plants reset it is like there are risks obviously to doing that
[40:54.570 --> 40:58.810]  but if you're getting closer to flower generally I haven't ever seen a paper on it but it's kind
[40:58.810 --> 41:05.770]  of more of an anecdotal thing that like if you're dealing with issues um there is like a hard reset
[41:06.330 --> 41:10.810]  in between there and that's where I find it to be successful then I agree with most of the things
[41:10.810 --> 41:16.090]  Jason said I mean I think there's always like if there's issues as far as like timing and light
[41:16.090 --> 41:20.730]  cycles for all different things even in between flower it really just depends on kind of where
[41:20.730 --> 41:25.290]  you're at and what you're doing but there's a lot of different tactics and different people
[41:25.290 --> 41:29.530]  swear by different methods is is the other thing I think it's really just about figuring out what
[41:29.530 --> 41:38.630]  works for you yeah hey guys this is Mitch uh I heard it's some stuff so what I want to ask you
[41:38.630 --> 41:43.990]  about that hey Mitch just a second just a second Mitch I do Jody was up on stage before you so I
[41:43.990 --> 41:49.350]  do have to give him the floor first my friend so Jody uh if you want to go ahead thank you Mitch I
[41:49.350 --> 41:56.630]  appreciate you taking the moment uh Jody would you like to uh ask your question first no that was
[41:56.630 --> 42:00.950]  fine Mitchell that was cool that was no problem my question is sort of fitting around this a little
[42:00.950 --> 42:07.590]  bit it's in the veg so I'm I'm looking at a scenario where I would like to um change my veg
[42:07.590 --> 42:14.710]  lights instead of 6 p.m on I want to change it by 12 hours to 6 a.m on so I want to move forward on
[42:14.710 --> 42:22.070]  my increments from a 6 p.m on to a 6 a.m on what would be a safe way to do that like half an hour
[42:22.070 --> 42:26.870]  max increments or what's some suggestions or drawbacks I got to be cautious about
[42:27.350 --> 42:32.230]  I'd just leave them on and then flip them off when you want to let them go let them go the 24
[42:32.230 --> 42:37.430]  hours with the light and then change to change your cycle or the extra six hours or whatever it
[42:37.430 --> 42:42.550]  is I I wouldn't uh I would I would just leave them on until they hit the point where you want
[42:42.550 --> 42:47.510]  them to shut off and then just shut them off and then I agree with your new cycle definitely
[42:48.310 --> 42:59.290]  definitely so when they should have went off at noon and I just leave them on until 6 a.m
[42:59.290 --> 43:03.450]  because that's the new cycle instead of 6 p.m coming on I want them to come on at 6 a.m so
[43:03.450 --> 43:11.370]  instead of noon yeah on until 6 p.m yep yep the 36 hours or so of light isn't going to hurt them
[43:11.370 --> 43:15.930]  they'll be fine that's my band-aid right off
[43:19.210 --> 43:25.050]  make it quick see that answered your question Jody I'll add it to my notes thanks guys
[43:25.050 --> 43:30.570]  appreciate it awesome I've I've often been perplexed by this thought and I think the idea
[43:30.570 --> 43:35.770]  Jason's got it on play is kind of you want to pull it off like a band-aid and get it done quickly
[43:35.770 --> 43:41.690]  the the change will happen but if you do it slowly over an extended period of time you run
[43:41.690 --> 43:46.890]  into law extending the stress period or you just kind of want to get over Mitchell thank you so
[43:46.890 --> 43:52.730]  much for being patient what is your question for the day yeah I appreciate it thank you guys
[43:54.250 --> 44:01.050]  about what Johnny was mentioning on having the lights off and where it increases uh I think you
[44:01.050 --> 44:06.890]  said read something how does that work with the bro science and having the lights off uh you know
[44:06.890 --> 44:13.130]  the last few days before flower is that same thing occurring on that other uh end of the pole
[44:16.010 --> 44:20.090]  is there science that shows that having the lights off before you flower is there any benefit
[44:23.050 --> 44:29.690]  this is coming to me third hand possibly fourth hand but I've been told by a rather
[44:29.690 --> 44:37.450]  knowledgeable person who is a really a bro science uh hater and really tries to go and
[44:37.450 --> 44:43.690]  dispel things when she hears them but she said that there will be a potential increase in terpene
[44:43.690 --> 44:50.490]  production in that little bit of extra dark but it's minimal and that there was also a slight
[44:50.490 --> 44:56.810]  um reduction in the cannabinoids but you know there's so many variables coming into play there
[44:56.810 --> 45:01.930]  that it's really at this point in time I feel like the science is just getting started on
[45:01.930 --> 45:08.890]  questions like that um so I've been told that it's it yes it makes a difference but it's it's minimal
[45:10.330 --> 45:16.170]  yeah that's pretty much I agree with that I have done some at the end of flower I would go uh
[45:17.290 --> 45:23.770]  you know I'd play with two hours more like 12 14 in the last couple weeks maybe even more and I
[45:23.770 --> 45:27.690]  don't notice those last two weeks when you're flushing if it really makes a big difference but
[45:27.690 --> 45:31.850]  a lot of those things just seem like placebo effects like every time I'd have the lights out
[45:31.850 --> 45:36.090]  you know and then you finally you know how do you really know unless you were to do
[45:36.090 --> 45:41.130]  every single grow exactly nutrients and then test it and then maybe that way you
[45:41.130 --> 45:49.770]  could start to see if these bro sciences have any validity I've looked um through the literature for
[45:49.850 --> 45:55.290]  that exact question Mitchell and as far as I can tell nobody has done that study
[45:55.850 --> 45:59.770]  um as far as flushing goes there are now a few studies out there that have done
[46:00.410 --> 46:08.010]  uh flushing experiments and flushing doesn't seem to have really any significant impact on how much
[46:09.050 --> 46:11.850]  nutrients are left in the plant the nitrogen the potassium
[46:12.490 --> 46:18.090]  all that stuff and doesn't really have any impact on cannabinoids or terpene
[46:19.770 --> 46:28.250]  absolutely you're flushing your medium you're uh running a lot um it's not once something has been
[46:28.250 --> 46:33.770]  taken up by the plant and stored it in its cells it's not going to be flushed out by pouring water
[46:33.770 --> 46:39.770]  on the roots um although a lot of people just refer to the flushing as just when they don't use
[46:39.770 --> 46:44.410]  add any additional nutrients it's not really uh you're just keeping the you know you're
[46:44.410 --> 46:51.130]  continuing to water the plant you really uh part of that is medium based as well right uh if you're
[46:51.130 --> 46:57.530]  in soil you really are you can't flush all the nutrients out of soil it's pretty pretty impossible
[46:58.330 --> 47:08.330]  but you can uh push uh stuff you know new chemicals and salt buildups out of uh soil less mediums
[47:08.890 --> 47:16.010]  uh rockwool cocoa things like that will build up extra salts and things over time so you can
[47:16.010 --> 47:23.930]  flush them out of the medium so that the plant doesn't suffer some toxicity from that buildup
[47:23.930 --> 47:30.410]  but you're not really flushing anything from the plant itself during that cycle so
[47:31.290 --> 47:38.090]  so if i say i'm just real quick when you're saying that i'm thinking to myself well i i'll tell i'll
[47:38.090 --> 47:43.930]  test my runoff before i flush and so let's say it's at 2200 or whatever it is and then a week
[47:43.930 --> 47:49.930]  later it's half and then i'm a day before i want to cut and i'm at 60 is that a representation of
[47:49.930 --> 47:56.730]  flushing something out you're clearing out your medium you're not clearing out the plant itself
[47:56.730 --> 48:03.610]  though no right right okay yeah right because the number i think a point important point to note
[48:03.610 --> 48:08.170]  here is that there's also a common dual misconception is people think that like
[48:08.170 --> 48:13.850]  leaching and flushing are like similar in a way and for me the common term used is leaching is
[48:13.850 --> 48:18.650]  that is that point where jason was speaking about where you need to like fix or bring back a medium
[48:18.650 --> 48:25.690]  in which that has gotten toxic or had an issue and that these two words need to be a little bit
[48:25.690 --> 48:30.170]  separated so i'll be semantical here i'm going to say that's leaching and then the flushing part is
[48:30.170 --> 48:35.050]  when we refute when we don't put nutrients in now at the same time i've always kind of thought it
[48:35.050 --> 48:39.370]  is i mean if i don't need them at the end and i'm you know depending on what your system is it's
[48:39.370 --> 48:44.170]  actually kind of you know valuable to not spend money when you're growing plants sometimes so
[48:44.970 --> 48:49.130]  not having to spend that money now if you're in a bed or in a different situation i think it's all
[48:49.130 --> 48:53.930]  super super valuable but never winter popped up and i don't want to get too sidetracked and keep
[48:53.930 --> 48:57.930]  answering as many questions and welcome doc right at this stage i appreciate having you here i've
[48:57.930 --> 49:03.530]  thrown you a moderator badge because you're dope dope guy fucking awesome lineup on dagger by the
[49:03.530 --> 49:09.770]  way uh never winter i saw your question in the chat i'm really pumped that you came over to to
[49:09.770 --> 49:13.370]  ask it because i think it's a fucking awesome question and i'm gonna say anna's probably gonna
[49:13.370 --> 49:17.370]  want to jump in right off the bat but go ahead and ask your question never winter i did i did
[49:17.370 --> 49:20.810]  mute your mic when you came up on stage just because if there's too many mics open there
[49:20.810 --> 49:25.130]  becomes a little bit of a feedback issue so i apologize for doing that but thank you for being
[49:25.770 --> 49:33.770]  hey not a problem at all so i missed the session yesterday with the uh science was i think was
[49:33.770 --> 49:39.290]  focused on science in your grow yeah how to science your growth was the topic and i completely missed
[49:39.290 --> 49:45.050]  that and so as a person that does not come from a stem background what would you recommend as
[49:45.050 --> 49:52.970]  the best path to learn how to become a good citizen scientist i don't know if there's a book or podcast
[49:52.970 --> 49:58.810]  or youtube that kind of give a cursory overview and then you can start you know drilling in deeper
[49:58.810 --> 50:03.450]  as far as like you know recording what you need but what do you record how often you know how do
[50:03.450 --> 50:15.300]  you set up control groups all that jazz um i'm just trying to think of the best way to like word
[50:15.300 --> 50:21.540]  this um so everybody has the potential to be a scientist i mean there are the basic steps you
[50:21.540 --> 50:27.140]  come up with a question so what question are you trying to answer with with your experiment so
[50:28.020 --> 50:34.660]  and then how you go about answering that question is kind of um do you think about how are you going
[50:34.660 --> 50:43.220]  to go about answering that question so for example you know we just talked about flushing um so how
[50:43.220 --> 50:48.660]  would you go about testing whether or not flushing does anything to your plant if there's any
[50:49.380 --> 50:59.060]  advantage to doing it or not so you would have a control group um where you um you know didn't do
[50:59.060 --> 51:03.780]  any flush you just continued as normal and then you would have another set of plants where you would
[51:04.500 --> 51:11.140]  pull back the nutrients and just use water um and so you would need to take your data so you would
[51:11.140 --> 51:17.860]  need to write everything down record what you're doing as much as you can um even you know take
[51:17.860 --> 51:22.500]  pictures if you're not good at writing things down or videos or whatever and then you kind of
[51:22.500 --> 51:30.820]  have to take that data and then analyze it so you would need to have you know if we did the flushing
[51:30.820 --> 51:34.740]  thing you would need to you know maybe send it into a testing lab and look at you know the
[51:34.740 --> 51:40.660]  cannabinoids and terpene profiles of each set in your experiment to see if there's a difference
[51:40.660 --> 51:46.500]  between those and if you have the capabilities which most people at home would not uh be able
[51:46.500 --> 51:51.460]  to look at you know the the nutrient levels in the plants and compare those and see if they're
[51:51.460 --> 51:58.820]  any different you could also uh weigh your biomass and see if there's any difference in your yield
[51:59.380 --> 52:04.580]  um there's lots of things you can do it's but you know the first is boron i think that you need to
[52:04.580 --> 52:10.980]  come up with a question and you need to be it needs to be a question that you can uh answer
[52:10.980 --> 52:17.780]  through experimental methods so um does that kind of get it what you're asking
[52:20.260 --> 52:24.580]  it does it puts me on the right path so i can start to do some digging and
[52:24.580 --> 52:30.740]  if if anything come back and ask smarter questions so greatly appreciate it yeah no problem i mean
[52:31.380 --> 52:36.020]  yeah yeah oh i can i just add to the question because i feel like you'd be good for answering
[52:36.020 --> 52:40.660]  this um do you feel like it's kind of like when they're coming up with that question it's like
[52:40.660 --> 52:45.700]  your hypothesis essentially like so you're like this is my theory you know anecdotally this is my
[52:45.700 --> 52:52.020]  observation this is what i've been seeing and then you know this is uh you know i i usually like to
[52:52.020 --> 52:56.180]  think about it in those terms i'd be curious like what you think about just you know as far as the
[52:56.180 --> 53:05.140]  question being kind of like your hypothesis so i'm not a fan of um of making hypotheses just because
[53:05.780 --> 53:12.260]  that immediately introduces a bias into the question that you're asking so i am a fan of
[53:12.260 --> 53:21.060]  here is my question here are my aims so this is so we aim to determine if flushing has an effect
[53:21.060 --> 53:27.060]  so it's more like a statement instead of i have hypothesized that flushing will have an effect
[53:27.060 --> 53:33.860]  on the levels of i i have a hypothesis that flushing will increase the terpene content of
[53:33.860 --> 53:40.500]  my plant you've already got an idea of where you're you want to go and what your answer what
[53:40.500 --> 53:46.580]  you want your answer to be when you create a hypothesis so i find it better to create a neutral
[53:46.580 --> 53:54.180]  statement i am going to investigate um the impacts of flushing on cannabis um so that's that's how i
[53:54.180 --> 53:59.780]  do it and that's how i write all my papers and my experiments um i i see myself more as like an
[53:59.780 --> 54:06.660]  investigative investigative um scientist where i don't know the answer to the question that i'm
[54:06.660 --> 54:14.100]  asking or i just kind of throw it a ship and see what sticks to the wall um i but i i rarely know
[54:14.100 --> 54:26.900]  what the answer should be um and when i do have an idea uh i i um it's generally wrong actually
[54:26.980 --> 54:37.060]  so i let the data speak for itself you know i've also read and you know as a scientist and a
[54:37.060 --> 54:42.740]  published researcher it's also my job to read other people's manuscripts as they submit them
[54:42.740 --> 54:48.260]  and give them feedback on you know if they what they could have done differently and look at their
[54:48.260 --> 54:53.940]  you know conclusions and all that stuff and i have seen papers where they had hypotheses
[54:53.940 --> 55:00.020]  they collected the data they analyzed it and then their conclusions don't match what the data says
[55:00.020 --> 55:04.420]  but they do match their hypothesis and i'm like why would you do that you've got a great story
[55:04.420 --> 55:11.140]  just let the data speak for itself and report what it is you don't need to like be right um so anyway
[55:11.140 --> 55:17.060]  i'm that's a long-winded answer to say uh yeah i'm i'm much i'm i'm a big fan of the statements
[55:17.060 --> 55:22.260]  of what you're going to do not the hypothesis that you think you're going to have for the answers
[55:24.100 --> 55:28.660]  okay that's awesome yeah because science is observation and experimentation right
[55:29.300 --> 55:34.100]  um and you mentioned both of those words when you were talking which is fantastic and
[55:34.900 --> 55:37.620]  i think the other piece of that though is to understand
[55:38.980 --> 55:47.300]  uh to understand how you're going to measure your success or how you're going to measure the
[55:48.020 --> 55:54.740]  questions answers so what is the data or information you're going to collect
[55:55.940 --> 56:01.700]  to answer the question from what are the things you're going to be comparing
[56:02.740 --> 56:08.340]  to see whether or not your question you know which way your question goes
[56:09.300 --> 56:16.340]  so understanding what data you're collecting up front is also very helpful what are the things
[56:16.340 --> 56:25.540]  you're going to measure we call those kpis key performance indicators or metrics but understanding
[56:25.540 --> 56:31.620]  what you're comparing to answer the question is also important before you get going
[56:32.500 --> 56:44.160]  so that you don't lose the opportunity to collect that data i absolutely agree yeah it needs to be
[56:44.160 --> 56:50.160]  something that is measurable your question needs to include something that you can answer by
[56:50.160 --> 56:56.560]  measuring something and so this it's a lot you know you can think of it as like prepping like
[56:56.560 --> 57:00.880]  you have to do a lot of prepping before you can actually do the experiment if you just dive in
[57:00.880 --> 57:05.440]  and you've got plants growing already and then you're like oh i have this question and you kind
[57:05.440 --> 57:11.840]  of start in the middle like that doesn't work um you need to have all of this kind of thought out
[57:11.840 --> 57:15.680]  how you're going to do what your question is what observations you're going to make what data you're
[57:15.680 --> 57:21.040]  going to collect how you're going to get to your answer all figured out before you even start your
[57:21.040 --> 57:31.010]  experiment i i'm the worst experiment person ever in citizen science i'm just going to claim this
[57:31.010 --> 57:36.210]  now because one i'm really bad taking notes but the other thing is is i have way too many questions
[57:36.210 --> 57:43.250]  and i can never pick one so yeah i let other people give me questions and then i'll try and
[57:43.250 --> 57:50.050]  figure them out by asking others because i'm just yeah go ahead i'm the same way um which is why in
[57:50.050 --> 57:55.490]  grad school you have an advisor or a mentor or a principal investigator to hold you back and say
[57:56.050 --> 58:02.210]  you need to hold back and you can ask three things you can do three things no more than three things
[58:02.210 --> 58:07.570]  i'm always like but i have six things he's like no no three things pick pick which you want and
[58:07.570 --> 58:14.050]  and we'll do that so you need to um you have you have to make some choices you can't uh answer all
[58:14.050 --> 58:19.010]  the questions all at once and actually when you try to do that it'll just end up being very messy
[58:19.010 --> 58:27.720]  and you probably will have a really crap experiment hey this is mitch i think you guys will get a kick
[58:27.720 --> 58:32.680]  out of this because we and my cousin when we started growing some years back i remember when
[58:32.680 --> 58:41.160]  we were harvesting one time and he basically uh got a pot and boiled water and then when he
[58:41.720 --> 58:46.120]  cut the plant he didn't cut the plant he pulled it out of the soil where the root base was he shook
[58:46.120 --> 58:51.720]  all of its dirt off the root and i i shit you not he said i said bro what are you doing he says bro
[58:51.720 --> 58:58.280]  this is how you get more thc into the plant and granted it's already flowered and you know okay
[58:58.280 --> 59:02.440]  whatever our first crop and he and then when he puts it in the boiling water he's like look it's
[59:02.440 --> 59:08.920]  shaking i mean you had to be there to see this but it just goes to show you that when you talk
[59:08.920 --> 59:15.640]  about experimentation cannabis is one of many things out there that uh you know i'm not to
[59:15.640 --> 59:20.920]  say that that's a viable thing to do but people will do things that you know just to see what
[59:20.920 --> 59:26.600]  the outcome is so i thought that was pretty interesting yeah i'll add to just you know
[59:26.600 --> 59:32.680]  knowing because i'm the same like anna i feel like i always have like a thousand questions like
[59:32.680 --> 59:39.160]  i have so many questions and over the years um i definitely and and with what my the team that i
[59:39.160 --> 59:44.040]  work with we've had these questions because we've you know we've had observations and we also want
[59:44.040 --> 59:51.080]  to make things work and we've done lots of so a lot of the time instead of calling it uh science
[59:51.080 --> 59:55.080]  i just i'm like okay we're running a side by side you know like we're running this side by side and
[59:55.080 --> 59:58.600]  there's a control and there's the things and you're gonna we're gonna report the data because
[59:58.600 --> 01:00:06.920]  we're kind of data junkies anyway so the biggest issue i've had is you know growing and cultivation
[01:00:06.920 --> 01:00:10.600]  and breeding and nursery operations and all of these things even if you're a home grower it
[01:00:10.600 --> 01:00:16.600]  already is a lot and so if you're really going to set yourself up to do uh you know like kind of
[01:00:16.600 --> 01:00:20.520]  where the question was originally directed if you're going to set yourself up to do those things
[01:00:20.520 --> 01:00:24.760]  really making sure that you have the extra time and if you're a business making sure that you
[01:00:24.760 --> 01:00:31.080]  have the extra labor because you're adding you're adding something quite large and and you know when
[01:00:31.080 --> 01:00:37.560]  you already have a goal or a purpose of production it becomes it's just another thing and so i see a
[01:00:37.560 --> 01:00:42.200]  lot of like half finished experiments or it's you know not reporting the data correctly or any of
[01:00:42.200 --> 01:00:48.200]  those things and you know i think it's just good to be mindful that it's already a lot so i just
[01:00:48.200 --> 01:00:49.240]  want to throw that out there too
[01:00:49.240 --> 01:00:57.400]  and you have to be really careful in making sure that your plants are treated exactly the same
[01:00:57.400 --> 01:01:00.680]  except for that one thing that you're changing just one thing that you're changing
[01:01:02.920 --> 01:01:06.760]  and if you're in a facility make sure that everybody in the facility knows that you're
[01:01:06.760 --> 01:01:12.680]  doing an experiment or a side by side i can't tell you how many times that me and some of my
[01:01:12.680 --> 01:01:19.800]  co-workers have started something and then you know somebody moves the plant or it gets topped
[01:01:19.800 --> 01:01:26.920]  or it gets you know the same you know uh root drench the same nutrients as everything else
[01:01:26.920 --> 01:01:32.280]  and completely can throw off a side by side or experiment and sometimes you won't even have any
[01:01:32.280 --> 01:01:38.120]  idea that something's been done so it's a really good rule of thumb that everybody is on board with
[01:01:38.360 --> 01:01:44.280]  it because you can mess it up yourself it's easy enough to do but once you start getting you know
[01:01:44.280 --> 01:01:49.240]  10 20 people around it you know it's unlimited the amount of things that can happen to it
[01:01:50.440 --> 01:01:56.120]  that was your case in point johnny that's like exactly my point and so it happens all the time
[01:01:56.120 --> 01:02:01.720]  and also i will say too that the control is just so important when you're doing these things because
[01:02:01.720 --> 01:02:06.360]  you know we also we try new products all the time and then people want you to try a new product and
[01:02:06.920 --> 01:02:10.680]  you know you're like okay well sure i'll try your product but like you have to actually
[01:02:10.680 --> 01:02:16.280]  even have you have to really make sure that your control is actually a control so it's a little
[01:02:16.840 --> 01:02:23.720]  you know it sounds fun always and then it's uh also you know data collection just is adding
[01:02:23.720 --> 01:02:30.600]  more labor at the end of the day i think that's the most important note johnny man i've had a
[01:02:30.600 --> 01:02:36.120]  couple situations as a chef running larger kitchens like very large kitchens that you
[01:02:36.120 --> 01:02:41.320]  got a label and you got an email and you got to tell everybody what's going on because if you have
[01:02:41.320 --> 01:02:47.080]  you know a grand and meet done up in a certain way and somebody takes that and puts it out in
[01:02:47.080 --> 01:02:52.200]  the hallway and you know leaves it there for an extended period of time and you lose all of it
[01:02:52.200 --> 01:02:57.160]  that's that's on you that's your fault for not making sure that the communication was was round
[01:02:57.160 --> 01:03:02.600]  not on the person that did it so it does i think that's really super important especially for
[01:03:02.600 --> 01:03:08.360]  people that have facilities it's not people's problem it's lack of all that stock i just
[01:03:08.360 --> 01:03:12.920]  all that all those bones i was saving all that stock what are you doing
[01:03:15.080 --> 01:03:23.400]  no one does stuff out of malicious intent in my mind sops ladies and gentlemen sops logs
[01:03:23.400 --> 01:03:30.280]  and chalkboards in a commercial setting or dry erase boards outside your room eliminate 99% of
[01:03:30.280 --> 01:03:38.760]  that absolutely i like dry erase because i like stainless steel i can write on stainless steel
[01:03:38.760 --> 01:03:44.920]  with dry erase hey doc hope you're doing well it's great to see you uh so we do have an interesting
[01:03:44.920 --> 01:03:50.280]  question do you want to say hello oh buddy i just was laughing at all of it you know it's like some
[01:03:50.280 --> 01:03:56.600]  of my favorite cultivators and breeders are up on this panel right now the one on the other side of
[01:03:56.600 --> 01:04:01.240]  hoda man she's just like one of my favorite people in the world we've been back channeling and laughing
[01:04:01.240 --> 01:04:06.760]  a lot of this stuff going on so listening to everything it's like a lot of this when it comes
[01:04:06.760 --> 01:04:12.920]  down to it trial and error you know trial and error is what we did old school i've got literally
[01:04:12.920 --> 01:04:19.480]  50 years worth of college single ring binders you know those wire ring things that i keep years and
[01:04:19.480 --> 01:04:25.960]  years and years of journals on all my plants all my runs all my control groups so i can go back and
[01:04:25.960 --> 01:04:34.360]  data search all this stuff you know so old school you kept good notes you had an sop that was written
[01:04:34.360 --> 01:04:40.840]  all the team members were aware of that i've literally started like hoda you know he's the
[01:04:40.840 --> 01:04:46.440]  only one probably close to my age you know i started with a pencil in the room man and you
[01:04:46.520 --> 01:04:52.200]  wrote shit on the wall you know i literally you know we're doing this in this tray over here or i'm
[01:04:53.160 --> 01:04:58.040]  adjusted this here and i my team knew that if you walked in you looked at the wall because i had
[01:04:58.040 --> 01:05:03.880]  notes written on the wall you know and pencil and pen and marker so what and that's how i did it and
[01:05:03.880 --> 01:05:09.640]  then run and i moved with this commercial in the last 10 years now you know dry erase boards are
[01:05:09.640 --> 01:05:16.920]  outside every room we keep good notes we keep journals you know and or logs if you will a log
[01:05:16.920 --> 01:05:22.120]  of what's happening in every grow and every room's going on because there's so much complicated
[01:05:22.120 --> 01:05:27.800]  information being gathered right now the data that's so critical and in this application man
[01:05:27.800 --> 01:05:34.360]  when you're talking about multiple rooms running with multiple cultivars going on and yeah they're
[01:05:34.360 --> 01:05:41.080]  all running on 12 12 cycles which is not that hard of complicated but as the more you get involved
[01:05:41.080 --> 01:05:45.000]  in things like that you know i'm running different genetics in different rooms these require different
[01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:53.880]  feeding regimes each one of my rooms has a book each tray by genetics has its own assigned book
[01:05:53.880 --> 01:06:01.640]  as well so the technician can come in and walk into a room look outside the door and see where
[01:06:01.640 --> 01:06:07.960]  we are in the phase of the cycle of the growth cycle and then when they walk into the room by
[01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:13.880]  table section you know i have sliding tables in my rooms ladies and gentlemen so you can get
[01:06:13.880 --> 01:06:18.520]  it out and maximize the space allows the technician to get out both sides of the plant
[01:06:18.520 --> 01:06:23.560]  blah blah blah anyway each one of these tables at the end of each of these tables there is a
[01:06:23.560 --> 01:06:30.360]  journal there a log if you will that says what the hell's going on what the plants are if there's
[01:06:30.360 --> 01:06:34.920]  any feeding regime something happening specifically okay when it comes to testing man
[01:06:35.720 --> 01:06:43.400]  i have a test team it's me a couple other people we keep really really tight tight rules i lock a
[01:06:43.400 --> 01:06:48.600]  lot of doors you know i mean i try to keep people from fucking shit up lock the door you know again
[01:06:48.600 --> 01:06:54.440]  commercial application my two cents i'm gonna shut the hell up good to see everybody this evening
[01:06:54.440 --> 01:07:00.280]  welcome to 2022 ladies and gentlemen the year of craft cannabis brothers and sisters the year of
[01:07:00.280 --> 01:07:07.800]  craft cannabis mark my words that's awesome doc i love to hear it's nice to hear your voice and
[01:07:08.760 --> 01:07:13.800]  and i will just say on that note i feel like it really does it changes the game when you're really
[01:07:13.800 --> 01:07:18.040]  just tracking your data and doing your logs and you have your calendars and i think i've gotten
[01:07:18.040 --> 01:07:22.600]  to a place over the years where it's like i want it all and i want to be able to see it remotely
[01:07:22.600 --> 01:07:28.040]  so i make people do those things and then also like i think that just we have so much amazing
[01:07:28.040 --> 01:07:33.960]  technology so i feel like it's really changed the game for us over the past few years is also
[01:07:33.960 --> 01:07:41.240]  having that um so i can log into an app and i can see exactly what's going on and see exactly what
[01:07:41.240 --> 01:07:48.280]  the remote their apps look like remotely makes a huge difference uh to you know discuss practices
[01:07:48.840 --> 01:07:54.360]  and that way it's transparent to everybody also so i don't have to actually physically go and read
[01:07:54.360 --> 01:07:59.720]  the log i can see it so you know it's like i think it's backing up multiple different ways
[01:07:59.720 --> 01:08:05.560]  with information especially if you're changing things you're trying to experiment so it's uh
[01:08:05.560 --> 01:08:10.520]  yeah it's a different we're at a different place after all these years of like going from not
[01:08:10.520 --> 01:08:18.040]  keeping any records to keeping as many records as we possibly can so it's a it's fun i actually love
[01:08:18.040 --> 01:08:24.120]  it total total sharing those records man i'm sharing those records that's the part that's
[01:08:24.120 --> 01:08:30.280]  freaking me out man keeping those journals and hiding them in my stealth behind the scenes old
[01:08:30.280 --> 01:08:35.480]  school indoor man that was behind a wall and the hidden door that now i've opened up like
[01:08:35.480 --> 01:08:40.440]  seven years ago i opened that doorway up for the first time and friends that have been in my house
[01:08:40.440 --> 01:08:44.760]  for decades said good god man we didn't know you had this thing in your basement it's like you're
[01:08:44.760 --> 01:08:49.960]  not supposed to know it back then but taking those hidden journals sister as we both know you know
[01:08:49.960 --> 01:08:56.520]  and us sharing data with each other now and you know and why i'm such a fan of hers is the you
[01:08:56.520 --> 01:09:03.000]  know this data collection that we both work on together and with the different people that we
[01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:09.080]  work with this is a huge part of the genetic profiling that's happening right now of trying
[01:09:09.080 --> 01:09:14.280]  to put some we want to share this information ladies and gentlemen we've been we've been as
[01:09:14.280 --> 01:09:19.480]  you guys know we've been called outlaws and criminals up until like even now to today you
[01:09:19.480 --> 01:09:26.280]  know i can't believe that knucklehead mississippi said 3.5 grams is you know criminal it's just
[01:09:26.280 --> 01:09:33.560]  beyond words you know this is how silly this thing is it's like this is medical data collection this
[01:09:33.560 --> 01:09:38.840]  specific community the craft community is about the medicine of the plant we've been about the
[01:09:38.840 --> 01:09:45.480]  medicine of the plant before this hip modern era of cannabis cultivations happened we always were
[01:09:45.480 --> 01:09:51.320]  collecting data we just couldn't share it with one another and i'm so thankful to have you in my
[01:09:51.320 --> 01:09:59.320]  world ma'am now what a rock star you are you make it this old man happy to still be in this game so
[01:09:59.320 --> 01:10:06.680]  i just gotta tell you it's cool to see you in here y'all know who she is man y'all don't follow her
[01:10:06.680 --> 01:10:13.160]  follow her ladies and gentlemen okay this is a real warrior this is the woman i talked to when i asked
[01:10:13.160 --> 01:10:18.280]  can you tell me how to do 1 million to 2 million seed propagation successfully
[01:10:18.280 --> 01:10:24.600]  and someone tell me how to do that that's her i love him so much you know what i think that's
[01:10:25.480 --> 01:10:30.200]  i mean i'm sorry i'm gonna let you go but i just want to i want to say this is like it's it's
[01:10:30.200 --> 01:10:36.120]  so funny i when you do things in such large volume and you have those perfect systems and methods down
[01:10:36.200 --> 01:10:39.720]  to 2 million like you try and do 10 seeds it can be a fucking nightmare
[01:10:43.320 --> 01:10:46.920]  watch out for the mice that's all i gotta say just watch out for mice
[01:10:49.080 --> 01:10:54.040]  it's a fun thing but yeah i mean it's i you know i all started on that same level too and
[01:10:54.040 --> 01:10:59.000]  i love that this group is great because it's like we're all experimenting and learning together too
[01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:03.800]  so i see that there's so much potential and it's nice to have the science backing us at this point
[01:11:03.800 --> 01:11:09.320]  too because i think without that and then also that data sharing especially when you're breeding
[01:11:09.320 --> 01:11:13.960]  because i think doc before you came into the room at the beginning there was some questions about
[01:11:15.240 --> 01:11:20.360]  you know just breeders recommending like don't use heat you know if you want to fry your things
[01:11:20.360 --> 01:11:25.080]  or it can cause more males or the hermes and reality is like the more data collection that
[01:11:25.080 --> 01:11:30.760]  your breeders are doing then they can tell you you know like this is all of the information we have on
[01:11:30.760 --> 01:11:37.000]  this specific genetic and where it's gonna work well for you and what your feeding is going to be
[01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:41.080]  so i think that we're really getting to a place where we're going to be so much better at what we
[01:11:41.080 --> 01:11:47.000]  do because we can share information and data at that level and that starts with kind of recording
[01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:52.360]  it and utilizing the science so pretty exciting times i'm stoked that we all you know that we're
[01:11:52.360 --> 01:11:57.320]  together in this fun collaboration over competition i think at this point is where we're at
[01:11:57.960 --> 01:12:04.760]  i i love that there's an interesting point when i went i ran into the other day
[01:12:04.760 --> 01:12:11.640]  someone asked me what was the perfect temperature to to germinate seeds at and i thought well it's
[01:12:11.640 --> 01:12:17.560]  an interesting question because it's highly variable um and people and it's actually stated
[01:12:17.560 --> 01:12:23.880]  completely differently in a few different spaces so like as a form of example you know ed roden
[01:12:24.360 --> 01:12:31.080]  book off the top i might be off by one or two to one degree here but ed roden sol's book i believe
[01:12:31.080 --> 01:12:41.480]  is is 18 to 24 and then you have uh uh like the cannabis the the cannabis encyclopedia by jose
[01:12:41.480 --> 01:12:50.120]  cervantes and and i think he says 21 to to 30 degrees i'm sorry everybody i'm in celsius here
[01:12:50.120 --> 01:12:55.240]  my apologies um and and it's variable so you even have two like major people that we all looked up
[01:12:55.240 --> 01:13:00.120]  to in the community that have drastically different opinions and i don't necessarily think
[01:13:00.120 --> 01:13:05.400]  that it's like a very i think maybe it's a variant in in their experience of what they've been with
[01:13:05.400 --> 01:13:10.360]  they they've seen a lot of plants that were that that did well in this section but this this person
[01:13:10.360 --> 01:13:16.200]  was in this space and you know i just i wonder and and i look forward to these congruent points
[01:13:16.200 --> 01:13:21.320]  of us creating conversation and actually having a little bit more of a standardization about it
[01:13:21.320 --> 01:13:27.000]  um you were going to say something there doc i'm sorry if i interrupt oh buddy it's all right
[01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:32.040]  london man i just was just kind of laughing at the where this thing has moved and what you and
[01:13:32.040 --> 01:13:37.720]  what you said i was always in the frame of mind that it was around 78 degrees you know so
[01:13:38.600 --> 01:13:42.760]  i know that that there's a range in there that these things all start
[01:13:42.920 --> 01:13:47.880]  getting out you know they start turning a lie you know so that's this whole part of it and you guys
[01:13:47.880 --> 01:13:52.200]  get it man i didn't go to school over this shit i'm all self-taught i am the age of
[01:13:52.920 --> 01:13:57.720]  ed and jorge and matter of fact ed and jorge are buddies you know it's like
[01:13:58.920 --> 01:14:04.920]  we there weren't no damn books you know and i'm in fucking jorge's book for crying out loud you
[01:14:04.920 --> 01:14:09.160]  know it's like it just this is just part of what this journey is after decades and decades and
[01:14:09.240 --> 01:14:16.040]  decades at it what mitch brother what you with that science citizen scientist and what the kind
[01:14:16.040 --> 01:14:20.360]  of what this conversation there's so many good manuals out there that are a collection of some
[01:14:20.360 --> 01:14:26.200]  of the best minds in cannabis old school or hates book is an excellent reference that london
[01:14:26.200 --> 01:14:34.600]  mentioned and i give that book out regularly did new cultivators as a baseline reference guide to
[01:14:34.920 --> 01:14:39.800]  reference guide to give them some you know you don't always have to ask google or youtube man
[01:14:39.800 --> 01:14:45.800]  or you know your buddy that's been growing for five seconds longer than you have is that book
[01:14:45.800 --> 01:14:52.040]  specifically is not just a singular source book that's a collection of information that's been
[01:14:52.040 --> 01:14:59.400]  added to for literally 50 almost 50 years now well over 40 years now it came out in the late 70s it's
[01:14:59.480 --> 01:15:05.800]  been going for a long long time it was a collection of him gathering tips and tricks and information
[01:15:05.800 --> 01:15:11.400]  from the best of the best of the best in and around the triangle over and over in the netherlands
[01:15:11.400 --> 01:15:15.640]  around the world that's this group of men and women that have contributed a thing and it's
[01:15:15.640 --> 01:15:23.560]  refined every few years it's a really really good reference guide and a baseline reference guide for
[01:15:23.640 --> 01:15:29.880]  new home cultivators or just cannabis want to make yourself better at your game like i said
[01:15:29.880 --> 01:15:34.200]  i've been giving that book out to people for years and years and years cannot stress that
[01:15:34.200 --> 01:15:40.520]  one enough to have that in your library if you don't so anyway sorry london my two cents
[01:15:41.960 --> 01:15:47.400]  i love all that and i just want to say london on the you know the variance because i've germinated
[01:15:47.640 --> 01:15:54.520]  a lot of seeds over the past few years and um it's one of my it's like literally my favorite part
[01:15:54.520 --> 01:16:00.120]  so and i've seen you know i have all sorts of sops and things and what can go wrong and what can't go
[01:16:00.120 --> 01:16:07.000]  wrong and i will say too just on personal note is i also have like my sweet spots that i'm like i
[01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:13.800]  absolutely love germinating seeds when it is a little bit warmer and the temps and the when it's
[01:16:13.800 --> 01:16:19.800]  like the temps are actually higher there's like a certain time of year when i'm in especially in
[01:16:19.800 --> 01:16:26.600]  hoop houses that i just love germinating seeds because it happened i can have it happen within
[01:16:26.600 --> 01:16:31.640]  24 hours and so it's like you also got to watch what the seed likes and you know you can go back
[01:16:31.640 --> 01:16:36.360]  and forth and there's all sorts of tricks and tips to like making sure especially if you're in
[01:16:36.360 --> 01:16:41.000]  an indoor setting and you're usually using lights because you can really screw up your seedlings
[01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:45.480]  if you're going to make them stretch and there's all these things but i know my personal sweet spot
[01:16:45.480 --> 01:16:50.600]  and it's it's warmer than any of the recommendations because that's why i think it's funny and because
[01:16:50.600 --> 01:16:55.560]  it's like because i literally i just know there's this one moment i'm going to do seeds in this
[01:16:55.560 --> 01:17:00.680]  couple week window and the temps are way higher that i'm going to have like a 24 to 48 hour
[01:17:00.680 --> 01:17:07.080]  germination on those seeds and it's not ever recommended but it's uh they like it so there's
[01:17:07.080 --> 01:17:12.920]  that also i think there's an important note too is i think you can go too hot is is it's
[01:17:12.920 --> 01:17:18.520]  definitely better to be cooler than too hot because i think once you get to like 32 or 34
[01:17:18.520 --> 01:17:22.600]  you kind of end up cutting the oxygen out of the water don't you johnny go ahead you look like you
[01:17:22.600 --> 01:17:29.880]  want to jump so that's something i've noticed with uh propagating via clone um of course the hotter
[01:17:29.880 --> 01:17:36.680]  it is the faster it's going to take place uh the rooting process that is however uh the hotter it
[01:17:36.680 --> 01:17:44.200]  is the more of an open invitation for pathogens there is um so it's something that one time uh our
[01:17:44.840 --> 01:17:53.080]  exhaust fan got unplugged and the room the clone room was like 95 degrees and every single one
[01:17:53.080 --> 01:17:58.280]  and we only had a couple trays in the room but every single clone died except for one and that
[01:17:58.280 --> 01:18:05.160]  one clone rooted in like three days or something stupid fast where i was like wow like they really
[01:18:05.160 --> 01:18:10.920]  like didn't like it except for this one that just rooted and toughed it out and yeah so there's
[01:18:10.920 --> 01:18:16.600]  definitely a sweet spot and uh you know like i said the hotter it is the faster it's going to
[01:18:16.600 --> 01:18:21.400]  take place but then you have to think that the pathogens are also going to be multiplying
[01:18:21.400 --> 01:18:27.320]  and making themselves known at a faster rate as well yeah which i worry about less with seeds i
[01:18:27.320 --> 01:18:33.080]  will say too but um and i also have seen it where i've had clients come and be like hey we just had
[01:18:33.080 --> 01:18:38.280]  a major issue with our germination and you know you want to know if there's maybe something wrong
[01:18:38.280 --> 01:18:42.360]  with the different seeds or something and then you go to the facility and their rooms are like
[01:18:42.360 --> 01:18:46.760]  the where they're trying to germinate the seeds it's like over 100 degrees and so it's the same
[01:18:46.760 --> 01:18:52.920]  actually when you're breeding and you're um you're drying your seeds you definitely want to make sure
[01:18:52.920 --> 01:19:00.760]  that you're not letting the seeds ever get too hot because too hot will definitely way decrease your
[01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:07.800]  um the germination viability so you know it's it's all it's science and then it's also like
[01:19:07.800 --> 01:19:14.040]  playing with what works for you and while we're on the subject of temperatures i think it's really
[01:19:14.040 --> 01:19:17.880]  important that people make sure that their thermometers are correctly running because
[01:19:17.880 --> 01:19:23.800]  we're talking about a few degrees here and then if you're things off by 5 10 which which happens a
[01:19:23.800 --> 01:19:29.080]  lot um that's gonna seriously affect your judgment call so that's that's a great subject you're
[01:19:29.240 --> 01:19:33.720]  being a great citizen scientist and we talk about this all the time is checking your instruments
[01:19:34.680 --> 01:19:39.080]  and and making sure that they're as consistent as possible now jamal did come up to the stage
[01:19:39.080 --> 01:19:43.960]  and we want to give you the opportunity to ask questions jamal do you have one for our experts
[01:19:50.920 --> 01:20:05.710]  you are on me bottom right oh we lost him i was gonna say bottom right hand corner
[01:20:06.670 --> 01:20:11.470]  i just want to touch on what what we're talking about on the seat on the temperature thing too
[01:20:11.470 --> 01:20:16.110]  because there's also the shift once what we were talking about what you cleaned your seed you got
[01:20:16.110 --> 01:20:21.230]  them prepped and stuff now where we go like we're going in long-term storage man like like i have
[01:20:21.230 --> 01:20:27.470]  cold dry storage and i know that avian does that as well and i'm not sure if anybody else that works
[01:20:27.470 --> 01:20:32.110]  in that realm in here too but you know where we have long-term cold storage where we keep our
[01:20:33.070 --> 01:20:39.870]  storage where we keep our genetics chilled and for the long-term use so there's that aspect of
[01:20:39.870 --> 01:20:46.910]  it as well where you get into this science part and believe me man in 70 i was just
[01:20:46.910 --> 01:20:52.110]  wanting to see if i could even grow this plant to think i had to collect data and do a genetic
[01:20:52.110 --> 01:20:58.190]  library and all this other stuff now all these years later it's just trippy as all get out and
[01:20:58.190 --> 01:21:03.230]  they get to be in this room with you guys and talk about it's even funnier to me i mean i shake
[01:21:03.230 --> 01:21:10.110]  my head every day thinking we get to have this conversation in 2022 and clubhouse we can talk
[01:21:10.110 --> 01:21:19.310]  about the sacred tree of life and i look down and i see trucker and dr hernandez and don sitting down
[01:21:19.310 --> 01:21:24.030]  there and derrick hanging out and i see bogue hanging out in the bottom man and these are
[01:21:24.030 --> 01:21:30.430]  people that are all just pros at this man i love this this plant this game and look at that kelsey
[01:21:30.430 --> 01:21:38.030]  just popped in you know this is cannabis brothers and sisters in 2022 the year of craft cannabis my
[01:21:38.030 --> 01:21:44.590]  friends the year of craft cannabis we have to step up and make our voices heard brothers and sisters
[01:21:45.390 --> 01:21:51.070]  old man stepping out for a little bit of dinner thank you london maybe ancestor i'll talk to you
[01:21:51.070 --> 01:21:58.750]  soon ma'am we're getting ready for the breeders gathering spring of 2022 in northern mendocino
[01:21:58.750 --> 01:22:05.950]  ladies and gentlemen at a cool legacy farm they're going to host today and i'm kind of cool i get to
[01:22:05.950 --> 01:22:13.150]  tell this group first and foremost i get to invite my first journalist to this event and i'll be
[01:22:13.150 --> 01:22:20.030]  damned if it isn't the wall street fucking journal coming to this event to put it all on documented
[01:22:20.190 --> 01:22:23.950]  brothers and sisters have been doing this for 50 fucking years i cannot believe it
[01:22:24.590 --> 01:22:29.630]  wall street journal man i'm stunned by that one so gonna go eat my dinner now
[01:22:29.630 --> 01:22:33.710]  love y'all have a good night awesome to hear you doc
[01:22:36.270 --> 01:22:41.630]  awesome well thanks doc ray and you know what we're getting close to the end here
[01:22:41.630 --> 01:22:46.430]  we usually try and go about an hour and a half and i think we'll try and stick with that if
[01:22:46.430 --> 01:22:52.110]  anybody else in the audience maybe want to bring up a last question you're welcome to raise your
[01:22:52.110 --> 01:22:59.950]  hand now and let us know if you have a question if you have a question in the chat there you're
[01:22:59.950 --> 01:23:04.990]  welcome to go ahead and drop that one i do have an interesting question that was come up and i
[01:23:04.990 --> 01:23:10.350]  i hope i have it well memorized because the chat went a little wonky there for a bit and
[01:23:10.350 --> 01:23:13.790]  unfortunately i missed it missed a couple questions because just the sheer volume
[01:23:14.190 --> 01:23:20.830]  um but the question was about vitamin b1 and using it as a primer to prevent stress in the
[01:23:20.830 --> 01:23:25.390]  cloning state um and and then for that matter i have a follow-up because we were talking a little
[01:23:25.390 --> 01:23:33.110]  bit about cloning has anybody experimented with this uh on the panel here go for it evie
[01:23:35.110 --> 01:23:41.510]  i'm a huge fan of um just b vitamins in general for the plants but the science uh i will say
[01:23:42.470 --> 01:23:49.190]  is kind of as far as i know i would be curious if johnny or dr anna or london has any um
[01:23:49.910 --> 01:23:57.910]  up-to-date science but i have also been told that it's more anecdotal so i find observationally that
[01:23:57.910 --> 01:24:06.150]  the plants really love it um but i also feel like it's not 100 backed up by science so i'm all for
[01:24:06.150 --> 01:24:10.870]  it i think that the plants the you know to me the proof is in the pudding the plants seem to love it
[01:24:10.870 --> 01:24:16.310]  and i think it works really well and i've had good success with it so uh i guess i would leave
[01:24:16.310 --> 01:24:21.190]  it there i don't know if there's more specifics on the question london but um i would just say yes
[01:24:21.830 --> 01:24:30.600]  i'm a fan but i don't know if there's any science to back it up yeah i'm not 100 sure on that one
[01:24:30.600 --> 01:24:36.120]  but i wanted to pose an idea and kind of a theory that we actually had a canon book club a little
[01:24:36.120 --> 01:24:41.560]  while ago that really dug into uh cloning and propagation and and one thing that i've noticed
[01:24:41.560 --> 01:24:48.200]  too just like johnny is and everybody else in this space is that the the temperature of the
[01:24:48.200 --> 01:24:53.800]  the plant when taking a clone is great greatly affects the rate of of root development the the
[01:24:53.800 --> 01:25:00.040]  rate of you know movement of energy into a space where you can develop roots um but it also
[01:25:00.040 --> 01:25:05.960]  increases the rate of mold and other product problems i've i've wondered and theorized if
[01:25:05.960 --> 01:25:14.040]  you could you know theoretically decrease the physical air temperature of the space and to you
[01:25:14.040 --> 01:25:20.280]  know like 17 to minimize i mean that's that's going to be like two degrees lower than um
[01:25:21.160 --> 01:25:27.400]  than powder powdery mildew's ideal temperature for spawning so you would you would probably be
[01:25:27.400 --> 01:25:33.800]  able to you know not have as much mold um the plant would develop a little bit slower um but
[01:25:33.800 --> 01:25:39.240]  would if you keep that base point that you're developing the root on um warmer that would be
[01:25:39.240 --> 01:25:42.840]  kind of transpiration point do you guys think i have any validity here to explore
[01:25:43.640 --> 01:25:49.000]  as being a citizen scientist should this be my first should this be our first test anna
[01:25:52.950 --> 01:26:00.790]  uh i have no idea honestly i i don't even did we do a paper on cloning i don't even remember that
[01:26:00.790 --> 01:26:10.840]  i am zoning out i don't know in london i don't know well it's a bit of food for thought there i
[01:26:10.840 --> 01:26:19.000]  think um i am going to call it for today uh we do have lots of questions so if you'd like to
[01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:24.520]  submit some questions don't be afraid to uh check out dagadot academy in the description where you
[01:26:24.520 --> 01:26:29.640]  can sign up and submit questions you can also show up here every week on wednesday at four o'clock
[01:26:29.960 --> 01:26:36.760]  you can also submit questions live in chat or live over there whatever gets you the question
[01:26:36.760 --> 01:26:41.320]  uh gets us the question so we can get you the answer uh we'll look at trying to do some
[01:26:41.320 --> 01:26:46.440]  spotlight segments we'll bring in some interesting guests thank you very much my team of uh experts
[01:26:46.440 --> 01:26:50.680]  to be there if you're in the audience make sure to say follow the club and follow the moderators
[01:26:50.680 --> 01:26:54.760]  push those little bells to do that i'll leave that open the room open for a second and if you've stuck
[01:26:54.760 --> 01:26:59.320]  around in the club or you're new here go ahead and follow everybody around you too because they're
[01:26:59.320 --> 01:27:15.720]  gonna they're gonna help populate and and grow your thank you hello hello everybody hope you are
[01:27:15.720 --> 01:27:24.200]  all doing very well oh let's see because i usually never have audio oh my god can you hear me can you
[01:27:24.200 --> 01:27:29.560]  uh can you guys hear me at all you know we should talk and dig into ph because i think that's it
[01:27:29.560 --> 01:27:34.360]  that's a fun little sector there was a couple questions i missed there about ph um that we
[01:27:34.360 --> 01:27:40.280]  will have to touch on next time now if you uh have it like i said in the in the show you're
[01:27:40.280 --> 01:27:47.160]  welcome to come on by and and ask your question there submit them onto our site um say hello and
[01:27:47.160 --> 01:27:53.800]  yes i do i do see all that there i've invited uh the boss to shoot me a message in backchat on
[01:27:53.800 --> 01:27:59.240]  instagram and we'll have a discussion and probably see what we could do um clearly this is providing
[01:27:59.240 --> 01:28:04.440]  a lot of entertainment that's we talked so much about it um regardless moving forward because we
[01:28:04.440 --> 01:28:10.840]  do have a very fun episode of fire is fire starting in three minutes where you can catch the boys
[01:28:10.840 --> 01:28:16.040]  chad talking about the dankest of fire that's on our channel too so don't miss out on that one don't
[01:28:16.040 --> 01:28:20.680]  go anywhere you know what just just stay there don't if you gotta go bathroom go to bathroom
[01:28:20.680 --> 01:28:26.200]  but don't go far like push refresh you need to push refresh in about three minutes you can do
[01:28:26.280 --> 01:28:33.160]  that you know what i i think it's best cheddar i missed you today very very sad that you weren't
[01:28:33.160 --> 01:28:39.320]  here um but i look forward to you know what actually a controversial point of view if anybody's
[01:28:39.320 --> 01:28:47.960]  checked out the mr grow it he had um what was his name a lighting expert on and they discussed um
