[00:02.490 --> 00:11.610]  And back in our life's future cannabis project channel here with Brian and Marco on another lovely Wednesday
[00:12.330 --> 00:19.110]  They've got a wonderful guest. I'm gonna be quiet. I'll let them talk about it. Thanks guys, and thanks for joining everybody in chat
[00:19.970 --> 00:22.830]  Yeah, good morning living soil nerds. Happy Wednesday to you
[00:23.170 --> 00:29.030]  We kind of have a you know a big brain episode on this one shout out to Brandon
[00:29.310 --> 00:34.150]  When we were first doing this with Peter he was one of the first guests that we've had on the show
[00:34.150 --> 00:37.390]  I believe we had Steensland and then you on the show and
[00:38.270 --> 00:46.390]  Fortunate enough man. You were given some gold nuggets throughout that interview and it's it's you know from a from a cannabis information thing
[00:46.390 --> 00:48.830]  It's it's shot off in the YouTube algorithm
[00:48.830 --> 00:53.310]  So just really appreciative of the of the time that you give the community Brandon
[00:53.310 --> 00:56.750]  I know you go out of your way you put a lot of posts and stuff about education
[00:56.950 --> 01:02.190]  That's why even in the summer I reached out to to you Brandon as well as Marco you both were
[01:02.870 --> 01:06.770]  You know the the co main event speakers and you know
[01:06.770 --> 01:08.710]  You're both there for a reason in my opinion
[01:08.710 --> 01:14.910]  You guys just have a lot of information to give and it's not regurgitated information that I've heard a hundred times that you just kind
[01:14.910 --> 01:21.990]  Of you know sprinkled your own little stuff on these are you know out-of-box thinking or you're finding other ways to work with peers
[01:22.430 --> 01:27.630]  And that's just something that I've admired the entire time that I've gone through this little transition and stuff
[01:27.630 --> 01:31.310]  Which is really understanding what it takes to build a living soil system
[01:31.310 --> 01:38.150]  It is daunting for the newer viewer and you two gentlemen are definitely at the top of the the upper echelon of being able to
[01:38.150 --> 01:44.190]  Give the community what they need so that they can try this on their own and then kind of move forward and hopefully
[01:44.670 --> 01:48.350]  You know, we're gonna inspire others to eventually get to the commercial side of things
[01:48.470 --> 01:51.910]  I know Brandon you had a you know, I don't even know
[01:51.910 --> 01:56.690]  It might have been like four years now or five years you were you know, you had some misfortunes in your life
[01:56.790 --> 01:59.550]  You were able to educate yourself on a whole nother level
[01:59.550 --> 02:06.190]  You had some time to think about things in life and what's important and you have put put the pedal to the metal my friend
[02:06.190 --> 02:11.630]  I mean you've kind of it just if I guess it is like about five years and about like five years or so
[02:12.670 --> 02:16.470]  Yeah, yeah, cuz I did I made a five-year plan while I was locked up
[02:17.070 --> 02:22.770]  Because I was look at I was sitting in there I wasn't thinking oh, I'm fucking locked up. I'm not gonna grow weed anymore
[02:22.770 --> 02:25.510]  I was thinking I got to figure out a way to fucking go bigger
[02:25.510 --> 02:31.190]  I got to figure out a way to like fucking make this shit work, right? I wasn't like oh
[02:31.790 --> 02:35.430]  You know, but okay. I wasn't feeling bad for myself. No, I just made a plan
[02:35.430 --> 02:37.430]  I implemented the things that I had already
[02:38.110 --> 02:40.350]  Learned about as far as like, you know
[02:41.350 --> 02:48.430]  Manifesting your reality and and so I started manifesting it by writing it out first right now. I actually got out
[02:49.270 --> 02:51.750]  November 6 2018 so
[02:53.030 --> 02:54.510]  Just over three years
[02:54.510 --> 02:58.470]  I'm a little over halfway through my five-year plan and
[02:58.790 --> 03:02.790]  everything that I wrote down and wrote down and over and over and over and
[03:03.430 --> 03:05.430]  It's all coming to fruition
[03:06.510 --> 03:09.230]  Good deal, man. That's way that's very powerful brother
[03:09.830 --> 03:15.710]  One thing I like about about you since we're talking is um, you know respect as a grower man
[03:15.710 --> 03:18.670]  Like the care you take with your plants as obvious
[03:19.190 --> 03:22.830]  But then the amount of time that you dig into your soil, you know
[03:22.830 --> 03:28.550]  Get deeper into that and then not only that man. You take the time to share all this stuff like
[03:28.990 --> 03:35.590]  Like people don't understand like your little rants you've been doing I call them little but they're huge like those rants man are pretty awesome
[03:35.590 --> 03:39.830]  I've been archiving those and what they are folks. If y'all aren't following Brandon
[03:40.270 --> 03:44.190]  He'll just walk around his grow and he'll do a rant like say on calcium
[03:44.190 --> 03:44.750]  You know what?
[03:44.750 --> 03:49.750]  I mean and the cool thing about those is those save you a ton of time because yeah
[03:49.750 --> 03:53.910]  You could easily go Google if you haven't having an agronomy class or anything like that
[03:53.910 --> 03:58.430]  You can Google and start reading about what these things are, but he's cutting right to the chase
[03:58.430 --> 04:02.670]  He's telling you how they pertain to the specific plants that we all grow, you know
[04:02.670 --> 04:08.190]  So I want to say I appreciate those ranch you've been doing Brian. I got my notepad ready and just
[04:08.950 --> 04:12.790]  Let's just get it going. You can take it. However, you want direction you won't go bro
[04:13.590 --> 04:21.150]  Yeah, so let me first start off by introducing myself to any new listeners people who aren't familiar with either the show or myself
[04:21.910 --> 04:24.470]  My name is Brandon rust. I have been
[04:25.150 --> 04:28.510]  cultivating cannabis for a little over 20 years now
[04:29.030 --> 04:35.750]  I started when I was about 18 or 19. I was I think it was 19 when I started back in
[04:37.350 --> 04:39.350]  2000 in late 2001 or early
[04:39.670 --> 04:45.870]  2002 and I worked out in San Diego with you know, the guys that created the Afghani bull rider and
[04:46.510 --> 04:50.550]  You know work with the p91 guys all those people did some, you know
[04:51.270 --> 04:56.510]  Prison terms and shit, but I've been growing for for a long time, right? I've been growing over half my life
[04:57.030 --> 04:58.630]  And
[04:58.630 --> 05:00.630]  I had an opportunity to come out to Oklahoma
[05:01.870 --> 05:03.870]  Got my start out here started building
[05:04.550 --> 05:07.950]  and started doing like cannabis at scale and
[05:09.270 --> 05:11.590]  figured out how to dial that in just
[05:12.270 --> 05:14.270]  like people would
[05:15.110 --> 05:21.190]  For an agronomic crop like corn or soy or wheat, you know, they collect data. They look at the soil. They look at the numbers
[05:21.710 --> 05:23.710]  the
[05:23.710 --> 05:25.710]  The numbers for like what tissue
[05:26.070 --> 05:33.150]  Should look like how much percentage of nitrogen potassium phosphorus all those things. They all already exist even for hemp
[05:33.470 --> 05:39.630]  So we're just looking at those levels and trying to achieve those levels seeing if those levels are even accurate or if we should be
[05:39.630 --> 05:41.990]  Able to push them further. That's what I'm doing
[05:43.310 --> 05:46.270]  Let's see. I also own Bokashi earthworks and
[05:47.030 --> 05:48.870]  That's my company. I
[05:48.870 --> 05:50.710]  sell fertilizer
[05:50.830 --> 05:52.830]  amendments and microbes
[05:53.710 --> 05:55.710]  I also
[05:56.190 --> 06:00.670]  You know grow I got a facility I'm working on some huge projects with
[06:01.550 --> 06:07.470]  NASA agritech and some other companies out here in Oklahoma. I work with the largest cultivation
[06:08.030 --> 06:10.030]  facility out in Hawaii
[06:10.550 --> 06:16.470]  So I'm all over the place. I do a lot of agronomic data collection and analytics to maintain
[06:17.230 --> 06:20.550]  Sufficiency and balance for these living soil systems
[06:21.950 --> 06:25.270]  Okay, so I mean I'm kind of
[06:26.470 --> 06:31.070]  I'm not exactly sure what your guys is. Well, you guys want to talk about today?
[06:31.710 --> 06:33.150]  What do you guys want to get into?
[06:33.150 --> 06:39.630]  What's kind of something that's been on your guys's mind because I know that there's different levels to this. There's be beginning intermediate
[06:40.270 --> 06:46.670]  Advanced stages and I often sometimes forget that I have to go all the way back to the very very basics
[06:46.990 --> 06:50.550]  to help, you know the new people that are just coming online and
[06:51.310 --> 06:55.470]  Experimenting so that they can take the guesswork out of out of these things, you know
[06:55.470 --> 06:58.150]  So well, I had a question I thought about you know
[06:58.150 --> 07:04.030]  I wanted to because of what you said because you can't go so deep man and a lot of people that um have reached out
[07:04.030 --> 07:05.870]  If they're not that deep, you know
[07:06.870 --> 07:09.870]  We want to start off shallow then we can dive on in
[07:10.430 --> 07:15.310]  One thing I wanted to ask you is okay knowing what you know now, right and you haven't always
[07:15.990 --> 07:21.550]  Obviously been into testing your soil then amending it and kind of your process you're doing now
[07:21.910 --> 07:29.430]  So take yourself back kind of before you were doing that testing and then kind of talk us through like as you know
[07:29.430 --> 07:34.310]  Starting off with just a small a home grower, you know, like if you're not gonna test every time
[07:34.350 --> 07:41.190]  What are some surefire ways or some ways that you would kind of approach, you know starting a grow even and then kind of?
[07:41.910 --> 07:46.030]  Amendments and then working on from there or do you think you know testing is 100%?
[07:46.030 --> 07:48.790]  You kind of should have did that way back then and you wish you would have
[07:49.550 --> 07:54.670]  man, if I would have known about the methodologies employed by
[07:55.630 --> 07:57.990]  you know conventional agriculture and
[07:58.990 --> 08:01.950]  in other horticulture and botany
[08:02.670 --> 08:04.670]  You know industries I
[08:05.870 --> 08:07.870]  Would have been I probably would have been
[08:08.670 --> 08:10.670]  You know in a whole different place
[08:10.990 --> 08:12.830]  You know
[08:12.830 --> 08:14.830]  It's it's like this
[08:16.630 --> 08:19.990]  When you get a when you buy a bottle nutrient or
[08:20.670 --> 08:25.990]  Even a dry powdered nutrients that's been formulated already, you know for the most part
[08:26.350 --> 08:32.310]  You know, they have like they've done testing and stuff on the products and they could say hey this is this you could use this
[08:32.310 --> 08:34.310]  Just like this and you should get this result
[08:35.390 --> 08:36.870]  but unless
[08:36.870 --> 08:40.990]  And but if you veer from that recipe or it's just like baking, right?
[08:40.990 --> 08:48.270]  So you follow most people follow recipe and some people can follow recipes better than other people, right? Like I
[08:49.030 --> 08:54.390]  My chili isn't gonna come out the same as my ladies chili
[08:54.430 --> 08:58.310]  Even if we're following the same recipe, it's just different, you know
[08:58.310 --> 09:00.550]  It might have the same ingredients for a while
[09:00.550 --> 09:04.790]  but for whatever reason and you've seen that right you've seen that with
[09:05.310 --> 09:13.550]  You know if you ever had a family recipe and your auntie makes them cookies and then your mom or grandma makes those cookies
[09:14.310 --> 09:20.070]  There's like what's what's the secret in there? Right? And so everybody wants to know what that secret is and the secret is
[09:20.070 --> 09:27.470]  And the secret is that the people that are making these formulations are usually certified agronomists that actually understand
[09:28.630 --> 09:33.590]  The data behind that and if they don't they're taking they're just you know, taking the best guess
[09:34.750 --> 09:36.750]  if you really want to see
[09:38.670 --> 09:40.030]  True
[09:40.030 --> 09:45.870]  Health right because my goal is always to meet the maximum genetic potential of a plant
[09:45.990 --> 09:53.870]  Potential of a plant, you know turn on all the good genes turn off all the things that are aren't gonna be use useful
[09:54.950 --> 09:58.550]  or you know in quite, you know, try to have
[09:59.590 --> 10:01.230]  you know your
[10:01.230 --> 10:05.790]  your resistant genes, whatever they may be and
[10:07.030 --> 10:12.950]  The my approach now is is through nutrition and what I was doing before was I was growing
[10:13.710 --> 10:18.030]  Fantastic fucking weed back in the day. I did it for a really fucking long time
[10:18.030 --> 10:21.430]  I mean, that's what got me into the position that I I'm in
[10:21.950 --> 10:28.630]  But it was because I was really really good at reading deficiency symptoms and being able to address those right
[10:28.950 --> 10:34.790]  so you can read a plant and you can get really really good at reading a plant and understanding if something is
[10:35.390 --> 10:38.870]  You know nutritional symptom if it's an insect
[10:38.870 --> 10:45.430]  It's a symptom of insect damage, you know, because there are things that could be correlated or looked I mean not correlated
[10:45.430 --> 10:47.430]  There are things that could look the same
[10:47.630 --> 10:52.770]  But are uncorrelated right for instance root aphid damage
[10:53.290 --> 10:59.590]  Can look like the starts of nutrient deficiencies, right? You'll see, you know, the bottom we are to go yellow
[10:59.590 --> 11:01.590]  You'll see some things start happening
[11:02.590 --> 11:06.470]  And it is a product of you know, the plant not being able to process
[11:07.310 --> 11:12.590]  The mineral nutrition from the soil because the root hairs are being damaged because being fed on right
[11:12.770 --> 11:18.510]  So being able to I was really really already really good at that, right so I could address something
[11:19.190 --> 11:20.270]  and
[11:20.270 --> 11:22.270]  Keep it kind of going right?
[11:22.670 --> 11:28.830]  But what I do now, I never get I should never be getting to that point where I see deficiency symptom
[11:28.830 --> 11:34.550]  And the reason is because if you're collecting agronomic data, you never get to a point
[11:35.550 --> 11:38.950]  Where you're efficient in any type of
[11:39.630 --> 11:42.390]  nutrient nutrient, right and
[11:43.230 --> 11:45.150]  so
[11:45.150 --> 11:51.030]  There are things that you can do like the soil and saturated paste test make sure that you have balance and sufficiency
[11:51.470 --> 11:55.790]  Across the board in these soil systems that meet the targets for
[11:56.390 --> 11:58.790]  For cannabis right now
[11:58.870 --> 12:03.470]  You can go even further and you can take and test the plant itself doing tissue and sap
[12:03.750 --> 12:10.550]  Analysis and what that's gonna allow you to do is see the tissue is gonna allow you to see a total percentage of
[12:11.110 --> 12:13.110]  nutrient that's total
[12:13.310 --> 12:20.670]  Available unavailable. It's just as a total percentage. What is making it into the plant tissue, right? And so
[12:21.390 --> 12:26.110]  You know, I like to see around five to five and a half percent calcium
[12:26.270 --> 12:28.790]  And that's really hard to get
[12:29.710 --> 12:35.150]  Unless you have the right parameters typically, you know, you're not you don't see those high levels
[12:36.390 --> 12:40.590]  So there's a list of all those nutrients that should be in a certain percentage
[12:40.590 --> 12:42.270]  and then the micronutrients will be listed as
[12:42.270 --> 12:47.950]  PPM when you're reading the data and if you read and if you have these targets and you're meeting these targets and you know
[12:47.950 --> 12:52.950]  You're going to have a healthy crop, you know, you're gonna have a really healthy crop, right?
[12:52.950 --> 12:54.950]  And if you can dial those in perfectly
[12:55.550 --> 13:00.430]  Then you can you can even dial in the again you're dialing in the
[13:01.110 --> 13:04.350]  nutritional potential for these plants and every plant has a
[13:05.270 --> 13:07.270]  slightly different
[13:07.790 --> 13:13.030]  Nutritional requirements. Let's take mac one right now the mac one that I'm growing people say hey, man
[13:13.030 --> 13:16.630]  This stuff grows really slow goes really slow and it's like what is
[13:17.910 --> 13:21.310]  Why is that right and it's by testing the tissue
[13:21.310 --> 13:24.790]  Testing the tissue testing the soil you're keeping these targets
[13:25.430 --> 13:31.770]  And if something is happening like oh, it's still not absorbing calcium when all the requirements and targets were met
[13:32.670 --> 13:36.930]  Then you'll know. Okay. I need to push calcium on this plant or maybe you need to push nitrogen
[13:36.930 --> 13:42.870]  I'm not at that point right now because I haven't started testing on it. I have the variety and I'm running it and
[13:44.030 --> 13:49.670]  You can see that in different varieties, right? You can go even a step further and you can do what's called SAP analysis
[13:50.150 --> 13:54.990]  SAP analysis shows you a total combination of
[13:57.590 --> 13:59.230]  Nutrition
[13:59.230 --> 14:01.670]  mobile nutrition immobile nutrition
[14:02.350 --> 14:04.110]  the pH of
[14:04.110 --> 14:08.030]  The leaf and then the sugar content or bricks levels
[14:08.990 --> 14:10.550]  Okay
[14:10.550 --> 14:12.550]  now
[14:13.550 --> 14:20.710]  What what this does is because you're getting fully photosynthetic plants from the bottom plant and fully photosynthetic
[14:21.430 --> 14:22.630]  photosynthetic
[14:22.630 --> 14:24.430]  leaves from the top of the plant
[14:24.430 --> 14:31.150]  They test both and it gives you an idea of how them the nutrients are actually being mobilized
[14:31.390 --> 14:34.670]  the things like nitrogen and phosphorus and magnesium and
[14:35.150 --> 14:41.470]  Potassium that are mobile in the plant if you're seeing that the levels on the lowers are
[14:43.550 --> 14:50.510]  Are the levels on the I mean, sorry, excuse me if you see that the levels are lower on the higher leaves
[14:52.030 --> 14:55.930]  Then you know and and they're equal to the bottom, you know
[14:55.930 --> 15:00.910]  You're getting a sufficient amount of uptake for that specific nutrient. But if you're seeing that
[15:01.630 --> 15:04.150]  The levels are lower on your lower leaves
[15:04.150 --> 15:11.910]  It means that those mobile nutrients are pulling from the bottom supply to help supply the tops of the plant where?
[15:12.190 --> 15:16.510]  most of the energy is being where all the sugars are being made right because
[15:17.230 --> 15:20.310]  Bricks is also a measure of your sugar content, right?
[15:20.390 --> 15:26.950]  The whole purpose of photosynthesis is for a plant to take inorganic elements from the soil
[15:27.510 --> 15:31.510]  right and turn them into organic compounds glucose and
[15:32.230 --> 15:34.230]  so
[15:34.270 --> 15:39.670]  Your sugar content should be higher always higher in new leaves
[15:40.190 --> 15:42.310]  Right because that's where
[15:43.470 --> 15:51.510]  It's all mostly happening and then it's you know, they grow out as the bottom leaves are finished and totally mature
[15:52.230 --> 15:55.950]  They're more of acting as storage potentials
[15:56.390 --> 16:01.510]  right for the stored amino acids and stored phosphates the the
[16:02.430 --> 16:09.210]  Mobile nutrients that can be pulled from those leaves. That's why you see deficiency start mobile nutrient deficiencies
[16:09.750 --> 16:12.510]  Let me ask a quick question on that leaves Brandon
[16:12.510 --> 16:17.910]  so like on when you're testing when you look searching for the lower leaves to test, I guess you're gonna go to the
[16:18.790 --> 16:20.430]  first set of
[16:20.430 --> 16:25.910]  Leaves that look a hundred percent healthy you want to get out of those stuff that's starting to brown or some of that lower stuff
[16:25.910 --> 16:28.750]  Right, you want to go to that first lowest healthiest set?
[16:29.350 --> 16:33.270]  Well, if you look at my plant leaves every single
[16:33.910 --> 16:38.150]  All the leaves even the bottom right? There's no there's nothing happening wrong with them
[16:38.150 --> 16:44.470]  They're just as healthy as the top ones and you'll get that you'll get the fuller bushier growth where?
[16:44.710 --> 16:50.350]  Even the nodes that aren't getting so much exposed to a lot of light are still getting growth, right?
[16:50.910 --> 16:54.870]  You get that if your nutritional sufficiencies are all being met
[16:55.510 --> 17:02.550]  Because the plant canopy and everything that is getting light. It's it's converting, right?
[17:02.550 --> 17:06.070]  It's converting inorganic elements into organic compounds
[17:07.070 --> 17:09.070]  And it's happening
[17:09.350 --> 17:11.350]  Yes
[17:11.630 --> 17:15.030]  Let's go deeper into calcium because I think you know when you're first getting started
[17:16.030 --> 17:18.990]  NPK, you know macro macro macros
[17:18.990 --> 17:25.070]  but it's really the full gamut of even the trace minerals and I do believe calcium and then the
[17:25.390 --> 17:29.590]  Aminos are important to get especially when you're trying to build up these
[17:30.110 --> 17:31.990]  These plants on a healthy basis
[17:31.990 --> 17:37.350]  It does seem like calcium was not maybe spoken on as much as it should have been back in the forum days
[17:37.350 --> 17:39.350]  And so if you are new to this, I'd love
[17:39.670 --> 17:43.350]  Brandon for you to kind of break down the importance of calcium. So
[17:44.430 --> 17:46.430]  calcium is
[17:47.030 --> 17:49.030]  For cannabis a macro nutrient
[17:50.230 --> 17:51.950]  and
[17:51.950 --> 17:55.030]  It's utilized. It's one of the most, you know
[17:55.750 --> 17:57.750]  utilized element and
[17:58.430 --> 18:00.430]  it's important for a
[18:01.110 --> 18:03.110]  Lot of different functions in the plant
[18:04.150 --> 18:06.150]  there's also a correlation between
[18:07.150 --> 18:09.390]  vapor pressure deficit or
[18:10.510 --> 18:13.910]  the ability for the plant to transpire and
[18:14.550 --> 18:15.630]  and
[18:15.630 --> 18:23.510]  Calcium and because and the correlation is this if you do not have enough calcium, right as the plant is
[18:24.110 --> 18:25.950]  transpiring
[18:25.950 --> 18:29.430]  You will not get an adequate amount
[18:30.830 --> 18:32.830]  of calcium
[18:33.510 --> 18:35.950]  In the plant so
[18:37.830 --> 18:43.830]  The way that calcium moves in the plant is is associated with
[18:46.350 --> 18:49.620]  Water uptake
[18:50.180 --> 18:55.540]  So if you're in an environment that is causing the
[18:56.340 --> 19:00.260]  stomata on the plant to shut down and they're not transpiring
[19:02.380 --> 19:05.940]  Water the water is the movement of water is restricted
[19:08.260 --> 19:12.660]  That means the calcium the movement of calcium is also restricted and
[19:14.700 --> 19:21.940]  Calcium can't be pulled from lower parts of the plant. It's an immobile nutrient. So it needs to be able to
[19:23.460 --> 19:25.460]  Be mobilized
[19:25.540 --> 19:30.940]  With those mechanics to get it to all the newer growth that needs it most
[19:31.340 --> 19:33.500]  That's why you want to front load
[19:34.300 --> 19:37.700]  calcium in your veg in your veg stage
[19:38.660 --> 19:40.940]  Calcium and nitrogen you can front load those
[19:41.700 --> 19:49.940]  What I've what I'm mainly seen there's with the people that I work with. There's two ways there that they can go about
[19:50.740 --> 19:53.300]  Their veg right when it comes to calcium and nitrogen
[19:54.060 --> 20:01.260]  There's two really really important aspects for veg and you can't you know, obviously everything's important but
[20:02.540 --> 20:08.860]  If you're adding something like gypsum, you can add that with amino acids or things like soy meal
[20:11.820 --> 20:13.100]  The
[20:13.100 --> 20:16.060]  Blood meal. I personally don't like using too much
[20:16.940 --> 20:19.940]  you know too much animal product, but
[20:20.940 --> 20:23.180]  Nitrogen is tricky right because
[20:24.580 --> 20:26.860]  It's so volatile, right? So
[20:27.860 --> 20:29.380]  It's not all gonna be available
[20:29.380 --> 20:35.900]  Even if it's in an organic form, even if it's in a chemical form and that's the problem with it, right because it's so vile
[20:36.380 --> 20:41.500]  Volatile it's not all getting to the root system and it goes through the nitrogen cycle, right?
[20:41.500 --> 20:46.260]  If you want to know about the nitrogen cycle, you can just google nitrogen cycle and it'll tell you you know
[20:46.260 --> 20:49.140]  how ammonium is converted to nitrate and
[20:50.460 --> 20:54.940]  the how the cycle goes, you know from atmospheric nitrogen to
[20:55.460 --> 20:57.260]  ammonia
[20:57.260 --> 20:59.260]  nitrification and all that stuff so
[21:02.580 --> 21:04.180]  Nitrogen is
[21:04.180 --> 21:12.420]  Really important to front load as well because what I'm seeing is most people are not feeding as much nitrogen
[21:13.460 --> 21:14.780]  Especially when they get in the flower
[21:14.780 --> 21:19.700]  I think there's a mode of thinking that oh you need less nitrogen and while you still you
[21:20.020 --> 21:23.100]  It's not really you need the same amount of nitrogen
[21:24.020 --> 21:27.340]  You just need less of it towards the very end
[21:28.060 --> 21:30.820]  Right, so it's like you need to keep having those
[21:32.500 --> 21:37.820]  That nitrogen be pretty consistent, but once you start getting to week four and five
[21:38.700 --> 21:40.700]  That's when you want to see a drop-off
[21:43.380 --> 21:45.380]  But you but
[21:45.900 --> 21:47.620]  If you're
[21:47.740 --> 21:49.740]  Doing something like using amino acids
[21:50.100 --> 21:55.480]  You could have very little nitrogen sources in your soil and you can just spin spoon
[21:55.700 --> 21:59.200]  Feed right like every time you water every couple of you know
[21:59.580 --> 22:04.140]  Every other water and what it is, whatever it is. You can add in your amino acids in water
[22:04.500 --> 22:10.700]  So I have people that do that and then I have people that will add in you know
[22:11.780 --> 22:16.500]  Nitrogen source that's going to be slow release and then you have to add a certain amount of that
[22:17.220 --> 22:25.020]  To be able to get the nitrogen out of it, you know, and I usually you know people I work with I tell them blood meal or
[22:26.540 --> 22:28.660]  Soybean meal because those have the highest nitrogen
[22:29.620 --> 22:34.140]  Content for what they are for for an organic source of nitrogen, right?
[22:35.780 --> 22:39.700]  Yeah, I gotta agree with that brother yeah that I'm just to jump in on that blood meal
[22:40.940 --> 22:46.260]  Great source of nitrogen. What I do is like you say front loading. I like to go with that kelp meal
[22:46.500 --> 22:52.940]  And then I started taking the blood meal and I ferment it. Do you not like the kelp meal in your in your soil mix at all?
[22:53.300 --> 22:55.300]  No
[22:55.620 --> 22:57.060]  Okay, so
[22:57.060 --> 23:00.900]  We'll get back to kelp though. Okay, keep going keep going though
[23:00.900 --> 23:03.620]  So what I do is I have a multiple sources
[23:03.620 --> 23:09.980]  So I do like an alfalfa kelp and then I like to ferment my blood meal and then I use that as a liquid form
[23:10.580 --> 23:12.580]  As I'm going through veg
[23:12.620 --> 23:19.300]  So I just kind of co-signing with that multiple sources of nitrogen is kind of how I like to go plus the gypsum
[23:19.300 --> 23:21.300]  Of course when I build the soil
[23:21.420 --> 23:27.400]  So whatever amount of blood meal you add in it's gonna be completely broken down within three weeks
[23:28.900 --> 23:34.420]  Unless it's politized, but usually that that blood meal it's a meal. It's already pretty fine
[23:35.140 --> 23:39.340]  The same with soy soybean meal three weeks. It's gonna be completely
[23:40.020 --> 23:42.020]  Gone. Well, see I don't like
[23:42.500 --> 23:43.500]  released
[23:43.500 --> 23:45.500]  The nitrogen that was in it
[23:46.500 --> 23:53.180]  Where are you sourcing your blood meal because from I've always seen a lot of issues with that unless you're using like a
[23:54.140 --> 23:56.140]  quality source just from the
[23:56.580 --> 23:58.020]  the way that from what I
[23:58.020 --> 23:58.420]  understand
[23:58.420 --> 24:03.140]  You know you guys might know more than this than I do all of those or most of the blood meals that you're gonna get
[24:03.140 --> 24:06.220]  Are from the slaughterhouses, so it's just the the worst of the worst
[24:06.980 --> 24:13.900]  From that standpoint, well, that's why I went to the process I get a quality that will just you know, quote-unquote, you know
[24:14.260 --> 24:19.700]  Organic or whatever they want to call it. I saw start there, but that's why I went to the extra step of fermenting it
[24:19.700 --> 24:22.400]  so I take that powder blood meal and I
[24:23.100 --> 24:29.820]  Rehydrate it like you would do an OH n with a mild alcohol and then I'll ferment that and then I'll with
[24:30.900 --> 24:32.900]  like lactobacillus
[24:33.220 --> 24:39.220]  Bacillus in an airtight container for like two weeks just like you do a fermented plant extract or something
[24:39.220 --> 24:44.780]  Yeah, like the microbes tear it up and when it comes out it just has that lab II kind of
[24:45.340 --> 24:48.300]  Cheesy, you know bacillus smell to it
[24:48.300 --> 24:53.820]  And I mean plants like he says it they with it being fermented they take it up even faster
[24:53.820 --> 24:59.500]  Like it's almost like a FAA where when you water that in the next day, you can see results of great like it's very fast
[25:00.380 --> 25:02.380]  Yeah, so, um, I
[25:02.740 --> 25:08.160]  Personally don't use the blood meal. I used I'll use a soybean meal
[25:09.020 --> 25:13.220]  But I give people the option right because not everybody can get
[25:14.820 --> 25:18.420]  One or the other so they have relatively the same
[25:19.700 --> 25:21.700]  nitrogen release
[25:22.260 --> 25:27.820]  And they have the same nitrogen percentage so they can pretty much be used like interchangeably
[25:28.820 --> 25:30.820]  And it just
[25:31.300 --> 25:34.060]  Like some people just have a harder time sourcing stuff
[25:34.580 --> 25:40.340]  But all the people that I personally work with like on a consulting basis we all source
[25:41.220 --> 25:43.220]  everything that everybody uses
[25:43.860 --> 25:45.700]  from
[25:45.700 --> 25:47.700]  from an organic agriculture
[25:48.860 --> 25:50.860]  wholesale supplier
[25:51.780 --> 25:56.820]  What do you think about like pinto beans as a as a protein and nitrogen source
[25:56.820 --> 26:02.780]  I know those are extremely hard to get but it seemed like the real bougie individuals were adding that to the to the mix
[26:03.180 --> 26:05.180]  Yeah. Well, here's the thing
[26:05.860 --> 26:07.700]  the
[26:07.700 --> 26:14.720]  Hydrolyzed soy protein amino acid nitrogen is probably like my favorite right but it's expensive. It's like
[26:16.020 --> 26:17.460]  you know
[26:17.460 --> 26:24.540]  It's it's like the most expensive source of nitrogen that you can get I love it. It's really effective
[26:24.540 --> 26:26.540]  it helps build soil biology and
[26:27.420 --> 26:29.420]  biodiversity of micro populations
[26:29.940 --> 26:33.140]  Well, you know helping save metabolic energy
[26:34.020 --> 26:36.020]  from the you know
[26:36.900 --> 26:38.620]  the
[26:38.620 --> 26:45.000]  The conversion process right because if it's taking up these L chain amino acids, they don't have to you know
[26:45.040 --> 26:50.820]  Convert the nitrogen into the amino acids, right? So it's savings the it saves the plant metabolic energy
[26:53.360 --> 26:59.720]  The again though it's it if you're like operating at scale the the
[27:01.120 --> 27:06.640]  You know the more you increase you have to be looking at things like your cost of input
[27:06.640 --> 27:09.600]  So you have to look at you know, what could I do?
[27:10.080 --> 27:17.480]  What can I use and if something like soy meal or blood meal was an option and it's less expensive
[27:18.760 --> 27:23.120]  That I just you know, I like to give people those options, you know, so that way
[27:24.640 --> 27:27.040]  They can cut their costs if they need to
[27:28.200 --> 27:30.400]  Yeah, another good way to cut costs man
[27:30.400 --> 27:37.080]  It's like JLF's and I don't know if you've even dabbled with those much at all basically plant material microbes and water
[27:37.200 --> 27:40.960]  To down liquid fertilizer. Yeah, and you know and
[27:41.440 --> 27:45.800]  I've got videos on my youtube and stuff where I where I take you know, I
[27:46.680 --> 27:53.320]  You can recycle green waste, you know doing a solid, you know, like a fermentation solid-state fermentation on the material
[27:53.320 --> 27:59.200]  I am anaerobic fermentation and you can you know mash up all your material ferment it
[27:59.680 --> 28:06.560]  you can strain all the liquid extract out of it and use in there that's gonna be full of nutrients and microbes and
[28:08.000 --> 28:13.400]  You know if you do everything well enough like if you can really mulch up your material
[28:14.600 --> 28:18.060]  You can almost completely have everything completely eaten up
[28:19.200 --> 28:21.200]  And almost turn into a liquid
[28:22.080 --> 28:26.160]  Yeah, that's true. And what I what I seem to notice is like, you know
[28:26.160 --> 28:33.080]  That's that takes the kind of as I'm watering in these JLF's and I go fairly high on my e-seek
[28:33.600 --> 28:37.200]  Treat it like I'm like I would back in the bottle days, you know
[28:37.200 --> 28:42.280]  I mean I'm matching my EC of my feeds to my light and stage of plant growth
[28:42.600 --> 28:46.280]  And I'm able to push them push them pretty hard and I've seen and what I notice is that
[28:46.880 --> 28:51.960]  Kind of takes the pressure off the soil, you know, the plants aren't just sucking everything right out the soil
[28:51.960 --> 28:55.040]  I think it's vital to kind of you put these
[28:56.360 --> 29:01.840]  Plant material and residues back in and they'll that's a good way to do that. Well
[29:02.840 --> 29:10.840]  So I was gonna go and talk about the right the front loading of that nitrogen and calcium and veg it can really help
[29:13.120 --> 29:20.080]  Especially if people, you know teeter off of the the nitrogen right right right out the gate and they stop using it and flower
[29:20.920 --> 29:22.920]  well end up doing is
[29:23.660 --> 29:31.000]  allowing them to have a storage potential where that nitrogen can be used but there's a trade-off because if you go and
[29:31.160 --> 29:33.160]  prune up all your plant
[29:33.280 --> 29:35.280]  up to the third node and it's
[29:36.080 --> 29:41.400]  already deficient in nitrogen then it has nowhere to pull from because you just
[29:42.480 --> 29:48.240]  Took all its reserves. So so it's like this weird like I
[29:49.560 --> 29:51.560]  guess kind of
[29:52.000 --> 29:54.760]  Trade-off if you think about it, you know
[29:54.760 --> 30:00.800]  So that's why you know trying to make sure your nutrition is on point in that and that there's enough nutrition in the soil
[30:00.800 --> 30:04.480]  To adequately supplement it throughout the whole cycle, you know
[30:05.000 --> 30:08.880]  one of the things that's important to with these like ferments and adding these
[30:09.840 --> 30:11.840]  plant materials back in is
[30:13.520 --> 30:21.740]  We're talking about what organic is right let's let's talk about that because that that is a little interesting too
[30:22.080 --> 30:24.080]  because
[30:24.120 --> 30:28.880]  Plants for the most part they actually don't use
[30:29.880 --> 30:36.760]  Organic substances with the exception of some low weight molecular compounds like amino acids
[30:37.800 --> 30:43.880]  Okay. So what they use is if you look at a periodic table of elements they use
[30:44.800 --> 30:46.800]  the inorganic
[30:47.000 --> 30:49.000]  elemental form of
[30:51.520 --> 30:56.720]  Nitrogen calcium magnesium, so we're talking about the smallest pieces of
[30:57.680 --> 31:02.560]  An element right that is basically just a couple of atoms these things are
[31:03.680 --> 31:06.400]  Incredibly small. I mean the scales that we're talking about
[31:07.080 --> 31:11.040]  Can only be seen under scanning electron microscopes
[31:11.920 --> 31:19.560]  You know, this is incorrect. This is I don't even know. Yeah, I mean did it's it's mind-boggling right like the scales
[31:20.920 --> 31:22.920]  So that being said
[31:24.080 --> 31:26.080]  They need
[31:27.400 --> 31:32.880]  Certain elements in a certain elemental form. So if we're gonna talk like let's say
[31:34.040 --> 31:38.920]  Phosphorus for instance, it's not just any phosphorus that plant can take up. It has to be
[31:40.040 --> 31:42.580]  P2O5 that is phosphate
[31:43.240 --> 31:45.240]  Right. That is the only
[31:45.480 --> 31:49.480]  chemical that the plant can absorb for phosphorus and
[31:49.880 --> 31:51.880]  You have to think about this too
[31:52.120 --> 31:55.720]  There's three ways that plants can uptake these nutrients, right?
[31:56.240 --> 31:58.240]  So there's mass flow
[31:58.560 --> 32:01.440]  Think about that as you know things coming in contact
[32:02.640 --> 32:04.000]  through water
[32:04.000 --> 32:11.160]  there's inception which is root mining and then there's diffusion and diffusion is where there's
[32:12.520 --> 32:14.160]  where
[32:14.160 --> 32:18.440]  lower concentrating low where there's a lower concentration of
[32:19.000 --> 32:24.240]  lower concentration gradient of nutrient a higher concentration gradient will fill those spaces
[32:24.960 --> 32:30.120]  Like that osmosis. Yeah, it's uh, it's like if you've if you put
[32:31.080 --> 32:34.160]  if you've ever put like a pot a
[32:34.680 --> 32:39.040]  Little house plant in a little watering tray and then you watered the watering tray
[32:39.800 --> 32:44.120]  Instead of watering the top of the plant and the plant will suck up that water, right?
[32:44.120 --> 32:50.520]  It's just evenly distributing what it has available to it, right? That's the same way. So the nutrients will do that
[32:50.520 --> 32:53.880]  They'll distribute themselves throughout the soil as you water
[32:55.000 --> 32:57.000]  and so
[32:57.400 --> 32:59.600]  phosphate that one chemical is
[33:00.680 --> 33:05.040]  Mostly only being absorbed through diffusion, right?
[33:05.040 --> 33:08.160]  That's the only way and and that phosphate element
[33:08.520 --> 33:14.280]  Well, it's an anion and so it'll bond and if we have these high calcium soils
[33:14.800 --> 33:16.800]  the calcium and
[33:16.800 --> 33:22.320]  Calcium cation which is a positively charged molecule, right? Which is calcium
[33:22.840 --> 33:24.840]  Ca 2 plus
[33:25.560 --> 33:31.760]  That'll bind with that phosphate group and then it'll create calcium phosphate it'll participate
[33:33.880 --> 33:35.800]  Participate out of
[33:35.800 --> 33:38.480]  Solution into something that's not available to the plant
[33:38.600 --> 33:42.400]  so these types of reactions are always constantly taking place and
[33:42.720 --> 33:47.240]  So if you're looking at looking at things from a nutrition standpoint
[33:47.920 --> 33:54.480]  you can see how these things are falling into solution and look and we're looking at the chemical that is
[33:55.320 --> 34:01.320]  Metabolically available those inorganic mineral elements now these inorganic mineral elements
[34:02.520 --> 34:04.520]  really
[34:05.120 --> 34:12.800]  It's really interesting right because the term organic has been used and it's more for for marketing right but listen to this
[34:15.400 --> 34:20.280]  When we define what organic is anything that is organic is attached to carbon and
[34:20.840 --> 34:24.280]  This is really really important, right when we're talking about or
[34:25.120 --> 34:30.280]  Organic matter or in organics what we're really talking about is carbon
[34:30.760 --> 34:32.640]  right in
[34:32.640 --> 34:40.560]  Carbon is really really interesting because it makes up it make it can attach all these other inorganic
[34:42.000 --> 34:46.520]  Compounds to make new molecules and to build substances
[34:48.520 --> 34:51.360]  Okay, it also acts as
[34:54.040 --> 34:57.480]  Some of these chains that they make like the carboxylic acids
[34:58.240 --> 35:05.520]  They'll they'll they'll make these chains, you know, humic and fulvic acids. Why are these carbon compounds so important?
[35:05.520 --> 35:07.160]  Why are you know?
[35:07.160 --> 35:15.080]  Why is organic matter so important and it acts as a like a battery right because they have these native and positively charged
[35:16.760 --> 35:25.080]  Sites on these carbon chains on this organic matter and what this does it allows for those inorganic
[35:26.080 --> 35:28.080]  Mineral elements
[35:29.080 --> 35:32.480]  to stay right to lock on like a magnet and
[35:33.600 --> 35:36.640]  Stay there in a form so they're not reacting
[35:37.200 --> 35:39.960]  With the things that are free floating in solution
[35:40.720 --> 35:42.720]  in the soil and
[35:43.640 --> 35:50.080]  So that is one of the things that's so important about the organic component
[35:50.080 --> 35:57.240]  Right is because it acts as a storage facility to hold on to all of the nutrition that plants need
[35:57.640 --> 36:03.960]  It also feeds biology right because those same elements are being used by the bacteria
[36:04.480 --> 36:07.840]  And the fungi in the soil, right?
[36:07.840 --> 36:13.320]  All of your microbes are using the carbon and then all those inorganic mineral elements as well
[36:14.160 --> 36:17.820]  And so there's a competition always going on, you know
[36:18.820 --> 36:23.860]  Between soil microbes plants minerals nutrition. There's always a
[36:25.100 --> 36:27.100]  chemistry
[36:27.140 --> 36:29.140]  Interchangeably going back and forth
[36:29.420 --> 36:32.340]  when we talk about soils that are deficient in
[36:33.620 --> 36:39.620]  Organic matter what we're saying is that it lacks sufficient carbon to be able to hold
[36:40.300 --> 36:42.980]  things like mineral nutrition
[36:43.060 --> 36:48.260]  That's why soils become dead it can't hold on house biology
[36:48.980 --> 36:51.460]  There's not enough nutrition holding capacity
[36:52.060 --> 36:57.340]  There's not enough and then it dries up all those inorganic elements. They're just
[36:57.980 --> 37:00.780]  Minerals, right? No more organic matter
[37:01.660 --> 37:04.380]  Those things tie up. There's no water
[37:05.060 --> 37:07.060]  holding capacity or water penetration
[37:07.580 --> 37:10.700]  So adding that carbon that organic matter
[37:11.860 --> 37:17.940]  It separates it makes pore space. It starts making new compounds. It starts making these chains, right?
[37:20.940 --> 37:23.820]  Yeah, definitely so it sounds like man it's like
[37:24.500 --> 37:30.420]  You know, I see where you you give everything that the plant needs so these reactions can take place
[37:30.420 --> 37:34.500]  But there's also like you said that microbiology aspect like it
[37:34.620 --> 37:37.940]  Plant receiving that nutrient or being able to take up that nutrient
[37:37.940 --> 37:43.940]  I think that you know, the microbes are in there breaking that down and making those available to is that something that
[37:45.020 --> 37:50.900]  Kind of you've studied like how micro specifically tie into this
[37:50.900 --> 37:57.620]  Um, you know cation exchange or is that yeah. Yeah, so you have to think about it like this
[37:58.820 --> 38:00.820]  the
[38:00.940 --> 38:06.580]  There are some microbes right that can take atmospheric nitrogen these are your as a
[38:07.420 --> 38:11.460]  You're like as a backers, right? Those are one example
[38:13.460 --> 38:16.660]  There are free living soil microbes that can sequester
[38:17.340 --> 38:22.260]  Atmospheric nitrogen and what they do is they end up converting it right because they're also sequestering
[38:24.540 --> 38:27.740]  Other minerals and nutrients in the soil
[38:27.940 --> 38:31.140]  Other minerals and nutrients and there's
[38:32.300 --> 38:35.780]  exchanges taking place so that nitrogen will gain
[38:37.140 --> 38:39.140]  will gain a
[38:39.500 --> 38:40.900]  proton
[38:40.900 --> 38:47.180]  Right and it'll turn into a different form of nitrogen. Now. It just took that night atmospheric nitrogen and
[38:48.060 --> 38:53.820]  Inside of its body and if this is a free living soil microbe, it's now running around
[38:54.620 --> 39:00.500]  With an ammonia molecule, right and that and then once that thing dies
[39:01.020 --> 39:05.740]  Its body is mostly made of it's a organic compound, right? So
[39:06.860 --> 39:09.100]  You could maybe have that thing
[39:09.900 --> 39:14.780]  Break down near the near the root surface, right? And as that thing is
[39:15.540 --> 39:17.540]  transforming it
[39:17.860 --> 39:19.860]  releasing that ammonium
[39:20.180 --> 39:22.180]  It gets into the root
[39:23.220 --> 39:27.260]  So you could see how the sequestering and mobilization
[39:27.780 --> 39:30.740]  Can happen we could see that
[39:31.260 --> 39:37.460]  They'll take in certain elements and they can mobilize them. So maybe something's not in the root zone
[39:37.460 --> 39:42.500]  There's a microbe that isn't in the root zone, right? That's just moving things around there
[39:42.500 --> 39:44.900]  So that there that's one part of mobilization
[39:44.900 --> 39:48.940]  Then you also have the plant is
[39:50.220 --> 39:56.500]  Basically taking in inorganic elements for the most part and then making these
[39:58.620 --> 40:04.900]  Organic compounds the majority of which is actually being fed back down to the system
[40:06.300 --> 40:10.140]  And it's you know, it's either pumping
[40:10.380 --> 40:17.900]  Things like hydrogen ions to acidify and decrease pH to make things like maybe iron available or
[40:18.460 --> 40:23.420]  It's creating a compound that you know that can that has a like an enzyme. That's a reductase
[40:24.060 --> 40:28.380]  compound that can reduce something into in of its
[40:29.580 --> 40:32.060]  Molecularly elemental form that's available
[40:32.700 --> 40:36.140]  Right. The plant is doing that stuff all the time. It's not just
[40:36.140 --> 40:42.460]  That are the main functions that's happening is they're dumping a massive amount of what they produce
[40:43.500 --> 40:49.500]  Huge amount more. So if they're they don't already have what's available, right? Because they'll try to
[40:50.540 --> 40:52.060]  compensate
[40:52.060 --> 40:54.780]  Oh, I need to produce this chemical because I'm missing this
[40:55.500 --> 40:57.900]  Oh now they're wasting energy if it's not available
[40:58.460 --> 41:01.340]  So they're dumping a massive amount of what they produce
[41:01.340 --> 41:04.060]  So I need to produce this chemical because I'm missing this
[41:04.700 --> 41:08.060]  Oh now they're wasting energy if it's not there, they're just dumping in
[41:08.940 --> 41:11.740]  They're just dumping an exudate into the soil
[41:12.540 --> 41:18.220]  Trying to mine. Oh, it didn't work. Maybe they'll stop. I we don't know all of those functions, but
[41:19.660 --> 41:21.660]  Do you feel like that's where kind of the
[41:22.940 --> 41:29.980]  The full expression of the plant comes into play the maximizing of the terpenes is when the plant no longer has to use that extra
[41:31.500 --> 41:35.500]  Energy to push to the roots and now it can push up to the to the flowers
[41:36.060 --> 41:42.780]  So the whole so the whole basis of all of these systems whether it's massive agronomic crops
[41:43.420 --> 41:47.740]  is energy conservation right because if we want to
[41:48.680 --> 41:51.660]  maximize our efficiency with what we're using
[41:52.460 --> 41:55.260]  We can only push these things so far right because in
[41:56.040 --> 42:00.220]  Inherently some of their systems are flawed right because these systems were created
[42:01.420 --> 42:03.420]  you know tens
[42:03.660 --> 42:05.660]  hundreds of millions of years ago
[42:06.300 --> 42:07.980]  and
[42:07.980 --> 42:09.980]  The environmental conditions were different back then
[42:10.700 --> 42:12.540]  right, so
[42:12.540 --> 42:14.380]  um
[42:14.380 --> 42:16.380]  If we're talking about
[42:17.480 --> 42:22.640]  Increasing terpenes and cannabinoids what exactly are terpenes and cannabinoids?
[42:23.900 --> 42:25.820]  they're
[42:25.820 --> 42:30.860]  Carbon hydrogen oxygen in certain ratios just like that glucose, right?
[42:31.660 --> 42:35.100]  So the point is to have all of the mineral nutrition that we need
[42:35.740 --> 42:38.960]  For the plant to be able to take carbon from the atmosphere
[42:39.820 --> 42:41.980]  to split the hydrogen from water
[42:43.260 --> 42:44.700]  and then take
[42:44.700 --> 42:51.340]  Those three chemicals the carbon the oxygen and the hydrogen and mix them together to make an organic molecule
[42:52.140 --> 42:55.580]  Right all of these organic molecules are being produced
[42:56.620 --> 42:59.500]  in factories basically inside these plants
[43:00.220 --> 43:02.640]  That require the mineral nutrition
[43:04.300 --> 43:05.660]  So
[43:05.660 --> 43:07.660]  if everything is
[43:08.220 --> 43:11.180]  Where is is on point and it's where it needs to be
[43:11.980 --> 43:14.380]  The plant is not going to have to spend
[43:15.100 --> 43:16.300]  a bunch of
[43:16.300 --> 43:17.580]  energy
[43:17.580 --> 43:19.580]  trying to
[43:20.300 --> 43:24.240]  Mind for the things that it needs right, especially
[43:25.420 --> 43:27.420]  if you have
[43:27.580 --> 43:32.860]  A lot of things like humic fulvic acids a lot of organic
[43:33.820 --> 43:36.780]  Matter in the soil or you know carbon sources
[43:37.500 --> 43:40.720]  Because it's going to hold on to those mineral nutrition
[43:42.620 --> 43:47.680]  And they're going to be in an available form that look at the nutrition is the most important standpoint
[43:48.300 --> 43:49.260]  because
[43:49.260 --> 43:51.260]  Even the beyond even the biology
[43:51.820 --> 43:53.820]  What are they feeding on?
[43:54.140 --> 43:56.140]  They're feeding on the mineral nutrition
[43:56.860 --> 44:03.840]  So we're addressing mineral nutrition and carbon together that's where we're going to get the maximized benefits
[44:09.110 --> 44:11.110]  Are you muted marco
[44:14.420 --> 44:17.860]  No, I was I didn't have anything on that except for I mean
[44:18.580 --> 44:22.500]  Let's jump more into carbon because we've kind of been talking about that on a variety of things
[44:23.060 --> 44:23.860]  um
[44:23.860 --> 44:26.820]  You know the best way that we kind of say it for the newer person into this
[44:27.140 --> 44:31.460]  Brandon is that carbon is the currency and if you're really trying to get your utopia built
[44:31.860 --> 44:34.580]  Then everybody's got to have a little extra money in their pocket
[44:34.660 --> 44:40.900]  So, you know when you're first getting into this just focusing on building up, uh, whether you're kind of going more I guess
[44:41.380 --> 44:42.740]  Marco and I's lane
[44:42.740 --> 44:44.580]  I've really focused and i'm you know
[44:44.580 --> 44:49.560]  Using more of the the worms and that kind of stuff or going more your your way from what I understand
[44:50.020 --> 44:53.620]  Is just kind of always moving as like a chess farmer
[44:53.860 --> 44:56.980]  So so like front loading those kind of things like you had mentioned
[44:57.540 --> 45:01.860]  Uh, what what do you think is going to do the same thing? Like I have worms man
[45:02.020 --> 45:05.860]  I have mulch crop cover like that's like my leaves and stuff
[45:05.940 --> 45:10.980]  They're breaking down in my soil. Like there's all that stuff in there all of that's again
[45:11.540 --> 45:13.620]  the earthworms right earthworms are
[45:14.820 --> 45:16.820]  mining for
[45:17.620 --> 45:23.300]  Those same elemental nutrients they like the cells inside the earthworm they need
[45:23.780 --> 45:30.180]  The mineral nutrition now, they're getting it from the bacteria and stuff that they're feeding on and the little bits of scraps and stuff
[45:31.060 --> 45:32.100]  right
[45:32.100 --> 45:37.140]  But what I understand the other ones move in the calcium as well like really speeding up that system
[45:37.940 --> 45:42.580]  so what the earthworms are going to be doing is they're going to be creating a lot of
[45:43.140 --> 45:44.240]  um
[45:44.240 --> 45:49.700]  enzymes right through their digestive system, you know the castings they're full of
[45:50.900 --> 45:52.480]  beneficial
[45:52.540 --> 45:58.560]  Organisms and enzyme complexes. So some of these enzyme complexes can help
[46:01.040 --> 46:05.200]  Okay, think of it like this an enzyme is kind of like a key it can either unlock
[46:06.320 --> 46:10.160]  Or put something together or lock something up so it can break
[46:10.960 --> 46:15.540]  Down and release something like mineralize it if it's like an inorganic
[46:16.080 --> 46:21.440]  Uh substance and you're trying to free something like a phosphate molecule from a phosphorus source
[46:22.000 --> 46:24.000]  Right enzymes can help do that. That's why
[46:24.800 --> 46:26.800]  You know earthworms
[46:27.100 --> 46:28.880]  microbes
[46:28.880 --> 46:34.900]  They create those enzymes like phosphatase, you know, that's one of the enzymes created by a lot of the bacillus bacteria
[46:36.560 --> 46:38.800]  That helps so that helps
[46:39.820 --> 46:41.820]  solubilize phosphate from
[46:42.460 --> 46:47.360]  inorganic mineral sources like the rocks that we have in our in our systems like, uh, you know, like uh
[46:48.160 --> 46:49.680]  calcium phosphate
[46:49.760 --> 46:57.200]  Right, you know it the microbes can solubilize even those groups where you have phosphate and calcium bind
[46:58.320 --> 47:01.040]  they can take microbes and worms and all that they can
[47:02.000 --> 47:03.440]  undo that
[47:03.440 --> 47:06.900]  Right, and so they can free up that calcium and they can free up that phosphate
[47:08.000 --> 47:13.760]  yeah, I feel like the people that understand that that the microbes are the key to breaking a lot of those things because like
[47:14.240 --> 47:19.120]  Everybody knows you can feed a recipe of nutrients and you can grow great plants
[47:19.200 --> 47:24.960]  But like you said man, I think when you're unlocking the minute, you know organic compounds
[47:25.040 --> 47:28.420]  I think that starts with like you said in the soil the microbes
[47:28.880 --> 47:34.160]  Starting there to exudate and then that just transfers on up through the plant. I feel is that
[47:35.040 --> 47:37.680]  it takes the pressure off that plant when it's trying to
[47:38.400 --> 47:42.560]  Produce all these organic compounds like the biggest thing you just said a little bit ago is that
[47:43.120 --> 47:44.880]  the ones it doesn't have to
[47:44.880 --> 47:53.120]  Spend energy creating root exudates, you know when certain relationships are already established and well established they can focus more on the terpenes
[47:54.240 --> 47:58.000]  That yeah, so microbes man. I think no matter what system you have
[47:58.560 --> 48:00.880]  I feel like that living soil is kind of the key
[48:01.120 --> 48:04.800]  I mean, do you agree with that brand and i'm sure you do because you're running a living soil
[48:05.360 --> 48:06.800]  for the most part
[48:06.800 --> 48:12.720]  Yeah, I run I run these like kind of weird, uh systems that
[48:13.580 --> 48:15.580]  Utilize, you know science
[48:16.240 --> 48:22.580]  The science behind everything and all of the organic practices, right all of the like green waste recycling
[48:24.720 --> 48:28.720]  It all comes down to that the the ability for
[48:30.320 --> 48:31.760]  The
[48:31.840 --> 48:34.720]  Mineral elements to be in an available form
[48:34.960 --> 48:41.380]  And so again all that stuff happens in so many different ways. It happens through enzymatic processes
[48:41.920 --> 48:43.920]  it happens through
[48:44.160 --> 48:46.160]  um organic acid productions
[48:47.040 --> 48:49.840]  through the biology it happens with
[48:50.720 --> 48:57.200]  Root exudates and organic acids that the plant can produce enzymes the plant can produce, you know
[48:58.080 --> 49:04.960]  Uh hydrogen ions it's like all of these things all function and work together, right?
[49:05.520 --> 49:09.120]  Because it's all it's all chemistry. It's all driven by
[49:09.680 --> 49:13.120]  The chemistry that is taking place in these in the system, right?
[49:13.680 --> 49:15.860]  And there's an interchangeable relationship
[49:16.780 --> 49:17.920]  between
[49:17.920 --> 49:22.320]  the biology and chemistry and when I say chemistry people shouldn't
[49:23.040 --> 49:28.560]  Get scared because all we're talking we're talking chemistry physics biology
[49:28.800 --> 49:31.760]  They're all the exact same thing. There is no difference
[49:32.240 --> 49:37.040]  The only difference is the way that we view view them on scale. Okay?
[49:38.000 --> 49:39.440]  That's it
[49:39.440 --> 49:42.820]  That's the way that you that you that people should understand
[49:43.600 --> 49:49.840]  Physics chemistry and biology. They are all the same subject. They are just for our own benefit
[49:50.700 --> 49:56.560]  Sectioned off into categories so that way people can think of them on a different scale, right?
[49:56.560 --> 49:58.560]  because when we're looking at biology we can
[49:59.120 --> 50:01.120]  For the most part see that
[50:01.280 --> 50:06.720]  You know in our soils we can see the biology, but we can't see the chemistry and then we definitely can't see the physics
[50:07.120 --> 50:09.120]  without you know it
[50:10.160 --> 50:18.240]  So when we take the tools to be able to look at the enzymes the biology the microbes the organic acids
[50:18.560 --> 50:22.400]  The chemistry behind it and see how it all functions together
[50:23.920 --> 50:25.920]  Now do you test for
[50:26.000 --> 50:29.600]  biology Brandon as well like between runs or you know
[50:29.920 --> 50:33.600]  Do I need to increase biology or you is that anything you kind of focus on?
[50:34.240 --> 50:36.240]  No, I don't because I
[50:36.800 --> 50:44.560]  Regularly use the micro plus as an inoculant and I do that because I actually have seen
[50:44.620 --> 50:49.680]  Firsthand results, but I also have the data to back up what it's doing and
[50:50.240 --> 50:54.480]  again having the consortium of microbes, especially having that
[50:55.440 --> 50:57.760]  photosynthetic bacteria the pseudomonas
[51:00.160 --> 51:02.960]  It has four modes of metabolism so we can take
[51:04.080 --> 51:06.080]  It can break down
[51:06.160 --> 51:11.120]  Inorganic substances from rocks, right? It can solubilize basically rocks and pull what?
[51:11.120 --> 51:14.080]  Nutrition or elements are in those rocks
[51:15.120 --> 51:21.040]  Is that a purple purple non-sulfur bacteria you said yes, correct, right? It's that it's the
[51:21.040 --> 51:25.840]  It's the ferment of yeast and then the several species of bacillus like bacillus plumerius
[51:26.400 --> 51:28.400]  bacillus fermentarium
[51:28.720 --> 51:30.720]  bacillus megatherium bacillus
[51:31.280 --> 51:33.280]  bacillus
[51:35.600 --> 51:37.840]  What's the other one I I probably have a lot of these
[51:38.320 --> 51:41.920]  And what it's been shown on the data is that it's it solubilizes
[51:42.720 --> 51:45.040]  phosphate from phosphorus minerals really well
[51:45.040 --> 51:49.300]  It also really helps with manganese uptake and manganese like the king of micronutrients
[51:50.160 --> 51:51.280]  and
[51:51.280 --> 51:52.640]  um
[51:52.640 --> 51:57.860]  You know with that even just those two alone, even it was just the phosphorus solubilizing
[51:58.640 --> 52:01.840]  That's enough. So it's it's a really good way to get a lot of those
[52:01.920 --> 52:05.860]  Even just those two alone even it was just the phosphorus solubilizing
[52:06.880 --> 52:13.280]  That's enough right, but that product does that the manganese and it can help with that out
[52:13.980 --> 52:15.980]  compete uh outcome, uh
[52:17.280 --> 52:19.280]  I'll compete with the uh
[52:19.760 --> 52:21.760]  the other microbes right because
[52:22.560 --> 52:26.960]  They're using you know, they're they're competing for the same resources and
[52:27.600 --> 52:31.140]  Also what it can also help do is um help mitigate
[52:32.160 --> 52:36.340]  stresses related with like over watering because they're anaerobic
[52:37.260 --> 52:39.260]  foculative anaerobes
[52:39.680 --> 52:41.680]  So they can operate in low
[52:42.480 --> 52:47.040]  Oxygen or high oxygen conditions. So if it was if the water if you accidentally
[52:47.900 --> 52:55.120]  Oversaturate something you're going to have a lot less of a chance of those pathogens to come in and like take a foothold
[52:56.000 --> 52:57.920]  Okay, so that sounds like it'd be a good one
[52:57.920 --> 53:03.440]  If you did get into a little bit of a too wet situation and showing some issues because of that
[53:04.000 --> 53:08.720]  Kind of help bring you back. Yeah, we had a we were kind of using a metaphor for that where it was like
[53:08.800 --> 53:15.040]  You know if you're in florida and there's several uh hurricanes that have come through so especially at the beginning when you're over
[53:15.120 --> 53:18.160]  You know, you're trying to figure this out. You're probably over watering at the beginning
[53:18.880 --> 53:24.320]  a lot of those issues are coming from if everybody's trying to hold on to that table or what you know, whatever when the
[53:25.120 --> 53:26.720]  hurricane comes through
[53:26.720 --> 53:27.520]  uh
[53:27.520 --> 53:32.000]  The diversity is going to be removed and it's going to be removed each and every time that's happening
[53:32.080 --> 53:33.760]  so the the
[53:33.760 --> 53:39.920]  The street wise individuals the thugs if you will marco are going to be able to take hold once that hurricane has taken over
[53:40.000 --> 53:44.080]  And everybody's trying to to survive just based on that that point
[53:44.160 --> 53:47.440]  so I hope that that kind of gives people more of an idea of what's going on on a
[53:48.000 --> 53:50.480]  you know using more of like an analogy or
[53:51.360 --> 53:55.200]  but taking it to the next level of understanding that when you do over water that
[53:56.080 --> 53:59.760]  There's just so many issues at that microscopic level and then you know
[53:59.760 --> 54:03.380]  We've talked about worlds upon worlds and if you're really trying to get to that utopia
[54:03.760 --> 54:07.220]  That's what brandon is talking about is that you have to get to that diversity
[54:07.280 --> 54:11.680]  You have to know how to build that stuff and maintain that and that's really the other secret
[54:11.760 --> 54:13.840]  uh to your success and some of the other
[54:14.400 --> 54:18.260]  Commercial cannabis farmers. It seems like brandon you're able to keep up that diversity
[54:18.640 --> 54:24.480]  You know i've personally seen your girl buddy and you know rows and rows down for for a long long way and uh, there's no
[54:25.040 --> 54:29.060]  Deficiencies within your system and you know, you don't have to really understand
[54:29.740 --> 54:36.000]  cannabis, uh to the same level I feel like the three of us do to walk into a room and understand plant health and
[54:36.080 --> 54:38.880]  seed plants at at you know when they're overall just
[54:39.680 --> 54:42.000]  Almost shining from from being healthy. So
[54:42.560 --> 54:47.120]  These little nuances these little things that maybe even go over people's heads at the beginning
[54:47.520 --> 54:52.560]  Are definitely something that you want to come back to and I highly recommend our again our first interview with brandon
[54:52.800 --> 54:55.700]  He breaks down a lot of these kind of core concepts
[54:56.400 --> 54:59.360]  And you know, it's worth your time there watching that and then we're you know
[54:59.360 --> 55:04.720]  i'm excited to have you on again brandon because now we can kind of take this, you know, you're farming from a more of a
[55:05.360 --> 55:06.400]  you know
[55:06.400 --> 55:11.120]  You've had a lot more experience on the commercial side of things since I interviewed you just even a year ago
[55:11.520 --> 55:14.880]  Uh, and you kind of blew my mind man when it's only been about three years
[55:15.280 --> 55:19.200]  uh, you've done a hell of a job for yourself man, and you know, there's a big salute to that because
[55:19.520 --> 55:23.840]  I remember when you called me and kind of told me about all of these things that you wanted to do for yourself
[55:24.320 --> 55:28.480]  uh, you know a lot of people talk about that kind of stuff and what they're going to do but you definitely were one of
[55:28.480 --> 55:32.320]  Those that I felt like the whole community had their eye on and now you're here man
[55:32.400 --> 55:36.340]  And you're you're rocking the boat and you're just continuing to give out information
[55:36.880 --> 55:43.440]  and that's why marco and I just really appreciate anybody that that is that has your kind of tenacity as well as uh,
[55:43.980 --> 55:45.980]  Understanding maybe how life really works
[55:46.460 --> 55:51.660]  When you're always taking taking taking, you know, I feel like a lot of us do that in our early 20s and stuff just
[55:51.980 --> 55:57.020]  Thinking that there's only material things. That's the only thing that matters when you when you are humbled
[55:57.020 --> 56:01.660]  Maybe you get locked up for a little bit or you know catch certain things or shit happens to you in life
[56:02.060 --> 56:09.180]  You start to see that there is that balance and you two boys are always giving and so I understand why for whatever reason
[56:09.260 --> 56:11.340]  However, that works karma and all that stuff
[56:12.060 --> 56:17.040]  Why you boys have been able to be successful and things are now starting to flow in both directions
[56:17.340 --> 56:22.220]  Is because of all the things that you are giving so I just want to take a moment to to set that up because I do
[56:22.300 --> 56:23.500]  feel like
[56:23.500 --> 56:25.500]  uh, the community is
[56:25.560 --> 56:26.780]  thriving
[56:26.780 --> 56:30.060]  in part because of what you two are putting out there and brandon, I
[56:30.380 --> 56:32.460]  Wanted to also give you a second. You said that um,
[56:33.180 --> 56:37.180]  You know you wanted to to let everybody have access to your uh drop box
[56:37.180 --> 56:39.180]  So I just wanted to let you talk about that for a second
[56:39.900 --> 56:42.140]  Oh, yeah, that's easy one I I usually uh
[56:43.420 --> 56:49.900]  Every once in a while i'll throw it up on my story or whatever and it's just a link and it's just tons of pdf files
[56:50.220 --> 56:52.220]  a lot of agricultural information
[56:52.780 --> 56:53.800]  on
[56:53.800 --> 56:55.800]  microbes
[56:55.800 --> 57:01.500]  Bokashi's, um, you know plant nutrients just the whole gamut of
[57:02.780 --> 57:06.220]  You know science. Um, here's one of the things that
[57:06.620 --> 57:11.420]  I uh, I have experience with is reading science, right?
[57:12.140 --> 57:17.420]  And science is all great, but it doesn't mean anything unless it is applicable
[57:18.460 --> 57:20.460]  right, so something that
[57:21.500 --> 57:23.340]  um
[57:23.340 --> 57:24.140]  It's
[57:24.140 --> 57:29.980]  Some of the science can be difficult right because you have to be able to figure out if it is applicable and then how to go
[57:30.620 --> 57:32.380]  about applying
[57:32.380 --> 57:33.180]  the
[57:33.180 --> 57:38.460]  The um the methods that you're trying to employ from some of these um from the research, right?
[57:39.660 --> 57:44.620]  things that always things that work in lab don't always work in real life, too, so
[57:45.660 --> 57:47.260]  um
[57:47.260 --> 57:49.420]  I don't know. It's been a weird kind of
[57:51.660 --> 57:54.460]  Journey when it comes to the science stuff, right because
[57:55.660 --> 57:59.580]  It's not just because it's there doesn't you know make it?
[57:59.900 --> 58:01.500]  Um
[58:01.500 --> 58:06.140]  Like definitive it's not like oh, this is how it is because you find another paper that count that'll
[58:07.320 --> 58:13.980]  Contradict, you know some of the other claims that were made previously, you know, so it's just like you have to be able to um
[58:15.580 --> 58:20.460]  You have to be able to kind of take the science even with a grain of salt and see
[58:21.980 --> 58:26.880]  You know how it can be applied, you know, what are its functional?
[58:27.260 --> 58:30.160]  Capacities in real life situation
[58:31.120 --> 58:35.440]  Is there anything that you've kind of um, you know, you've done for years, you know in
[58:35.980 --> 58:39.440]  Construction there's a saying just because you've done it for 20 years on me. You did it, right?
[58:39.680 --> 58:45.600]  But is there anything like that you've done for really long and it works but then the science says it probably shouldn't work
[58:45.600 --> 58:47.760]  But you're like well, I think that still works
[58:47.760 --> 58:53.360]  You know, is it have you found yourself in anything like that or is the science usually kind of winning, you know the battle?
[58:53.960 --> 58:58.760]  There's there's some things that people go back and forth on and that's like
[59:00.200 --> 59:02.200]  Proper pruning techniques, right?
[59:03.360 --> 59:05.360]  and
[59:05.400 --> 59:12.320]  Very objective there's a million ways, right? Yeah, and when it that some of these some of these
[59:13.640 --> 59:19.000]  Some of these things will go very differently depending on the variety of cannabis you're growing, too
[59:19.400 --> 59:23.040]  So it's it's all it's contingent on a lot of different factors
[59:23.560 --> 59:25.560]  Yeah
[59:25.560 --> 59:26.680]  The plant in the room
[59:26.680 --> 59:32.200]  I think I mean that's that's one of the biggest things is people have deficient plants and then hack them up and then talk about
[59:32.200 --> 59:33.640]  How that stuff doesn't work?
[59:33.640 --> 59:38.680]  Well, I mean you just took off all the the solar panels for the plant and she needed that
[59:38.680 --> 59:44.280]  So I do feel like there's way too many variables to just have one certain like this is how it's done
[59:44.280 --> 59:46.120]  And that's why you know with this show
[59:46.120 --> 59:51.440]  You know with this show we want to have on so many guests and have so many ideas and different thoughts because
[59:51.800 --> 59:56.900]  From that it seems like more and more individuals that are younger coming up or finding different ways
[59:57.480 --> 01:00:00.200]  the solvent list game to me is proof of
[01:00:01.040 --> 01:00:06.840]  The younger minded individuals that are able to not only grow their own stuff, but finish their own stuff
[01:00:07.120 --> 01:00:11.280]  That was a pipe dream for me. I know that I know that you know
[01:00:11.280 --> 01:00:16.000]  Other individuals have achieved that but to be able to grow your own stuff and then finish your own stuff into a
[01:00:16.160 --> 01:00:22.560]  Concentrate that was something that I always wanted to achieve. I just never was able to have it at that level. So
[01:00:23.280 --> 01:00:26.160]  Again community. I hope that you guys see that this is
[01:00:26.720 --> 01:00:28.720]  You can sit here a couple hours a week
[01:00:28.760 --> 01:00:33.640]  listen to individuals like Marco and Brandon and all the other people that put up their time for
[01:00:33.960 --> 01:00:36.880]  Future cannabis project and the other podcasts that are out there
[01:00:37.400 --> 01:00:41.280]  And really minimize the years that it takes to get to the same level
[01:00:41.840 --> 01:00:44.720]  Brandon obviously had the knowledge the experience over a lifetime
[01:00:45.280 --> 01:00:48.980]  And then had the life kind of gave him I guess the humility
[01:00:49.480 --> 01:00:54.880]  for him to sit and think about things and where his life wanted to be and that's something that Marco and I've been trying to
[01:00:54.960 --> 01:00:59.720]  To address even at the beginning of this this year with our first podcast for 2022
[01:00:59.720 --> 01:01:03.280]  I know a lot of you guys are feeling like you don't have enough money in your pocket
[01:01:03.280 --> 01:01:08.720]  I understand from from that point getting into the cannabis game is extremely expensive
[01:01:08.720 --> 01:01:15.040]  But that doesn't necessarily mean that you can't start getting the experience and then maybe something pops off where you are able to accelerate
[01:01:15.320 --> 01:01:17.320]  and Brandon was able to have
[01:01:18.120 --> 01:01:22.280]  Basically turn things in take the take the time to really plan things out for his life
[01:01:22.280 --> 01:01:27.880]  And he's he's living proof for the community that it doesn't really take that many years to be able to go from
[01:01:28.680 --> 01:01:35.760]  Hopes and dreams to live and live in the life of that you want and I know it's not just a skyrocket up Brandon
[01:01:35.760 --> 01:01:39.240]  I mean, you know, there's hiccups. That's the way life really should be right?
[01:01:39.560 --> 01:01:44.040]  You can't you can't really understand how beautiful sweet is unless you're tasting bitter
[01:01:44.400 --> 01:01:48.500]  And that's just it seems like how that how that works and especially in the cannabis game
[01:01:49.520 --> 01:01:52.600]  You know ups and downs with people ups and downs with plants
[01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:56.480]  But as long as you've been able to you know, you keep your head down man for the most part
[01:01:56.480 --> 01:02:01.000]  I just see everybody rocking what you know with what you're doing and your vibe and I
[01:02:01.200 --> 01:02:06.880]  Hope that that's what other people see with Marco and myself is that this is more than just about us
[01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:10.620]  You know like this our life really is here pretty short man
[01:02:10.620 --> 01:02:17.360]  And so if we can affect change into the community where more and more people just want to understand farming with a living soil mine
[01:02:17.480 --> 01:02:24.580]  Or that cannabis is medicine because growing up in Atlanta. It was more about just trying to get get cannabis and
[01:02:25.120 --> 01:02:27.860]  Well, we had more like just bullshit weed
[01:02:28.260 --> 01:02:30.660]  So, you know just in my lifetime
[01:02:31.380 --> 01:02:35.860]  We've been able to affect the way that the cannabis is being grown and now from the show
[01:02:35.860 --> 01:02:40.840]  I hope that we are affecting future generations that will understand it without you
[01:02:40.840 --> 01:02:45.100]  that's kind of your vote man without you guys farming and understanding and improving things and
[01:02:45.860 --> 01:02:50.760]  Brandon and Marco and other individuals showing that it can be done and then doing it for profit
[01:02:51.420 --> 01:02:54.800]  That wasn't even you know, no one really saw that on the forum. So
[01:02:55.280 --> 01:02:56.560]  Sorry for talking that long
[01:02:56.560 --> 01:03:01.040]  But I want you guys to see that this is this is attainable for you for you sitting on the couch
[01:03:01.040 --> 01:03:05.920]  It's never grown anything like this is you can start today and in a few years
[01:03:06.080 --> 01:03:06.680]  You know
[01:03:06.680 --> 01:03:11.020]  We've all we kind of said give yourself four years if you really want to do this and get to the commercial level
[01:03:11.480 --> 01:03:13.480]  And invest four years on that
[01:03:13.800 --> 01:03:19.600]  People should be growing gets food at home anyway and stuff like that like with all the stuff going on in the world
[01:03:19.600 --> 01:03:23.520]  It's like every I think everybody should strive to at least
[01:03:24.200 --> 01:03:29.280]  Try to have a little bit of self-sufficiency, you know, I mean I'm gonna be
[01:03:30.720 --> 01:03:36.560]  Hopefully having my own farm where I can grow vegetables and have you know chickens
[01:03:36.560 --> 01:03:38.560]  I live in the city right now, but I'll be
[01:03:39.120 --> 01:03:40.840]  You know
[01:03:40.840 --> 01:03:42.840]  I'll be going soon
[01:03:44.680 --> 01:03:51.040]  Yeah, it's important man, especially like you said now even more so I want to go back to one gold nugget that
[01:03:51.600 --> 01:03:56.880]  That you drop was the calcium a lot of younger folks out there, you know you
[01:03:57.520 --> 01:04:01.920]  You turn that light up and then you see that burn and you think all light burn
[01:04:01.920 --> 01:04:07.960]  Well, you know, it could be the calcium not transporting now showing that deficiency. So a lot of things I think
[01:04:08.840 --> 01:04:12.320]  Calcium is probably one of the biggest ones that gets confused for other
[01:04:12.600 --> 01:04:17.780]  Issues and it's probably one of the simplest to fix and that kind of goes into my one of the questions
[01:04:17.780 --> 01:04:20.420]  I got off IG Brandon
[01:04:22.300 --> 01:04:27.540]  What do you do do you do a foliar routine and then what is the purpose of foliar if you do
[01:04:28.740 --> 01:04:30.740]  no, so
[01:04:31.060 --> 01:04:33.060]  as far as
[01:04:33.740 --> 01:04:40.700]  Doing extra work or making extra work for myself and you have to remember we're talking about like
[01:04:41.660 --> 01:04:46.380]  you know on a commercial or when you start working at scale because
[01:04:46.620 --> 01:04:52.980]  You know doing a foiler application just for the heck of it like I
[01:04:54.300 --> 01:05:00.740]  Wouldn't do that right because it's just kind of it's wasteful. It's unnecessary step
[01:05:02.460 --> 01:05:04.460]  In a case
[01:05:04.460 --> 01:05:10.380]  Where I would need to apply something for you early. It would usually be based off of
[01:05:11.340 --> 01:05:13.340]  Data, right?
[01:05:13.580 --> 01:05:14.660]  Right
[01:05:14.660 --> 01:05:19.060]  so for instance if I got a
[01:05:19.900 --> 01:05:23.460]  Some SAP analysis back or tissue test or something like that
[01:05:24.100 --> 01:05:31.020]  And I saw that my iron was low, but I've been meeting the target requirements for iron
[01:05:31.940 --> 01:05:33.020]  on
[01:05:33.020 --> 01:05:40.940]  My soil tests then I would go and use a foiler application of something like an amino chelated iron
[01:05:41.780 --> 01:05:47.620]  I'm like biomin and you could do a foiler application or here's another example
[01:05:48.900 --> 01:05:50.900]  if
[01:05:51.300 --> 01:05:55.780]  You are seeing some deficiency symptoms
[01:05:57.220 --> 01:06:00.420]  of magnesium, right and
[01:06:04.260 --> 01:06:06.260]  You don't want to apply it to the soil
[01:06:07.260 --> 01:06:11.020]  Like Epsom salt as a top dress or watering it in
[01:06:12.500 --> 01:06:20.180]  And the reason why you might not want to is because you might be at a certain balance for your soil
[01:06:20.820 --> 01:06:23.220]  That's going to be perfect for the uptake of both
[01:06:23.940 --> 01:06:26.500]  Potassium calcium magnesium and the other elements, right?
[01:06:27.060 --> 01:06:27.560]  however
[01:06:27.560 --> 01:06:34.300]  If you go and added more magnesium you might end up be blocking out some of that calcium that you needed and then you might
[01:06:34.300 --> 01:06:36.300]  be showing end up showing
[01:06:36.980 --> 01:06:38.740]  calcium deficiency
[01:06:38.740 --> 01:06:43.740]  Instead of a magnesium deficiency or you might end up pushing your potassium
[01:06:45.460 --> 01:06:50.100]  Out of the way right because magnesium is antagonistic to both of those
[01:06:51.420 --> 01:06:53.140]  so
[01:06:53.140 --> 01:06:54.580]  if
[01:06:54.580 --> 01:06:56.580]  if you're
[01:06:57.340 --> 01:06:58.380]  Going in
[01:06:58.380 --> 01:07:03.900]  Into a situation where you don't want to apply it to the soil because you don't want to push anything out of out of balance
[01:07:03.900 --> 01:07:11.060]  You could use that same Epsom salt and you can add it in a into water and use a foot as a foiler and you
[01:07:11.060 --> 01:07:18.340]  Should be able get the mineral nutrition that that plant needed through that application or through a couple of applications
[01:07:19.220 --> 01:07:24.780]  So there's certain it's contingent right my only foiler like
[01:07:25.620 --> 01:07:31.980]  Applications are going to be integrated pest pest management for the most part right because I'm not trying to feed
[01:07:32.780 --> 01:07:39.740]  Through my leaves and stuff. I'm really trying to make sure that I have enough of everything that I need in the soil and
[01:07:40.260 --> 01:07:44.260]  That is available that Epson salt trick I can co-sign on that
[01:07:44.660 --> 01:07:47.220]  We used to use that for a variety of things
[01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:51.960]  improving other people's grows or just trying to improve and press the suits because
[01:07:52.260 --> 01:07:58.180]  Within a few hours, it seems like things will pop up if there are deficiencies. So we would use a little
[01:07:59.820 --> 01:08:01.380]  Like
[01:08:01.380 --> 01:08:06.380]  Forget the name of it, but it's it's not just your regular like pump chap and sprayer. There's like a
[01:08:08.700 --> 01:08:09.660]  Atomizer
[01:08:09.660 --> 01:08:11.460]  So we'd use the atomizer
[01:08:11.460 --> 01:08:13.460]  And again less is more with this stuff
[01:08:13.460 --> 01:08:18.100]  So a little bit of the Epson salts, and of course, you're gonna want to use garden Epson salt not dr
[01:08:18.100 --> 01:08:19.820]  Teals from CVS
[01:08:19.820 --> 01:08:24.660]  and then you're gonna want to use or our little formula was then just a sprinkle of
[01:08:25.100 --> 01:08:28.580]  Yucca extract and then just a little bit of fulvic
[01:08:29.100 --> 01:08:31.100]  Acid and if you have deficiencies
[01:08:31.340 --> 01:08:34.300]  It'll be noticeable that your plants will react to that
[01:08:34.820 --> 01:08:39.020]  So that's something that I feel if you're newer to this if you're suffering from deficiencies
[01:08:39.020 --> 01:08:41.220]  Brandon just gave you a gold nugget that is tried and true
[01:08:41.700 --> 01:08:44.540]  and then again, of course you can play around with that kind of stuff and
[01:08:45.660 --> 01:08:49.700]  Now make your own little foiler for one tablespoon per gallon
[01:08:51.340 --> 01:08:53.980]  Super simple small and then the yucca is like a
[01:08:54.700 --> 01:08:59.820]  Dusting you know, if you will you just you can use an eighth of that per five gallons of water
[01:09:02.420 --> 01:09:03.700]  Goes super long way
[01:09:03.700 --> 01:09:07.500]  How long is that foliar say if you were to set do a test?
[01:09:07.900 --> 01:09:12.480]  Before foliar let the Epson kick in and then test again
[01:09:12.480 --> 01:09:18.380]  Like how long do you think that nutrient would stay in the plant until you're dropping again probably to reapply?
[01:09:19.340 --> 01:09:21.740]  If I'm seeing a deficiency symptom
[01:09:21.740 --> 01:09:28.540]  I'm used that the plant here's the thing the plant doesn't actually show visual symptoms and stuff tell us about 50%
[01:09:29.060 --> 01:09:31.060]  past it's
[01:09:31.380 --> 01:09:37.020]  It's 50% deficient what it means to start showing visual symptoms. So if you're seeing a
[01:09:39.300 --> 01:09:42.700]  Symptom it means that look at you can see it a
[01:09:43.340 --> 01:09:45.340]  Symptom appear like almost immediately
[01:09:45.700 --> 01:09:49.020]  Right, and it's because it's not getting enough of something
[01:09:49.020 --> 01:09:53.980]  Well, maybe everything else is on point right and that could be the least limiting factor
[01:09:53.980 --> 01:09:58.780]  But I'll do a foiler application if I see something like even starting to appear
[01:09:59.660 --> 01:10:07.140]  Like and I can you like I can usually visually identify a symptom of something pretty pretty early
[01:10:08.820 --> 01:10:10.820]  But
[01:10:10.860 --> 01:10:14.260]  I'll just I'll just do a couple of a couple of applications
[01:10:14.940 --> 01:10:16.580]  you know and if it
[01:10:16.580 --> 01:10:21.580]  Gets to the point where it needs to be if it's really a really big issue
[01:10:22.140 --> 01:10:27.520]  It'll be something in the soil which can be addressed with a top dress or watering something in right?
[01:10:28.780 --> 01:10:30.660]  Yeah, it makes sense
[01:10:30.660 --> 01:10:35.180]  Yeah, so don't biggest thing is if you're seeing deficiencies, you're late, you know
[01:10:35.180 --> 01:10:37.580]  You don't want it like Brandon said you don't even want to see anything
[01:10:37.580 --> 01:10:41.780]  That's how I feel like I'm always looking for anything. It's like
[01:10:42.820 --> 01:10:48.140]  This is my analogy if you're cleaning up something. Well, is that what did you buy it with that spot on it?
[01:10:48.140 --> 01:10:51.620]  Well, then that's a dirt clean it off. So when I'm looking at my plants, I'm looking well
[01:10:51.620 --> 01:10:56.460]  Did that leaf grow with that spot on it? No, it didn't so I'm looking I'm wanting to know what it is
[01:10:56.460 --> 01:11:01.980]  So you guys got to be looking at this stuff early, you know little spots look into them dig into them
[01:11:01.980 --> 01:11:07.420]  Could be a pretty a pest, you know a fit start out as little tiny little white dots sometimes
[01:11:07.740 --> 01:11:09.740]  Might look like some fuzz or something
[01:11:10.100 --> 01:11:14.820]  But if you don't pay attention at the time, you're gonna let them keep going and now you got a big problem
[01:11:15.460 --> 01:11:18.980]  So just staying ahead of the game. Yeah, you gotta stay ahead of it
[01:11:18.980 --> 01:11:22.980]  that's one of the things that's cool about a lot of the testing is that you don't you won't run into
[01:11:23.820 --> 01:11:25.740]  issues if you already
[01:11:25.740 --> 01:11:27.740]  If you have everything that you need, you know
[01:11:28.260 --> 01:11:32.020]  And it's just it's not looking I'm not really I'm not doing anything special man
[01:11:32.940 --> 01:11:35.180]  the the data for
[01:11:36.140 --> 01:11:38.180]  Cannabis for tissue has been around since like
[01:11:41.060 --> 01:11:48.580]  1976 or 77 or something like that, right a lot of this information agronomic data was
[01:11:50.300 --> 01:11:52.300]  Figured out a long long time ago
[01:11:52.380 --> 01:11:58.160]  They do these things for corn they do for soy for wheat for every ag crop tomatoes, you name it
[01:11:58.820 --> 01:12:02.740]  Though they'll for for roses for orchids for all these things
[01:12:02.740 --> 01:12:07.820]  They're like and they have target ranges because they've been able to figure out the agronomic data exactly how much
[01:12:08.620 --> 01:12:13.420]  Nitrogen, you know an acre of corn is gonna require
[01:12:13.980 --> 01:12:18.220]  For a healthy harvest right of this variety, you know
[01:12:18.220 --> 01:12:22.740]  It's gonna know exactly how many pounds per acre of phosphate is gonna be needed
[01:12:22.740 --> 01:12:29.540]  They have the exact amount of levels that need to get into the plant and so they can do the math to see how many
[01:12:29.540 --> 01:12:31.460]  Pounds do we need to apply?
[01:12:31.460 --> 01:12:37.620]  how much of that is gonna remain bio available how much of that is gonna come in contact with the root and
[01:12:38.180 --> 01:12:40.180]  Then they can get an estimation
[01:12:40.740 --> 01:12:47.300]  That creates their ag data. Okay. Well, this is gonna need this much per acre this much picker this much per acre
[01:12:47.300 --> 01:12:50.420]  you can break it down and see the nutrient use efficiency of
[01:12:51.260 --> 01:12:53.260]  everything that you that you have and
[01:12:53.580 --> 01:12:57.100]  Then you can do a calculation of how much is needed to meet
[01:12:57.420 --> 01:13:01.420]  Those target ranges and then if you need to collect more data
[01:13:01.620 --> 01:13:07.500]  You can go and you know test your tissues and stuff throughout in a cycle and be like, oh, you know what?
[01:13:08.100 --> 01:13:12.500]  according to the math it said that I needed X amount of
[01:13:13.260 --> 01:13:15.020]  You know iron
[01:13:15.020 --> 01:13:17.020]  But according to the plant tissue
[01:13:17.500 --> 01:13:22.740]  It's saying that I'm 50% where I should be. So I'm gonna need to double it up on the back end
[01:13:23.340 --> 01:13:26.220]  To put into the soil so that way I get to those levels
[01:13:26.660 --> 01:13:31.260]  Now what an ultimate goal for you then I'm just listening to what we've been talking about today
[01:13:31.260 --> 01:13:35.700]  So knowing how heavy a cultivar specific cultivar feeds
[01:13:36.220 --> 01:13:39.260]  You could check your data of your soil
[01:13:39.740 --> 01:13:46.980]  Going in then after a run knowing that cultivar took this much out and you can kind of have a recipe ready to top dress
[01:13:46.980 --> 01:13:50.300]  And go right on keep flip. That's that's part of okay
[01:13:50.300 --> 01:13:56.900]  so that's an advanced kind of program that I haven't done with anybody but myself because
[01:13:57.460 --> 01:14:04.060]  It's pretty much sufficient for most clients to be able to run the target ranges that I have
[01:14:04.940 --> 01:14:06.940]  for cannabis and
[01:14:07.060 --> 01:14:09.060]  To be able to run those right?
[01:14:09.660 --> 01:14:11.660]  And they'll have great results
[01:14:12.180 --> 01:14:19.060]  Across the board if you really really want to get specific then that's what that's how you build a nutritional
[01:14:19.380 --> 01:14:26.580]  SOP for a specific varietal you go and you cultivate an entire bed of that entire room of that
[01:14:27.020 --> 01:14:33.140]  and then what you do is you make sure that every you start with everything the same and then you just do
[01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:34.620]  You know
[01:14:34.620 --> 01:14:39.940]  you just start collecting data on your soil your saturated paste test your tissue tests and then your SAP analysis and
[01:14:40.380 --> 01:14:45.000]  When you're looking at that and you test let's say you do a bi-weekly test, right?
[01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:50.520]  It might be a lot of testing you might even spend a bunch of money. You don't have to do it as frequently
[01:14:51.080 --> 01:14:53.080]  but the more data you have
[01:14:53.840 --> 01:14:58.680]  The better you're off right you could do you could collect the data with less tests
[01:14:58.680 --> 01:15:04.240]  But still get a really good idea of what you need. And here's an example the death breath that I had it had
[01:15:05.040 --> 01:15:08.320]  less requirement for nitrogen and the higher requirement for
[01:15:09.080 --> 01:15:13.920]  Phosphorus a lower requirement for calcium and a higher requirement for iron, right?
[01:15:13.920 --> 01:15:19.640]  Those were the four things in that specific variety that were different across the board than anything else
[01:15:19.640 --> 01:15:25.040]  And I know that if I'm gonna go and grow that variety that I'm gonna start off with different
[01:15:25.560 --> 01:15:30.880]  Nutritional levels for that for that variety to be able to maximize that varieties
[01:15:31.520 --> 01:15:33.520]  potential for its yield
[01:15:33.560 --> 01:15:40.800]  Because if you don't know that you could be losing you like you're losing potential know it right might not even know it
[01:15:40.800 --> 01:15:45.640]  But if you're looking at the data that you know, right, that's why the the testing
[01:15:46.440 --> 01:15:50.160]  That's why I always tell people if you ain't testing you're guessing
[01:15:51.760 --> 01:15:53.760]  Yeah
[01:15:53.800 --> 01:15:55.800]  These living soil systems
[01:15:55.800 --> 01:16:01.260]  It's all just about balance have your earthworms in their compost your stuff in there add your stuff
[01:16:01.260 --> 01:16:06.140]  But at the beginning of your cycle test it see where it's at and then go. Oh and then go
[01:16:06.140 --> 01:16:09.360]  Oh, I need to increase a little bit of micronutrients easy easy easy
[01:16:09.360 --> 01:16:13.620]  You can top dress that in and then run with it do everything the same add your crop
[01:16:14.060 --> 01:16:21.860]  Add your crop covers add your have your earthworms in there do your chopping drops do your microbials do all that stuff that you normally?
[01:16:22.340 --> 01:16:24.020]  do
[01:16:24.020 --> 01:16:28.460]  But just make sure that when you're starting off that you're where you need to be in your balanced
[01:16:28.940 --> 01:16:31.340]  So then let me ask you this Brandon so
[01:16:33.020 --> 01:16:35.020]  Based on
[01:16:35.100 --> 01:16:37.100]  Based on that testing and
[01:16:38.540 --> 01:16:39.940]  Starting out
[01:16:39.940 --> 01:16:42.900]  No, well, no one where you're starting out is key. All right
[01:16:43.260 --> 01:16:49.220]  What do you think is the potential you could have lost say if you didn't know this about that death breath and the amount of?
[01:16:49.220 --> 01:16:50.660]  Volume you grow
[01:16:50.660 --> 01:16:55.820]  Would you have lost maybe a few percent? What do you think? Yeah. Yeah. Think about that though
[01:16:56.060 --> 01:17:02.580]  It's this isn't gonna be be so impactful for somebody who's on a small time
[01:17:03.420 --> 01:17:08.460]  Grow, but if as you scale or as you start even doing like acreage, right?
[01:17:08.460 --> 01:17:13.780]  Cuz the same exact calm set concepts are applied. You're gonna do your your crop covers
[01:17:13.780 --> 01:17:17.100]  You're gonna do your regenerative agriculture practices
[01:17:17.100 --> 01:17:22.020]  But you're also going to be adding things in to build up that soil and to build up that soil carbon, right?
[01:17:22.620 --> 01:17:24.620]  so
[01:17:25.820 --> 01:17:28.660]  What was the question again, okay, so basically, um
[01:17:29.220 --> 01:17:32.020]  Kind of like okay. No one what you knew about your death breath
[01:17:32.260 --> 01:17:38.020]  Had you not increased your nutrients, but you could have left a lot on the table like for the home grower
[01:17:38.180 --> 01:17:42.300]  Maybe it's a 10% as an ounce or something, you know what I mean?
[01:17:42.300 --> 01:17:46.500]  but for you 10% is you know pounds, you know, so
[01:17:48.940 --> 01:17:51.380]  Depending on scale right the larger you scale
[01:17:52.220 --> 01:17:54.220]  even though small percentages
[01:17:54.780 --> 01:17:57.620]  Become a larger quantity because look at
[01:18:00.140 --> 01:18:02.140]  10% of
[01:18:02.700 --> 01:18:04.260]  a
[01:18:04.260 --> 01:18:06.260]  meter square
[01:18:06.980 --> 01:18:09.140]  versus 1% of
[01:18:11.460 --> 01:18:13.460]  100,000 meter squares
[01:18:14.380 --> 01:18:16.620]  Right. The 1% is
[01:18:17.460 --> 01:18:20.020]  exponentially larger amount
[01:18:21.020 --> 01:18:27.460]  So that's why I so much more important even as you scale up to it's it's even more important because you leave them more
[01:18:27.620 --> 01:18:31.900]  Potential on the table, but if you're a money minded individual
[01:18:32.220 --> 01:18:38.700]  Even at a small scale you pay a couple hundred bucks for testing throughout and you save yourself or you increase your
[01:18:39.300 --> 01:18:40.900]  yield by
[01:18:40.900 --> 01:18:45.580]  Couple ounces, whatever maybe you know that those kind of things may pay for themselves very easily
[01:18:46.140 --> 01:18:53.900]  Well, you guys want to another thing that I feel like especially when you're moving in and helping in individuals or at the larger commercial scale
[01:18:54.700 --> 01:18:56.700]  Losing money is the water
[01:18:57.820 --> 01:19:04.540]  Percentages when you're carrying things out and when people don't really have some kind of protocol in place to finish the cannabis that they're farming
[01:19:05.220 --> 01:19:08.020]  Sometimes that stuff will dry out dramatically obviously
[01:19:09.060 --> 01:19:11.940]  Removing the the gram weight from that water as well
[01:19:11.940 --> 01:19:15.620]  So going from certain percentages down and losing all that
[01:19:15.940 --> 01:19:21.380]  The scale that Brandon is that again to get back to like Marcos point that is a huge loss
[01:19:21.860 --> 01:19:25.780]  For the suits and for you to say face by making silly
[01:19:26.460 --> 01:19:28.460]  Errors like that. So I was hoping Brandon
[01:19:28.460 --> 01:19:34.780]  maybe you could even talk about the importance of curing at the commercial scale of making sure that you're maintaining that that
[01:19:35.020 --> 01:19:39.380]  Moisture weight as well because you're gonna lose that if things go awry and it can't be done
[01:19:39.380 --> 01:19:43.180]  Oh, yeah, you I mean just like if you were doing anything
[01:19:43.780 --> 01:19:50.140]  On a small scale you need to maintain temperatures and you need to maintain your environmental parameter parameters
[01:19:51.060 --> 01:19:54.340]  And you also need to be aware of your handling practices
[01:19:55.180 --> 01:19:57.180]  You know, that's huge
[01:19:59.380 --> 01:20:02.500]  It's it's really no different you need to make sure you have the room to
[01:20:02.500 --> 01:20:06.540]  The capacity to dehumidify and keep the air cool
[01:20:07.860 --> 01:20:13.020]  Yeah, I was a good good point Brian because you kind of multiply your your problem
[01:20:13.020 --> 01:20:16.980]  You keep you kind of throwing money on good money on bad because what happens is like you said
[01:20:17.260 --> 01:20:21.420]  You didn't reach that potential and yield which made everything smaller
[01:20:21.420 --> 01:20:24.500]  Well, you're not gonna get that potential and yield and you're not gonna get that
[01:20:24.500 --> 01:20:28.540]  Potential and yield and you're not gonna get that potential and yield and you're not gonna get that
[01:20:28.540 --> 01:20:34.700]  Potential and yield which made everything smaller. Well when everything's smaller now you could have potentially
[01:20:35.220 --> 01:20:41.260]  Drying issues if you don't quite have everything dialed in on that side. So little things man can really
[01:20:42.100 --> 01:20:46.220]  Snowball on you guys. That's kind of what the point is is taking care of these little things
[01:20:46.740 --> 01:20:48.500]  Chess moves, you know
[01:20:48.500 --> 01:20:54.460]  Well, how many places have you seen that are built where it's like the the bloom rooms are built to capacity, you know
[01:20:55.060 --> 01:21:00.700]  Spared no expense and then they got a little side bedroom that they're trying to run things out and then they don't even have a
[01:21:00.980 --> 01:21:03.060]  You know a finishing room a curing room
[01:21:03.540 --> 01:21:05.860]  So just the design aspect, you know
[01:21:05.860 --> 01:21:10.180]  A lot of this again is the chess moves and at the level that Brandon is at again
[01:21:10.180 --> 01:21:12.260]  I mean just a couple percentage points is
[01:21:13.620 --> 01:21:14.620]  huge
[01:21:14.620 --> 01:21:15.300]  and
[01:21:15.300 --> 01:21:20.060]  you know for a lot of you guys that want to get in and girls that want to get into this space at the commercial
[01:21:20.060 --> 01:21:23.060]  Level when you start to make a name for yourself and you're doing well
[01:21:23.220 --> 01:21:26.900]  There are a lot of individuals that will give you bonuses and stuff
[01:21:26.900 --> 01:21:27.940]  You know if you stand up for yourself
[01:21:27.940 --> 01:21:34.220]  You kind of prove yourself for a little bit and then that's where these little percentages points where you can start to again make a name
[01:21:34.220 --> 01:21:37.660]  For yourself, but also bring home a little more money at the end of the month
[01:21:37.940 --> 01:21:43.300]  Because you are figuring these things out on a grand scale and like Brandon had mentioned
[01:21:43.300 --> 01:21:47.020]  I mean when you're first I mean on grand scale little things matter. I
[01:21:47.580 --> 01:21:49.540]  work with a
[01:21:49.540 --> 01:21:55.540]  Bunch of different farms out here right and these people don't have a whole lot of years of experience
[01:21:56.220 --> 01:21:59.020]  These you know, they're and they're not
[01:21:59.700 --> 01:22:02.460]  These big huge corporations or nothing. These are all
[01:22:04.300 --> 01:22:11.300]  These are all independent companies that have you know built themselves up from you know the ground up and
[01:22:13.180 --> 01:22:16.500]  You know the reason why what I do comes in
[01:22:17.220 --> 01:22:22.900]  Comes into play is because I'm able to help streamline the efficiency
[01:22:23.940 --> 01:22:25.940]  for their feeding
[01:22:26.420 --> 01:22:28.380]  decrease the cost
[01:22:28.380 --> 01:22:31.100]  for all of their inputs and
[01:22:32.660 --> 01:22:36.780]  Maximize their quality and yield and so
[01:22:37.820 --> 01:22:41.580]  It's really it's really really worth it to test
[01:22:42.020 --> 01:22:48.180]  It's so worth it because if you know exactly what and what not to add
[01:22:49.980 --> 01:22:57.380]  It just takes off so much stress of trying to figure out what's going on even if the target levels are
[01:22:58.380 --> 01:23:01.220]  Are all met and you might be seeing a small issue
[01:23:01.620 --> 01:23:07.740]  You can rest assured that that issue isn't gonna be something crazy and get crazy out of hand
[01:23:07.860 --> 01:23:09.860]  It's gonna be something really really
[01:23:10.100 --> 01:23:12.100]  Really mild
[01:23:13.740 --> 01:23:18.460]  So it takes a headache and it's it's just about streamlining your efficiency, you know
[01:23:19.380 --> 01:23:22.900]  Especially for like organics right because this is the thing
[01:23:23.900 --> 01:23:27.380]  and a lot of people are doing things like a compost teas and
[01:23:27.820 --> 01:23:34.140]  You know like ferments and all these other things right and when you start to scale that gets a lot more
[01:23:34.620 --> 01:23:37.100]  difficult because it's more labor-intensive and
[01:23:37.380 --> 01:23:43.420]  You could have a recipe but again at some point if something fails and you don't know how to fix it
[01:23:43.580 --> 01:23:45.820]  The only thing that you have is data
[01:23:47.060 --> 01:23:50.380]  Right. That's the only thing you can truly rely on to fix it
[01:23:51.140 --> 01:23:56.860]  So I feel like when you know for the people that I work with, you know, they're usually
[01:23:57.740 --> 01:24:01.060]  Working on you know, all these people are working on a commercial level
[01:24:01.860 --> 01:24:03.860]  and they need to be able to
[01:24:04.380 --> 01:24:06.380]  not just
[01:24:06.900 --> 01:24:12.460]  Be able to grow a high quality organic product, but they need to be able to
[01:24:14.140 --> 01:24:16.620]  They need to be able to figure out how to do it
[01:24:17.740 --> 01:24:19.700]  with optimum
[01:24:19.700 --> 01:24:22.660]  optimizing their their time and labor
[01:24:23.700 --> 01:24:29.140]  right because things like teas and making your own inputs and stuff like that can be
[01:24:30.420 --> 01:24:33.700]  They can be labor-intensive now for me personally
[01:24:34.700 --> 01:24:41.380]  Like if I have my own farm and I'm doing something, you know, like greenhouses I'm stationed
[01:24:41.380 --> 01:24:43.380]  I have my own property. This is mine. I
[01:24:44.180 --> 01:24:48.620]  Feel like that is a good investment just overall if you're gonna do that stuff
[01:24:48.900 --> 01:24:55.700]  That's a good investment on your labor and your time if you're gonna do bio remediation stuff and you're gonna do
[01:24:56.140 --> 01:24:58.580]  that extra work right because
[01:24:59.340 --> 01:25:01.340]  It's going into your own place
[01:25:01.580 --> 01:25:04.140]  But if you're like a dude who's
[01:25:04.740 --> 01:25:09.820]  Going into this and you're working for somebody else and you're the guy that's growing
[01:25:11.660 --> 01:25:16.140]  It's like how much more extra work and stuff do you want to put in?
[01:25:16.980 --> 01:25:21.540]  Knowing that there's a different way that you could just do a top dress and just keep watering
[01:25:21.700 --> 01:25:23.900]  adding a little bit of microbes every week and
[01:25:24.420 --> 01:25:26.020]  Then you know
[01:25:26.020 --> 01:25:33.540]  So a lot of what I'm doing is focusing on streamlining processes and then fitting in different agronomic practices
[01:25:35.020 --> 01:25:36.380]  depending on
[01:25:36.380 --> 01:25:41.120]  The location, you know if someone's in their place, they own the property
[01:25:41.300 --> 01:25:46.380]  But if somebody's like leasing out a building and they have a huge facility that they don't own
[01:25:48.100 --> 01:25:52.100]  You know, they don't have land around it where they can do stuff, you know
[01:25:52.100 --> 01:25:57.220]  The people that do have land and stuff like that. I'm like, dude, you got to build the land up start composting
[01:25:57.660 --> 01:26:04.460]  Start doing your green waste recycling start building the land too, because if your business allows you to do
[01:26:05.740 --> 01:26:07.740]  outdoor and I
[01:26:07.980 --> 01:26:14.080]  Mean eat or grow other crops, you know, like it's you can utilize the land that you have
[01:26:14.660 --> 01:26:20.540]  To make things for yourself. I mean ultimately that's the most you know, that is the goal, right?
[01:26:21.060 --> 01:26:25.420]  But you know from a business standpoint, that's not how it always operates
[01:26:28.340 --> 01:26:31.000]  Yeah, you got a kind of balance that production
[01:26:31.580 --> 01:26:37.300]  Versus you know costs and it's all got to be a balance because it is a business and I like what you said
[01:26:37.300 --> 01:26:41.140]  Because if you do have your own land, it's more like you're putting it in your own bank
[01:26:41.140 --> 01:26:43.140]  You know, yeah
[01:26:43.140 --> 01:26:49.380]  And I build a compost and I spread it all over the place and I build that soil up as for me and in my
[01:26:49.740 --> 01:26:56.060]  Offspring and people coming behind me. But like you said if you're renting a space, it's it's a different mindset
[01:26:57.300 --> 01:27:01.460]  They definitely can look out and be organic as you you know, as you call it
[01:27:01.460 --> 01:27:06.980]  I mean you could be as natural as possible reaching out to folks like you with the quality inputs, you know
[01:27:06.980 --> 01:27:11.900]  And others that have them but yeah, definitely there's a balance and even for my own my my own
[01:27:12.900 --> 01:27:17.260]  Small operation man. It takes time to make these inputs and that's why a lot of times
[01:27:18.060 --> 01:27:23.860]  You know, I start out I'd sell some surplus. Well now man that surplus is kind of like well damn I need it for myself
[01:27:23.900 --> 01:27:25.380]  you know, so
[01:27:25.380 --> 01:27:30.820]  It does take time to make your inputs, but it is very worth it. You save a lot of money doing it, too
[01:27:33.940 --> 01:27:35.940]  Computer in real quick. It's getting well
[01:27:37.500 --> 01:27:41.760]  Yeah, man family-owned business that's what a lot of them seem like they are out there in Oklahoma
[01:27:42.120 --> 01:27:43.360]  Yeah
[01:27:43.360 --> 01:27:45.480]  If we can implement, you know
[01:27:45.480 --> 01:27:51.640]  Those types of practices help build up the land help people do that kind of stuff that is like, you know, that's the goal
[01:27:52.160 --> 01:27:55.980]  You know, but again, there's different ways to go about it
[01:27:55.980 --> 01:28:02.320]  and so, you know ideally I want to make sure that people had the information that they need and
[01:28:02.640 --> 01:28:06.080]  they have a good quality source of inputs and
[01:28:07.200 --> 01:28:09.680]  You know, I can you know help streamline the process
[01:28:10.040 --> 01:28:15.480]  Do you um just to go right back on testing a little bit more do you so if you go into a guy's facility
[01:28:15.480 --> 01:28:17.480]  They need a little help. Let's you know, they got
[01:28:18.280 --> 01:28:21.840]  20 beds now when you go in there to test each bed
[01:28:21.840 --> 01:28:25.240]  Will you kind of feel them out and say was all this built in one soil?
[01:28:25.800 --> 01:28:27.800]  Kind of how do you kind of?
[01:28:29.240 --> 01:28:31.760]  Yeah, just like the way that you're thinking about it
[01:28:32.960 --> 01:28:34.960]  you want to find out if
[01:28:36.640 --> 01:28:38.640]  You know everything is pretty even
[01:28:39.720 --> 01:28:41.720]  if they if they've got
[01:28:41.840 --> 01:28:46.800]  You know two beds with one company soil three beds with another company soil
[01:28:46.800 --> 01:28:52.680]  And then the rest are like one different company than it then I would be like look you're gonna need to test
[01:28:54.080 --> 01:28:57.480]  Probably gonna need to test all these beds. That's the best way to go about it
[01:28:57.480 --> 01:29:02.160]  Because if you guys are having problems, you don't know where the problems going this one's doing this this this you're all over the place
[01:29:02.600 --> 01:29:08.680]  What someone would do is they would take a multiple site sample from each of those beds and then they would go in
[01:29:09.680 --> 01:29:11.680]  Go and test it now
[01:29:13.040 --> 01:29:15.040]  Usually
[01:29:15.440 --> 01:29:16.640]  That's not the case
[01:29:16.640 --> 01:29:22.400]  That's not what I've really run into typically people get new soil the truck they need to figure out what's wrong with it
[01:29:22.400 --> 01:29:27.160]  because in my opinion, I look I'm not gonna name any names, but
[01:29:28.120 --> 01:29:30.120]  Pretty much every single soil
[01:29:31.800 --> 01:29:34.360]  That you can that's on the market
[01:29:34.360 --> 01:29:40.840]  I don't feel like it will get you through a whole run like you can't load up like a five gallon pot
[01:29:41.160 --> 01:29:44.880]  Put a nice, you know put a and grow a
[01:29:45.680 --> 01:29:52.880]  You know a plant for three months in that with just water and and I've looked at
[01:29:54.600 --> 01:29:57.560]  So many yeah, where you at bro, where's
[01:29:57.640 --> 01:29:59.640]  Let's get Chad on
[01:29:59.640 --> 01:30:05.000]  Cuz he's gonna do a little experiment with that. We behind the scenes. We're trying to say that so this is a great
[01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:10.280]  Let's have a little discussion on there. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, please do talk about the water only soils
[01:30:10.880 --> 01:30:16.840]  Yeah, let's talk about what you want to do first Chad and then we'll let Brandon kind of talk on that point. Oh
[01:30:17.760 --> 01:30:24.480]  Okay. Well, yeah, I've got I've got a couple brands that I'm gonna be giving a shot for water only soils
[01:30:25.040 --> 01:30:29.600]  Granted it's not I'm not aiming to grow a commercial sized plant. I'm trying to
[01:30:30.320 --> 01:30:36.880]  Experiment for home growers essentially somebody in a tent that might grow, you know, maybe a three foot plant four foot at the max
[01:30:37.800 --> 01:30:43.760]  But yeah, I have a couple brands. I'm ready to transplant today. I'll be documenting it but
[01:30:44.920 --> 01:30:51.160]  There's some there's some interesting comparisons. There's big differences between the two, but I'll be eager to hear what you say
[01:30:51.760 --> 01:30:57.040]  But one thing that you know, both companies advise is again you have a limited battery
[01:30:57.160 --> 01:31:02.720]  You need a particular size of pot and it's meant to last this long if you go any further
[01:31:03.160 --> 01:31:09.240]  Both of them are up front. You might need to reamend. So that's kind of where that stands out right now
[01:31:10.440 --> 01:31:12.440]  Yeah, I you know
[01:31:13.200 --> 01:31:15.200]  even if
[01:31:15.680 --> 01:31:21.000]  There's like a couple soils build the soils pretty sufficient. They have a really good
[01:31:21.920 --> 01:31:24.400]  They have a really good soil. I've used their soil before
[01:31:25.440 --> 01:31:29.120]  And they do the same testing with Logan labs, you know, so
[01:31:29.840 --> 01:31:31.840]  That's kind of beneficial, too
[01:31:32.200 --> 01:31:34.200]  I
[01:31:34.200 --> 01:31:42.200]  Have I actually manufacture saw I manufacture soil on a larger scale out here for commercial farms and I was I
[01:31:43.200 --> 01:31:45.000]  have been
[01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:46.560]  testing out
[01:31:46.560 --> 01:31:48.560]  different blends
[01:31:51.360 --> 01:31:57.160]  Because I know the targets that I need to kind of load those soils up
[01:31:58.360 --> 01:32:05.680]  to where it auto front loads the nitrogen and calcium for you, you know have to do nothing to it and
[01:32:06.400 --> 01:32:08.400]  Then be able to get through
[01:32:08.640 --> 01:32:10.640]  pretty much a whole run on
[01:32:12.360 --> 01:32:16.840]  Nothing but just adding a little bit of microbes every once in a while
[01:32:17.840 --> 01:32:23.680]  Sounds good Brandon. What do you think is on the same topic? Well, go ahead Chad you jumped in there. Go ahead
[01:32:23.680 --> 01:32:29.760]  I was just gonna say so then that actually would kind of allude to that water only is
[01:32:30.520 --> 01:32:35.960]  Potential or there has there is potential to a water only system. It needs to be the right one though
[01:32:36.400 --> 01:32:38.400]  Yeah, you have to have the right levels
[01:32:39.040 --> 01:32:41.280]  you have to have the right amount of nutrition if
[01:32:42.080 --> 01:32:44.080]  if you have the I
[01:32:44.160 --> 01:32:48.320]  Mean I'm saying if you're gonna grow from from seed
[01:32:50.360 --> 01:32:54.660]  You should be able to get a good three four week veg
[01:32:55.480 --> 01:32:59.820]  Off of one of these soils and then be able to push all the way through flower
[01:33:00.440 --> 01:33:04.560]  Nice nuts. That's what I'm gonna be trying here. Is there they've already started
[01:33:05.200 --> 01:33:11.340]  In my normal mix, but this is a transplant. This is a difficult, right? This is a difficulty
[01:33:12.340 --> 01:33:13.380]  You
[01:33:13.380 --> 01:33:16.700]  You you you build a soil like that, but you're
[01:33:17.340 --> 01:33:19.540]  But it's look it's it's nutrient rich
[01:33:20.140 --> 01:33:24.460]  So if you go and put a small plant into this soil
[01:33:25.260 --> 01:33:27.260]  So there's a trade-off, right?
[01:33:29.380 --> 01:33:30.580]  So
[01:33:30.580 --> 01:33:33.500]  Well water only is usually something that's achieved
[01:33:34.020 --> 01:33:38.900]  You know, it's something that's thought so this this is why I wanted to talk to you about it chat
[01:33:38.900 --> 01:33:40.900]  So this will be interesting to see
[01:33:41.180 --> 01:33:45.860]  If you know you can go from water only from from day one, basically
[01:33:47.340 --> 01:33:51.100]  What was the gallons that they sized gallon pot that they recommended so we all
[01:33:52.300 --> 01:33:55.060]  Seven was the minimum they say basically
[01:33:55.500 --> 01:34:00.420]  If you put it in a one gallon you have about three weeks kind of like Brandon was saying there
[01:34:00.500 --> 01:34:06.260]  But they also do mention, you know one company in particular. They're calling it the Cyclops method
[01:34:06.900 --> 01:34:10.620]  But we all know when we transplant we put our containers in we have our little hole
[01:34:10.860 --> 01:34:15.500]  Then when we you know, take it out prop pop it in what they recommend is, you know
[01:34:15.500 --> 01:34:21.620]  Start with their full strength soil around that but do the same thing build a hole in it put a lighter mix in the hole
[01:34:21.620 --> 01:34:25.060]  If you're gonna start a seed or go straight to clone in there
[01:34:25.500 --> 01:34:31.540]  My mine were from seed, but they've been in the little four by fours for a week too long
[01:34:31.540 --> 01:34:37.180]  So they've probably got enough roots on them to sustain the initial shock. We'll find out though, right I
[01:34:38.140 --> 01:34:41.380]  feel like you kind of know if your
[01:34:43.220 --> 01:34:49.140]  Plants need to be transplanted. I would the plants roots would
[01:34:50.580 --> 01:34:54.140]  Can you know basically fill up a soil container?
[01:34:56.100 --> 01:34:58.860]  Before it ran out of nutrient I feel like
[01:34:59.860 --> 01:35:03.580]  Okay, you know like if you were in a three gallon pot you would be like
[01:35:03.580 --> 01:35:07.660]  Oh my plants root mound before you saw like the nutrient deficiency side of the things
[01:35:08.260 --> 01:35:11.780]  Right again, cuz that's on a delayed as well
[01:35:12.860 --> 01:35:15.460]  You know from the time of the problem to the time of the symptom
[01:35:16.340 --> 01:35:21.020]  And yeah, I mean just to preface this this this is a this is just an experiment
[01:35:21.020 --> 01:35:24.900]  I was gonna go with a bed, but I'm gonna do different pots and said
[01:35:25.780 --> 01:35:32.180]  Everybody's trying to get me to switch from what I've been doing and what works for me. So this this is step one. Yeah
[01:35:33.220 --> 01:35:37.900]  It's fun that you're gonna be kind of keeping track of this stuff and you know
[01:35:39.820 --> 01:35:41.780]  My soil will be available soon
[01:35:41.780 --> 01:35:45.980]  I am gonna have my own bag soil here and
[01:35:46.300 --> 01:35:49.580]  I'm just got I've got so much different things that I'm working on
[01:35:49.580 --> 01:35:56.220]  So I got to get labeling and I'm getting national registration for all the products that I carry on my website
[01:35:56.980 --> 01:36:00.340]  I'm looking at only listing bunch of stuff and
[01:36:02.900 --> 01:36:09.220]  So that and then the soil thing is gonna be going along with that that neutral pot system with the carbon-based fertilizer
[01:36:10.260 --> 01:36:12.260]  Yeah
[01:36:13.100 --> 01:36:17.260]  How do you um, what do you man where do you think the soil companies go wrong man?
[01:36:17.260 --> 01:36:23.020]  Because if you think about it everybody, you know, you start building soil usually it's a guy right and that guy grows
[01:36:23.260 --> 01:36:29.080]  Where do they go wrong? You know? Well, look they're not going wrong. They're just going cheap. There you go
[01:36:29.080 --> 01:36:32.660]  they're doing it on purpose because they're looking at how
[01:36:33.780 --> 01:36:38.460]  Inexpensively can I make a product and sell it for if you look at?
[01:36:39.180 --> 01:36:43.340]  The ingredients and a lot of these things it might just be a little bit of peat compost
[01:36:44.140 --> 01:36:46.140]  some perlite
[01:36:46.140 --> 01:36:48.140]  some wood chips and
[01:36:49.460 --> 01:36:54.100]  That's it, you know and it's like that ain't really like gonna get you nowhere
[01:36:55.300 --> 01:36:57.300]  even soils that are like
[01:36:57.620 --> 01:36:59.620]  advertised for
[01:36:59.960 --> 01:37:01.960]  You know cannabis I've seen
[01:37:02.620 --> 01:37:04.620]  severely deficient
[01:37:04.660 --> 01:37:06.660]  so in so many departments
[01:37:07.540 --> 01:37:13.060]  It you just you know, and I don't think it's by any fault of their own either. I'm not sure
[01:37:13.780 --> 01:37:21.780]  If look I've actually talked to several people who have started soil companies and these people aren't like agronomists, right?
[01:37:22.260 --> 01:37:26.420]  They're just like I'm gonna put something together. Well, do you know what you're looking for? Do you know what you need?
[01:37:26.420 --> 01:37:33.420]  Do you know what you know your your uh, just the consistency to saturation percentages should be
[01:37:33.420 --> 01:37:36.300]  Do you know like how much micronutrients you should have?
[01:37:37.140 --> 01:37:41.820]  Do you know these things and it's like that's what you need to know if you're gonna build a fucking proper soil
[01:37:41.820 --> 01:37:45.260]  You're gonna need know about soil nutrition and what those levels look like
[01:37:45.260 --> 01:37:49.220]  I mean bottom line you did they can't tell you because I can I can print you out
[01:37:50.580 --> 01:37:56.220]  Two pages that have my standard soil and my saturated paste and my heavy metal content on my soil
[01:37:56.220 --> 01:37:59.700]  You know what? I mean? And that needs to be per batch each batch
[01:37:59.700 --> 01:38:01.740]  They got to run those, you know what I mean?
[01:38:01.740 --> 01:38:06.420]  And I think a lot of a lot of the soil not you I know you do brother a lot of the soil companies
[01:38:06.420 --> 01:38:08.900]  I think they're doing regional shit to where they're like
[01:38:09.060 --> 01:38:14.580]  They're losing kind of a quality control where they're trying to build soils of certain regions to
[01:38:15.100 --> 01:38:20.820]  eliminate kind of the trucking and the shipping and I think the quality control is where a lot of that gets lost because if you're
[01:38:20.820 --> 01:38:24.740]  The man, you know and then now you've got ten soil places around the country
[01:38:25.020 --> 01:38:27.980]  They might not do it as to the standards that you do
[01:38:27.980 --> 01:38:34.260]  I think a lot of it is growth and then putting money over quality. Yeah, but here's the thing to
[01:38:35.180 --> 01:38:39.620]  Everybody who's watching can easily go over to my Bokashi earthworks
[01:38:40.820 --> 01:38:43.780]  IG page and there is a
[01:38:44.460 --> 01:38:50.420]  Soil recipe that I posted that I specifically made out of the most common
[01:38:51.980 --> 01:38:53.980]  The most common
[01:38:54.340 --> 01:38:57.980]  amendments that you can find at a gardening supply store and
[01:38:58.980 --> 01:39:01.660]  that soil has was tested and
[01:39:02.660 --> 01:39:09.220]  I give the recommended amount of what you would need to do to it if you want an extended veg period and
[01:39:10.540 --> 01:39:12.340]  Everything, you know, so I go through it
[01:39:12.340 --> 01:39:17.100]  I go through the data the testing everything so you can see you can go make that soil yourself
[01:39:17.100 --> 01:39:22.420]  You're not buying soil from me and that soil works. That shit is fucking wicked
[01:39:22.420 --> 01:39:28.220]  I see people all the time on IG using that shit. The plants always look bang. See that's the that's the stuff I respect man
[01:39:29.140 --> 01:39:34.540]  Sell it that's cool, but also show people how to make it man. That's dope man. That's where you're giving that
[01:39:34.540 --> 01:39:38.980]  That's where you're giving back and that's the kind of shit that comes back to you and that's why you're doing right?
[01:39:39.340 --> 01:39:42.220]  Here's the difference between that soil and my soil though, right?
[01:39:43.100 --> 01:39:45.100]  my soil is
[01:39:48.300 --> 01:39:54.140]  Like it's I use different in I use different inputs for my soil, right? I don't you I use
[01:39:54.700 --> 01:40:01.480]  Well, no I use the same inputs, but I'm not using like down-to-earth fertilizers, right I'm using different companies
[01:40:02.880 --> 01:40:07.260]  Like like wholesale provider. Yeah, you're using like single source, you know, yeah
[01:40:07.260 --> 01:40:12.200]  We're single so we're not getting our stuff from already branded company, correct?
[01:40:12.200 --> 01:40:14.780]  you know, so it's that's the only difference between
[01:40:15.980 --> 01:40:19.080]  And that's where I feel like the even as a home guy
[01:40:19.080 --> 01:40:25.600]  You can always tell people if you see something you like or somebody's doing something seek those ingredients, you know
[01:40:25.600 --> 01:40:27.600]  And then once you have the raw ingredients
[01:40:28.080 --> 01:40:33.440]  Usually you can replicate or do something similar. It'll be beneficial for you as well at a lower cost
[01:40:33.440 --> 01:40:39.480]  Well, I mean look I was looking at I was on a consult last week and they are
[01:40:40.160 --> 01:40:42.880]  switching over to soils and they were using Athena and
[01:40:43.440 --> 01:40:48.200]  I was like they're gonna use out all the rest of the Athena that they have in the greenhouse
[01:40:48.960 --> 01:40:52.600]  And I was like look I'm gonna show you guys what this is made out of
[01:40:53.600 --> 01:40:55.800]  And I picked up the bag and I was all look at
[01:40:56.760 --> 01:41:02.020]  It says magnesium sulfate. That's Epsom salt. Okay, look
[01:41:03.120 --> 01:41:04.560]  potassium sulfate
[01:41:04.560 --> 01:41:06.560]  It's the same
[01:41:06.600 --> 01:41:14.920]  Minerals that we use for organic production with the exception of it had the DAP diet diamodium phosphate
[01:41:15.680 --> 01:41:17.680]  Which is ammonium phosphate
[01:41:18.520 --> 01:41:19.800]  ammonium
[01:41:19.800 --> 01:41:25.720]  Plants and they don't cannabis doesn't really like ammonium that much they prefer nitrate
[01:41:26.920 --> 01:41:28.920]  but that's kind of like
[01:41:29.440 --> 01:41:31.440]  You know, you don't want that
[01:41:32.080 --> 01:41:39.400]  Those two chemicals together because they dissociate one to ammonium one into phosphate and it goes into our waterways
[01:41:39.960 --> 01:41:42.780]  So that kind of thing has to be remediated
[01:41:43.740 --> 01:41:50.900]  Right, but in these living soil systems you put something like magnesium Epsom salt potassium
[01:41:52.780 --> 01:41:59.540]  They're in the system you're not like running shit off there's not excess nutrient, you know what I mean, it's all
[01:42:00.980 --> 01:42:03.700]  Being utilized in that system
[01:42:05.220 --> 01:42:11.540]  Yeah, staying it staying in a tight or staying in that form where it could not be leached out and lost
[01:42:11.940 --> 01:42:18.260]  We're also not using diammonium phosphate in organics anyway, yeah, that doesn't sound like what we want to use
[01:42:19.500 --> 01:42:23.220]  Well, I'll be I'll be eager to see that coming out Brandon because again
[01:42:23.420 --> 01:42:29.480]  Ultimately the way I want to go is building the soil using a recipe out there that has been successful for other people
[01:42:29.580 --> 01:42:34.760]  That way I could kind of do it on a little bit of a larger scale versus a small experiment
[01:42:34.760 --> 01:42:37.200]  But at the same time again, you know
[01:42:37.200 --> 01:42:41.440]  I really tried to work with the home growers and that includes people who have never grown before
[01:42:42.040 --> 01:42:45.360]  And people with you know, limited time or limited mobility
[01:42:45.360 --> 01:42:46.280]  So yeah
[01:42:46.280 --> 01:42:49.960]  If I can find a bag option out there that I could you know
[01:42:49.960 --> 01:42:56.480]  Be happy with and confident with that's gonna be a game changer for a lot of new people coming into this as you know
[01:42:56.960 --> 01:43:02.360]  Legalization sweeps the nation. I do I do have the other the other fertilizer too, which is
[01:43:02.840 --> 01:43:05.480]  It's interesting because it utilizes
[01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:11.200]  It utilizes a lot of those inorganic elements, but then attaches them to
[01:43:12.680 --> 01:43:14.680]  The carbon yeah
[01:43:14.720 --> 01:43:19.680]  Make you know organic molecule. So it takes the inorganic elements, right?
[01:43:20.440 --> 01:43:23.140]  And then it turns it basically turns them into a new
[01:43:24.280 --> 01:43:27.760]  molecule carbon-based molecule an organic organic molecule
[01:43:28.280 --> 01:43:33.680]  What's that process that a fermentation and you don't have to tell me your secrets but how do you get there?
[01:43:34.360 --> 01:43:40.640]  Well, it's it's it's proprietary. I don't know it right but I can tell you how the process works
[01:43:40.640 --> 01:43:43.080]  And so the same thing if you guys
[01:43:43.840 --> 01:43:49.560]  Ever seen like, you know, the humic or fulvic acids that you buy that are either powdered or liquid
[01:43:50.440 --> 01:43:52.440]  those are usually a
[01:43:52.440 --> 01:43:57.840]  Lot of those are not real true humic and fulvic acids and this is and this is the reason why
[01:43:58.840 --> 01:44:00.840]  they're usually derived from
[01:44:01.440 --> 01:44:03.440]  they're not derived from a
[01:44:06.560 --> 01:44:08.560]  Source that contains
[01:44:08.680 --> 01:44:10.680]  high amounts of
[01:44:10.960 --> 01:44:12.960]  the carboxylic acid
[01:44:13.560 --> 01:44:19.520]  The way that I understand this and so what they're doing is they're taking a higher grade of
[01:44:20.200 --> 01:44:22.200]  raw material
[01:44:22.600 --> 01:44:29.680]  Which is I think he said I think George George was telling me I think it's 40% carbon
[01:44:30.800 --> 01:44:32.800]  25% auction
[01:44:33.520 --> 01:44:37.320]  Oxygen and like 2% hydrogen and so it creates these
[01:44:38.120 --> 01:44:43.040]  These functional groups what are called functional groups and chemistry between the carbon oxygen hydrogen
[01:44:43.320 --> 01:44:49.640]  They and what they're do is they'll take this raw ingredient. They micronize it. So they throw they put it through a grinder
[01:44:50.640 --> 01:44:53.160]  And then they put it into a
[01:44:54.280 --> 01:45:00.240]  reactor and then they change the pH they use a catalyst to change the pH and
[01:45:01.520 --> 01:45:07.440]  Then they introduce all of the all of the minerals in there. They put in
[01:45:08.080 --> 01:45:10.080]  Like your iron sulfate, right?
[01:45:10.200 --> 01:45:12.200]  the they use
[01:45:12.320 --> 01:45:17.280]  all the mineral sulfates for all the micronutrients and then I think he uses
[01:45:17.320 --> 01:45:21.560]  Potassium hydroxide which is a pure
[01:45:23.600 --> 01:45:28.160]  Potassium ions and that it's that's made I think from electrolysis
[01:45:28.160 --> 01:45:35.600]  Well, they'll take the mineral itself and then they'll electro like they'll use electricity to separate
[01:45:36.240 --> 01:45:38.240]  the the pure
[01:45:40.640 --> 01:45:42.640]  Potassium
[01:45:42.640 --> 01:45:44.640]  And
[01:45:45.960 --> 01:45:47.960]  Yeah, so they're taking the
[01:45:48.040 --> 01:45:50.040]  actual elemental molecule
[01:45:50.200 --> 01:45:55.720]  they separate that and they and then they combine everything at a really high pH and
[01:45:56.280 --> 01:45:57.360]  then
[01:45:57.360 --> 01:46:00.520]  After then and then it stabilizes at that
[01:46:02.360 --> 01:46:04.360]  So this is like readily available
[01:46:05.280 --> 01:46:12.440]  Like like immediately available for uptake by the plants then right? Yeah. And so what it does is the
[01:46:13.280 --> 01:46:19.760]  functional groups of carbon they make chains that it's basically pure humic and fulvic acid if you took
[01:46:21.120 --> 01:46:25.080]  Pure humic and fulvic acid what it would it would be would be these chains, right?
[01:46:25.080 --> 01:46:28.800]  And it's all COOH carbon oxygen oxygen hydrogen
[01:46:29.600 --> 01:46:33.040]  They hit it again. It works as a transport catalyst
[01:46:34.520 --> 01:46:39.680]  to actually move around all of those molecules that the plant actually uses and
[01:46:40.400 --> 01:46:46.960]  Then it's because it's attached to carbon right as opposed to just being like in its chemical form
[01:46:47.040 --> 01:46:51.800]  Because if it's in its chemical form and you add it dude, it's gonna decimate that biology, right?
[01:46:51.800 --> 01:46:57.400]  But it's attached to carbon right and the carbon can use that biology and that molecule in that form
[01:46:57.440 --> 01:47:04.520]  So it acts as a transport catalyst not just for the movement of those nutrients for the biology and for the plant
[01:47:04.520 --> 01:47:10.240]  so what's really interesting about this product is that it is a manufactured product that has
[01:47:11.520 --> 01:47:13.000]  inorganic elements
[01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:18.200]  but the science that he uses in the engineering they turn it into a
[01:47:19.520 --> 01:47:21.520]  molecularly organic
[01:47:21.960 --> 01:47:23.720]  molecule that
[01:47:23.720 --> 01:47:28.600]  That brings in carbon back into the system right brings in
[01:47:29.320 --> 01:47:30.800]  nutrition and
[01:47:30.800 --> 01:47:33.360]  Because you're bringing in carbon and nutrition
[01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:40.240]  You increase bio you in increase biomass of microbes, right you start
[01:47:41.200 --> 01:47:47.640]  Improving the soil. So if you're in an agronomic soil can setting and you start increasing
[01:47:48.240 --> 01:47:54.440]  The organic matter percentage you're increasing carbon you increase the microbial percentages
[01:47:54.680 --> 01:48:00.480]  The organic acids that the microbes are producing the enzymes that those are producing then you're creating more new soil
[01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:05.260]  Right. You're also opening up that soil because
[01:48:06.320 --> 01:48:10.920]  You're in you're gonna get more water retention. So you all of these things
[01:48:11.320 --> 01:48:14.600]  Cascade it has a huge cascading effect of bringing in
[01:48:15.280 --> 01:48:19.600]  Those molecular elements with the carbon with the organic
[01:48:20.480 --> 01:48:21.720]  component
[01:48:21.720 --> 01:48:25.680]  Yeah, that's pretty wild. So you guys basically took it down to the ion level
[01:48:26.400 --> 01:48:31.280]  Rearrange things and to a way that the plants will can uptake them very easily
[01:48:31.800 --> 01:48:35.320]  This was actually created by George Caltea's
[01:48:35.320 --> 01:48:41.400]  I have videos of my IG TV on my feed in that section for the IG TV videos and
[01:48:41.680 --> 01:48:48.400]  He was the engineering director on the Apollo space program. Okay. I was wondering about where you got the name NASA
[01:48:48.400 --> 01:48:51.080]  I'm like was he affiliated or what? Yeah, dude
[01:48:51.080 --> 01:48:56.320]  He worked so he worked until I think just a couple of years ago as a private consultant
[01:48:57.120 --> 01:49:00.480]  But he worked there. He was employed by them and he helped
[01:49:01.440 --> 01:49:07.080]  He was he was the engineering director. So he you know put the plans together
[01:49:08.280 --> 01:49:11.180]  Manufacture the rocket that got man to the moon
[01:49:12.040 --> 01:49:17.600]  He's a brilliant man, and he has multiple PhDs and he not only did he design
[01:49:18.520 --> 01:49:20.520]  He designed the
[01:49:20.640 --> 01:49:25.120]  The chemistry to make it happen, right, but he also designed
[01:49:25.720 --> 01:49:32.560]  The ability to make to make it to make it happen. So he like used his brain. He's called the brain at NASA
[01:49:33.400 --> 01:49:36.800]  He used his engineering his structural engineering
[01:49:39.400 --> 01:49:43.280]  Degrees and understanding of structural mechanics his
[01:49:44.040 --> 01:49:48.000]  Understanding of catalytic chemistry and his understanding of
[01:49:52.120 --> 01:49:54.120]  Agronomy and
[01:49:54.400 --> 01:49:59.920]  Agronomics and he applied them all together into one field and what he came up with was look
[01:50:01.720 --> 01:50:07.120]  We he basically like I mean this dude's been operating on the highest levels of science for so many years
[01:50:07.120 --> 01:50:10.960]  He's created a product that is going to change
[01:50:11.640 --> 01:50:16.800]  Conventional agriculture because it can be applied the same way
[01:50:18.440 --> 01:50:22.020]  But with all the benefits of rejuvenation
[01:50:23.360 --> 01:50:25.280]  Did he start this stuff?
[01:50:25.280 --> 01:50:27.960]  patient did this stuff started NASA with
[01:50:28.480 --> 01:50:34.960]  Human nutrition is that or was it always something in his mind about soil or did he just take soil and?
[01:50:35.200 --> 01:50:39.560]  Combine it with something totally different and kind of come up with this. So he was he
[01:50:40.560 --> 01:50:47.600]  You know, he's a structural engineer a civil engineer mechanical engineer and a chemical engineer and so
[01:50:48.080 --> 01:50:51.040]  He worked for some of the largest companies in the world
[01:50:51.920 --> 01:50:57.600]  Like the like chemical manufacturing companies he worked for and this is all like scary stuff, right?
[01:50:57.600 --> 01:51:01.200]  and I talked to him about it and he's like this is you know back in the
[01:51:01.400 --> 01:51:07.680]  60s and 70s when the kind of Green Revolution was when people were finding out about all this new
[01:51:08.640 --> 01:51:10.640]  Science right
[01:51:10.840 --> 01:51:13.560]  That we know now is really destructive, right?
[01:51:15.160 --> 01:51:17.160]  He helped builds, you know
[01:51:18.080 --> 01:51:20.360]  manufacturing facilities and then eventually he
[01:51:20.880 --> 01:51:24.840]  Associated he parted ways from working with these people and he's like look I
[01:51:25.840 --> 01:51:27.840]  worked
[01:51:28.120 --> 01:51:33.320]  With these companies and I you know and through doing so he learned about the
[01:51:33.600 --> 01:51:40.680]  Agriculture right and the agronomy and so he started looking at the biology and he started looking at cellular mechanics and all of the
[01:51:40.680 --> 01:51:45.440]  things that he's already familiar with right he he looked at these things, but he looked at them from a
[01:51:48.080 --> 01:51:55.720]  Engineering perspective so he's looking at how the plant is engineering sugars how the nutrition works and he realizes that
[01:51:56.960 --> 01:52:01.760]  You can't like the same he came to the same realization that we're all coming to right?
[01:52:01.760 --> 01:52:06.200]  we can't continue to farm with the same way things have to be done different and so
[01:52:07.240 --> 01:52:14.120]  He figured out what could be different to change that and so what he did was he created the you know
[01:52:14.120 --> 01:52:19.960]  The chemistry he created the facilities. He created all these things to take these type of
[01:52:21.320 --> 01:52:23.320]  these standardized
[01:52:24.560 --> 01:52:26.560]  Really kind of toxic things
[01:52:27.440 --> 01:52:32.680]  That work to grow crops but also acidify the soil releasing the carbon
[01:52:33.880 --> 01:52:37.840]  destroying the soil biomes and he found out a way to
[01:52:39.080 --> 01:52:45.080]  Utilize them attach them to something to make it so that way the usage the the use efficiency
[01:52:45.720 --> 01:52:49.200]  Increases and then also be able to have that
[01:52:49.840 --> 01:52:58.240]  Regenerative quality that's associated with bringing organic matter organic carbon the nutrition and then being able to build soil as opposed to
[01:52:59.400 --> 01:53:05.240]  Acidify all the organic matter. So no so that way you couldn't like with conventional fertilizers
[01:53:05.240 --> 01:53:07.920]  the biggest problem right is that a
[01:53:08.800 --> 01:53:14.280]  Lot of times people are over applying what they need and they're not there their data points aren't off
[01:53:14.280 --> 01:53:16.280]  And then what happens is it?
[01:53:17.160 --> 01:53:21.360]  Acidifies the organic matter in the soil that organic matter is carbon
[01:53:21.360 --> 01:53:27.520]  so it's releasing those carbon chains breaking down those carbon chains and then the minerals that came from that were
[01:53:28.440 --> 01:53:35.280]  Attached those carbons were used by the plant leaving just the stuff that can't be used in the soil, right?
[01:53:36.360 --> 01:53:38.360]  Now if you can start building
[01:53:38.560 --> 01:53:45.060]  Again we go back to those building up of those populations of microbes right in organic matter in the soil and carbon
[01:53:45.480 --> 01:53:47.880]  Then we start to build new soil, right?
[01:53:47.880 --> 01:53:51.200]  And so he figured out what he needed to do and then he started
[01:53:51.400 --> 01:53:56.920]  Testing it and he had he went to China to test it. Actually he uses American technology
[01:53:56.920 --> 01:54:02.800]  it's funny because they have like posters of them and stuff over there and it says American technology and it's all like like the
[01:54:03.800 --> 01:54:09.280]  Chinese characters and it's it's really cool. I've seen a bunch of their like posters and stuff
[01:54:09.840 --> 01:54:12.300]  But what he's done is he's taken
[01:54:13.200 --> 01:54:18.440]  the right the protein content of rice for this is one of the one of the studies and
[01:54:18.960 --> 01:54:21.760]  Things that they did research on and they took the protein rice
[01:54:21.760 --> 01:54:25.840]  The content of rice protein from 6 to 11 percent that doubled the yields
[01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:30.160]  well inherently increasing the microbiome the
[01:54:30.360 --> 01:54:35.580]  Micro biodiversity in the soils and then actually creating more soil from what they had
[01:54:37.640 --> 01:54:44.120]  So as a residue is a leftover portion now of this fertilizers carbon then so that's just gonna be a building
[01:54:44.120 --> 01:54:48.000]  It's just the leftover residues are gonna be yeah in your soil
[01:54:48.680 --> 01:54:52.840]  Exactly. So what what essentially happens is because you're adding
[01:54:53.840 --> 01:55:00.060]  This carbon now the carbon is still gonna stay in the soil some of it will you know go through the carbon cycle
[01:55:00.060 --> 01:55:01.660]  stuff like that, but
[01:55:01.660 --> 01:55:07.700]  Those molecules that are attached to the carbon. They're not permanent, right? It's just like a weak magnet. So they'll be exchanged
[01:55:08.220 --> 01:55:12.460]  Biology will use them plants will use them. There'll be other things in the soil
[01:55:13.100 --> 01:55:15.100]  Right, that'll be mineralized
[01:55:15.300 --> 01:55:20.980]  Like when we're talking about the building of soil that'll be released and those will be able to stick to those sites as the plant takes
[01:55:20.980 --> 01:55:23.780]  some off right so there's an exchange happening as
[01:55:24.900 --> 01:55:27.020]  exchanging in water and solution as well
[01:55:27.540 --> 01:55:29.540]  But essentially
[01:55:30.940 --> 01:55:36.380]  That carbon remains in the soil acting as a transport catalyst for
[01:55:38.060 --> 01:55:40.820]  Mineral nutrition and then carbon that's being sequestered
[01:55:41.580 --> 01:55:43.780]  right either in the form of
[01:55:44.340 --> 01:55:47.260]  carbon monoxide in the roots right because similar to
[01:55:48.060 --> 01:55:53.740]  The the plants leaf that can take in carbon dioxide the leaf root can take in carbon monoxide
[01:55:54.740 --> 01:55:59.900]  And then also the the microbes are going to be using some of that carbon as well, so
[01:56:00.940 --> 01:56:06.140]  It's gonna be utilized and it's gonna you know aid in the building of
[01:56:07.100 --> 01:56:09.100]  the soil itself
[01:56:10.380 --> 01:56:15.540]  Yeah, it sounds like a cool product now is it you guys got like isn't one for veg or flowers
[01:56:15.540 --> 01:56:21.380]  It's just kind of like a standalone part. Yeah, one really interesting thing, right? You can't typically mix
[01:56:21.860 --> 01:56:25.540]  Things together and that's why you see so many a B and C
[01:56:25.540 --> 01:56:30.060]  And then you see your cow bag and then you'll see your this and that and they have different
[01:56:30.340 --> 01:56:37.020]  The reason why they can't put those together in solutions is because they react right with their molecular their
[01:56:37.820 --> 01:56:44.260]  Molecular forms they will react with different things. They'll create substances that aren't even usable to the plant
[01:56:45.180 --> 01:56:47.020]  with when you have
[01:56:47.020 --> 01:56:51.380]  This carbon-based fertilizer you can put everything in there in a homogenous solution
[01:56:51.380 --> 01:56:59.300]  So you get all your micro and macro nutrients everything the plant needs and it's right there. It's it's in it's in that
[01:57:00.020 --> 01:57:06.100]  Every single drop I got you. So there's no risk of burning because of the way it's the way it's
[01:57:07.900 --> 01:57:10.220]  Composed you still can't burn. Yeah, you can
[01:57:11.100 --> 01:57:18.060]  Because I mean you're gonna have to use a lot of it like too much which is quite a bit
[01:57:18.060 --> 01:57:25.080]  I mean, you're gonna have to probably go about four or five maybe six times the dosage amount. Yeah, it's very forgiving it is
[01:57:25.080 --> 01:57:28.100]  Yeah, so you're not gonna you're not gonna see burning though
[01:57:28.500 --> 01:57:35.300]  If you're using even double the rate even three times usually the rate on a regular size plant
[01:57:35.420 --> 01:57:39.740]  You're just wasting money. You just yeah, it doesn't need it. I mean, right
[01:57:40.220 --> 01:57:46.260]  It even says on the instruction deal didn't you use it four to six times per harvest cycle, you know
[01:57:46.260 --> 01:57:50.340]  So you're not doing a lot of it. It's that you don't need much nice. I
[01:57:51.700 --> 01:57:58.300]  Really like it. It's a it's a it's a the reason I like it is because it's really going to act as a bridge. I
[01:57:58.900 --> 01:58:00.900]  Mean, I like to feature that kind of stuff
[01:58:02.260 --> 01:58:06.700]  In my gardens and stuff like that, but it's really gonna help for
[01:58:07.620 --> 01:58:12.300]  The the transition for mainstream agriculture to get off of
[01:58:12.860 --> 01:58:14.860]  these really harsh chemicals
[01:58:15.500 --> 01:58:19.060]  To where they could apply the same type of practices
[01:58:19.900 --> 01:58:24.780]  Essentially, but use a different product that's gonna have a benefit and then you know
[01:58:24.780 --> 01:58:29.820]  The goal is to actually not just have them use a different product but also
[01:58:30.460 --> 01:58:34.460]  Change their farming practices as well
[01:58:34.860 --> 01:58:38.860]  You know, so they do things like the crop covers don't just switch the product
[01:58:38.860 --> 01:58:43.700]  I really want to encourage people that are gonna be using things like, you know
[01:58:43.700 --> 01:58:49.700]  When you have a huge field of strawberries or huge field of corn, right? Make sure that you have
[01:58:50.740 --> 01:58:54.940]  Things like crop covers, you know and make sure that you're adding
[01:58:55.660 --> 01:58:57.660]  the proper
[01:58:57.660 --> 01:58:59.620]  things to that soil
[01:58:59.620 --> 01:59:04.340]  Right and taking the farming the right practices to maintain soil health and fertility
[01:59:05.140 --> 01:59:06.540]  along with
[01:59:06.540 --> 01:59:09.140]  you know, I'm just I just think it'll uh,
[01:59:09.700 --> 01:59:15.940]  It'll help with that transition big time because I think that's the biggest the draw the biggest drawback is
[01:59:16.460 --> 01:59:24.220]  Trying to get someone who's doing something at such a large scale. That's consistently it doesn't necessarily work
[01:59:24.220 --> 01:59:26.220]  It's just subsidized by the government
[01:59:27.060 --> 01:59:30.260]  But to you know change that practice, you know
[01:59:30.780 --> 01:59:36.460]  End up with higher protein content end up with more nutrition in the food because that's really what it comes down to that
[01:59:37.020 --> 01:59:39.020]  carbon
[01:59:39.020 --> 01:59:41.020]  And that nutrition
[01:59:42.060 --> 01:59:44.060]  Right those microbes
[01:59:44.340 --> 01:59:47.500]  That nutrient cycling capacity all these things are related
[01:59:47.500 --> 01:59:53.420]  You know if we get that nutrition in the plant that nutrition gets into our bodies when we eat food
[01:59:53.980 --> 01:59:55.980]  Right, so that's what it's
[01:59:56.260 --> 02:00:00.140]  you know, the most important factor is is utilizing the
[02:00:00.900 --> 02:00:02.700]  it is
[02:00:02.700 --> 02:00:07.020]  best utilization of resources right in energy and
[02:00:08.780 --> 02:00:10.780]  Getting the highest
[02:00:10.940 --> 02:00:12.020]  efficiency
[02:00:12.020 --> 02:00:19.140]  For what we're using and getting the highest protein and nutritional content out of what we're producing
[02:00:19.140 --> 02:00:21.140]  I mean, those are the goals
[02:00:21.820 --> 02:00:27.340]  Yeah, those are great goals so yeah, like you said if you're gonna use this you definitely want to focus on getting that
[02:00:28.060 --> 02:00:29.980]  microbiology up in your soil
[02:00:29.980 --> 02:00:32.820]  That's gonna help you break down all those carbon chains
[02:00:33.940 --> 02:00:35.660]  what
[02:00:35.660 --> 02:00:41.860]  That's what that so that's what is happening when you're adding in your crop cover up and job or if you're mulching in your leaves
[02:00:41.860 --> 02:00:45.900]  it is the acidification the breaking down of
[02:00:46.820 --> 02:00:54.460]  The carbon in that carbon remember like a protein right protein is carbon hydrogen oxygen and a nitrogen
[02:00:55.300 --> 02:00:58.300]  Right, and so you're gonna break down that
[02:00:59.460 --> 02:01:02.020]  that protein and it's gonna have
[02:01:02.540 --> 02:01:09.180]  Those four elements. Oh, you just released nitrogen. So you're usually getting things like nitrogen phosphorus sulfur and
[02:01:09.180 --> 02:01:13.100]  Potassium are the four main components
[02:01:13.980 --> 02:01:16.980]  That's gonna come from like your organic leaf matter stuff
[02:01:16.980 --> 02:01:22.740]  You're gonna get small amounts of micronutrients up, but those are like the four major and and of course carbon
[02:01:23.940 --> 02:01:27.500]  Carbon is gonna be the largest right by weight the largest
[02:01:28.540 --> 02:01:32.420]  component of any organic substance is carbon
[02:01:33.380 --> 02:01:37.100]  So this is kind of a way of saving a little time and buying a lot of time
[02:01:37.100 --> 02:01:43.260]  Kind of a way of saving a little time and buying time like those chopping drops JLF's they take a little time to break down
[02:01:43.820 --> 02:01:45.820]  this product is already into a
[02:01:47.140 --> 02:01:50.700]  Micronized form they can easily be taken up. So
[02:01:53.220 --> 02:01:54.340]  Well, here's the thing too
[02:01:54.340 --> 02:02:01.020]  So when you do it like a chopping job and you have like organic matter in your system when you're watering in this fertilizer
[02:02:01.060 --> 02:02:08.700]  It's super weird because it actually stimulates the biology and the breakdown of that right because of your you just added a pure
[02:02:09.380 --> 02:02:13.020]  molecularly available carbon source to that system
[02:02:13.020 --> 02:02:19.300]  And so that's gonna bang up your biology real fast and they're gonna start making all these enzymes
[02:02:19.500 --> 02:02:25.700]  Ban that start breaking down that organic material releasing more carbon more minerals, right?
[02:02:25.700 --> 02:02:28.540]  So it's really cool. It's cool stuff, man
[02:02:28.660 --> 02:02:30.660]  It's
[02:02:30.820 --> 02:02:35.940]  Science man, it's like the the cutting edge of science and chemistry and agriculture
[02:02:36.460 --> 02:02:41.700]  Everything just it's rolled into one man. I'm really really excited to be working with these people. I
[02:02:42.860 --> 02:02:48.380]  Love that style your approach is you kind of develop and I'm not to cut you off Brian, but it's kind of dope
[02:02:48.380 --> 02:02:52.380]  I do love the science. I love technology, but I also love that natural
[02:02:53.300 --> 02:02:57.180]  Aspect too. I like to get the you know, the nicest the best kind of
[02:02:57.220 --> 02:03:03.340]  Equipment around my grow as I can if I'm talking indoors, but then have the best most diverse
[02:03:03.860 --> 02:03:08.260]  Biology as well. So I like that approach you guys especially with the test of money
[02:03:09.380 --> 02:03:10.700]  Yeah
[02:03:10.700 --> 02:03:12.700]  You guys want to go down the rabbit hole of kelp?
[02:03:14.300 --> 02:03:16.300]  Yeah, hold on one second
[02:03:17.100 --> 02:03:24.260]  And and to be clear you talking all kelp like kelp meals as well as like if someone was foiler feeding
[02:03:24.780 --> 02:03:26.780]  kelp as a as a as a feed
[02:03:27.500 --> 02:03:30.340]  No, I'm looking for something one second I
[02:03:32.340 --> 02:03:36.500]  Know it's in here. I'm looking at my computer real quick
[02:03:38.460 --> 02:03:40.460]  And we're gonna talk about kelp
[02:03:41.100 --> 02:03:45.500]  Where is it? Oh, I know where it's at. It's down here my downloads. Sorry
[02:03:47.020 --> 02:03:51.460]  So the conventional wisdom was it had 62 trace minerals, you know, it was
[02:03:52.220 --> 02:03:54.220]  It was something that was extremely expensive
[02:03:54.220 --> 02:03:57.020]  It was something that was extremely beneficial
[02:03:57.940 --> 02:04:03.020]  You're getting obviously things from the sea. I feel like at the time that it was being
[02:04:04.060 --> 02:04:08.780]  taught around even in the forums it was because people were using Fox Farm and stuff and
[02:04:09.300 --> 02:04:13.940]  Just didn't have the the needed things. Okay, okay. Okay, okay
[02:04:14.620 --> 02:04:16.460]  okay, so
[02:04:16.460 --> 02:04:21.780]  I'm not gonna like go over a lot of these brands and stuff because I
[02:04:22.220 --> 02:04:26.540]  Was act I was asked to kindly not share everything
[02:04:27.860 --> 02:04:31.100]  About this, but I'm just gonna give you a couple of examples
[02:04:32.500 --> 02:04:34.180]  for kelp meal and
[02:04:34.180 --> 02:04:42.100]  The arsenic levels now, I've heard people on other podcasts and stuff say that oh, there's you know different between
[02:04:42.900 --> 02:04:45.300]  organic like arsenic sugars and
[02:04:46.940 --> 02:04:48.940]  Dangerous arsenic levels
[02:04:49.340 --> 02:04:53.980]  When you're testing for cannabis and heavy metals
[02:04:55.060 --> 02:04:58.940]  There's arsenic detected. You're gonna fail regardless of what type it is
[02:05:00.060 --> 02:05:01.460]  so
[02:05:01.460 --> 02:05:03.460]  I'm gonna give you an example
[02:05:04.140 --> 02:05:06.140]  Just one example right here
[02:05:07.740 --> 02:05:09.740]  The are steeped in the levels
[02:05:10.580 --> 02:05:13.860]  for kelp meal for down-to-earth fertilizers is
[02:05:14.740 --> 02:05:16.740]  30 parts per million
[02:05:19.460 --> 02:05:21.900]  30 parts per million of arsenic. Okay, and
[02:05:25.540 --> 02:05:27.540]  There is
[02:05:30.370 --> 02:05:33.170]  Out of this list which has
[02:05:37.260 --> 02:05:40.180]  It has 17 different brands
[02:05:41.820 --> 02:05:44.900]  There is one brand here
[02:05:46.980 --> 02:05:49.180]  That has less than 2
[02:05:50.660 --> 02:05:52.660]  ppm of arsenic
[02:05:53.980 --> 02:06:00.020]  And everything else is between 29 and 40 parts per million of arsenic
[02:06:01.260 --> 02:06:02.580]  now
[02:06:02.580 --> 02:06:04.580]  it goes
[02:06:05.180 --> 02:06:12.580]  To also, you know blood meals feather meals gypsum potassium all these things have
[02:06:14.060 --> 02:06:16.060]  small amounts
[02:06:16.100 --> 02:06:17.460]  but
[02:06:17.460 --> 02:06:20.740]  If you're adding in a cup or two cups
[02:06:21.380 --> 02:06:25.820]  to your 1.5 bag or two cubic foot bag of
[02:06:26.500 --> 02:06:30.260]  Soil as a top dress or if you're top dressing a half cup of cop
[02:06:31.100 --> 02:06:36.860]  quarter cup of kelp meal to you basically dumping arsenic into your system and
[02:06:39.420 --> 02:06:41.420]  Like things with like
[02:06:42.420 --> 02:06:44.420]  A
[02:06:45.380 --> 02:06:49.260]  Cadmium right rock dust bone meals have cadmium
[02:06:50.060 --> 02:06:55.300]  So you have to be really really careful about what you're putting into that system
[02:06:57.180 --> 02:06:58.580]  Yeah, that makes sense man
[02:06:58.580 --> 02:07:05.180]  I know that with kelp my what I do is I do in a yard of soil and just made one not too long ago
[02:07:05.580 --> 02:07:10.540]  We use two cups in a yard. I mean, so I'm very light, you know, something like that
[02:07:11.420 --> 02:07:15.220]  But yeah with that data you just mentioned I think I'm gonna go ahead just cut that
[02:07:17.300 --> 02:07:21.380]  So, let's say you do two cups per yard
[02:07:22.340 --> 02:07:28.620]  This run and the next run you reamend and you add another two cups. No, I don't
[02:07:29.500 --> 02:07:32.100]  I'm just saying yeah, I couldn't build up on you
[02:07:32.100 --> 02:07:37.580]  I'm giving you an example of how these things show up because you could be like, oh, I didn't fail before
[02:07:38.140 --> 02:07:44.340]  Well, you finally meet met your threshold after you kept adding and kept adding and kept adding because that
[02:07:44.820 --> 02:07:50.500]  Arsenic didn't go anywhere and it just went up right so that could be a compounding problem
[02:07:51.500 --> 02:07:57.340]  Yeah, definitely, you know, you can compound problems. It doesn't necessarily mean you start with the problem
[02:07:57.340 --> 02:07:59.900]  But if you keep adding and adding and adding over time
[02:08:01.500 --> 02:08:05.940]  You create you create issues you could potentially create issues
[02:08:06.340 --> 02:08:10.540]  Since you mentioned a brand that a lot of us have used for a long time
[02:08:10.540 --> 02:08:14.940]  Do you mind mentioning the brand that was legit and had the lower arsenic levels?
[02:08:29.850 --> 02:08:32.950]  Well build a soil is the one that pointed out there's a Department of Ag
[02:08:33.730 --> 02:08:39.290]  from Oregon research on microbials and bottles and how most of it is nil
[02:08:39.850 --> 02:08:43.050]  There's nothing in them buying fancy water
[02:08:47.370 --> 02:08:50.310]  Yes, in question, okay, let's see
[02:08:54.170 --> 02:08:56.170]  At a SPOMA
[02:08:57.650 --> 02:09:02.810]  Will you spell that out you heard of that one Marco? Yeah, that's foam. That's a famous little brand
[02:09:02.810 --> 02:09:09.750]  It's all in all the box stores. I'm surprised. There's a cleanest. Okay, cool ESP. Oh, man. Oh, okay. Yeah
[02:09:09.870 --> 02:09:11.870]  Yeah, Nick for organic gardening
[02:09:13.590 --> 02:09:15.670]  Well, what do you think about two that's pretty
[02:09:16.750 --> 02:09:18.750]  It's 1.5
[02:09:19.150 --> 02:09:21.150]  Not bad
[02:09:21.350 --> 02:09:23.390]  Yeah, it won't affect you won't have any effect
[02:09:24.350 --> 02:09:26.350]  Those levels are real low
[02:09:27.070 --> 02:09:35.630]  So do you think there's sourcing it from like just clean sources? Yeah, it's gotta be a cleaner source. See here's the problem, right? So
[02:09:36.230 --> 02:09:41.310]  Kelp is actually a type of algae, but it's a photosynthetic plant. That's really really
[02:09:41.830 --> 02:09:43.830]  acquiring a lot of
[02:09:43.830 --> 02:09:51.190]  Nutrition all around it and it's taking in everything and stuff can grow at I think some rates at like four feet a day
[02:09:51.950 --> 02:09:53.910]  and
[02:09:53.910 --> 02:09:58.710]  Man, you just think about all the stuff that we have in our oceans and shit
[02:09:59.110 --> 02:10:05.510]  Yeah, just for instance shellfish in the Pacific Northwest they're finding, you know drugs and shit
[02:10:05.510 --> 02:10:10.950]  You know what? I mean just from being things getting flushed in the toilets and going out into the ocean. It's crazy
[02:10:11.510 --> 02:10:16.190]  So yeah, it's just something to be cautious about and it's really hard to find that information, right?
[02:10:16.710 --> 02:10:22.550]  Not a lot of people that can tell you the information maybe private consultants people that have done
[02:10:23.110 --> 02:10:26.150]  The analytics and had the testing done and stuff like that
[02:10:26.430 --> 02:10:30.190]  But it's also a really helpful tool to know especially if you're working on
[02:10:31.310 --> 02:10:39.750]  And you know legal markets that way you're not loading people up with products that will potentially have them fail
[02:10:41.950 --> 02:10:46.750]  So not only testing you got to test the ingredients, I mean it's got that's where it starts
[02:10:47.750 --> 02:10:50.630]  These companies getting a good company to test their stuff
[02:10:50.630 --> 02:10:53.790]  Cool thing is to so you can do like like for me, right? I
[02:10:54.910 --> 02:10:56.910]  I test I test my soil
[02:10:57.750 --> 02:11:01.710]  Saturated paste so I know how it falls in the solution all that but I also do heavy metals, right?
[02:11:01.710 --> 02:11:06.830]  If there was an issue, I'll be able to address it because I'll see oh shit. What the fuck is this?
[02:11:06.830 --> 02:11:08.630]  Like this is way too high
[02:11:08.630 --> 02:11:13.870]  You know, but if you overall you're using the same exact product you're using the same exact product
[02:11:13.870 --> 02:11:18.070]  You're using the same exact product. You're using the same exact product. You're using the same exact product
[02:11:18.270 --> 02:11:23.830]  Overall you're using the same exact product you're gonna make that soil and it's gonna get to the customer
[02:11:24.310 --> 02:11:30.150]  I'll know I can sleep at night knowing that my customers going to be able to get a good product
[02:11:30.150 --> 02:11:33.110]  That's not gonna be contaminated with anything. That shouldn't be there
[02:11:33.670 --> 02:11:34.950]  Yeah
[02:11:34.950 --> 02:11:39.630]  That again, it takes data. You gotta have testing you gotta have proper testing, right?
[02:11:41.150 --> 02:11:46.350]  Like Brian said the consistency and that even comes if you're gonna build soils you're getting different ingredients
[02:11:46.350 --> 02:11:48.630]  Each batch should be kind of tested
[02:11:48.630 --> 02:11:53.910]  You know what, you know what your raw ingredients test before you as the builder even goes as well, right?
[02:11:54.190 --> 02:11:57.110]  It's better to do. Well, that's the cool thing is I work
[02:11:58.270 --> 02:11:59.550]  on a
[02:11:59.550 --> 02:12:01.290]  you know the
[02:12:01.290 --> 02:12:05.590]  Manufacturing society side is way larger scale. So it's like I do it
[02:12:06.910 --> 02:12:08.910]  You know a huge batch
[02:12:10.190 --> 02:12:14.510]  Huge batch have tested have it all packaged up palletized
[02:12:14.950 --> 02:12:20.470]  And I know and I'll be able to rest assured it's all gonna be consistent this and be the exact same thing
[02:12:25.880 --> 02:12:33.120]  Yeah, but it's definitely important man, it's definitely important to test I don't see a lot of people doing it but
[02:12:34.040 --> 02:12:38.560]  There are I know Royal Gold tests kiss organics tests. I know
[02:12:39.240 --> 02:12:41.000]  build the soil
[02:12:41.000 --> 02:12:43.000]  test their soil
[02:12:46.700 --> 02:12:49.820]  Yeah, I got a test got a test I have another question
[02:12:52.020 --> 02:13:00.240]  Um, somebody asked to use saponins in your feed like, you know, everybody's doing the soap nuts and every other thing else
[02:13:00.860 --> 02:13:02.860]  Yeah, hello
[02:13:03.180 --> 02:13:07.280]  You got what do you what are you kind of what's your go-to or do you like no I use
[02:13:09.700 --> 02:13:13.560]  Yaha, I got a buddy that
[02:13:15.260 --> 02:13:20.460]  They get the liquid kind before it's concentrated into a powder so it has more active
[02:13:21.220 --> 02:13:23.220]  more bioactive ingredients and
[02:13:23.940 --> 02:13:26.420]  The cool thing about remember when I was talking about diffusion
[02:13:27.340 --> 02:13:28.500]  earlier
[02:13:28.500 --> 02:13:34.940]  And we have like things that are going to higher and lower concentration gradients or evening out the concentration gradient
[02:13:35.300 --> 02:13:40.940]  The surfactants can help do that. I think that's why people are seeing an improvement in their
[02:13:41.900 --> 02:13:44.500]  their new trick there the quality is because they're getting a
[02:13:44.860 --> 02:13:49.780]  More eat their nutrition in that soil is being more evenly distributed
[02:13:49.780 --> 02:13:55.780]  It's not like pocketed all up in one. Yeah, so that's getting it's flowing into solution easier
[02:13:56.860 --> 02:13:58.860]  in that system, I think that's
[02:13:59.300 --> 02:14:01.300]  Look, I can't be a hundred percent
[02:14:01.900 --> 02:14:04.560]  certain because I don't have data to back it up, but
[02:14:05.380 --> 02:14:09.740]  That's where I feel. I think the benefit is coming from I feel that too, man
[02:14:09.740 --> 02:14:11.880]  I feel like since I've been using them as well
[02:14:11.880 --> 02:14:18.100]  You get the just seems like everything waters down a lot even more evenly into the soil. I think that's probably Keith
[02:14:18.220 --> 02:14:24.460]  Yeah better better penetration I think with water and everything it just overall it's just beneficial overall
[02:14:24.740 --> 02:14:29.380]  Yeah, but there is a limit because if you overdo it the worms kind of get unhappy
[02:14:29.380 --> 02:14:32.060]  I think it just gives them too much of that
[02:14:32.540 --> 02:14:38.820]  you know wedding agent and they can't breathe too well because mine I go heavy water come up to the surface and
[02:14:40.060 --> 02:14:45.260]  They don't die, but they'll come up like they're not happy. So definitely don't less is more folks
[02:14:45.940 --> 02:14:52.120]  Did you want to get into some of those questions that they were asking you Marco on Instagram
[02:14:53.040 --> 02:14:56.200]  Yeah, I was just kind of hitting a few of them as we went
[02:14:58.160 --> 02:15:00.160]  So
[02:15:00.160 --> 02:15:01.240]  I don't know how to say his name
[02:15:01.240 --> 02:15:07.960]  But what are some sources for plant-based amino acid nitrogen other than soil and do you add any PSBs?
[02:15:08.640 --> 02:15:10.640]  phosphates are you guys
[02:15:10.640 --> 02:15:14.480]  Interior I think we talked about that a little bit ago. Yeah, so the micro plus
[02:15:14.480 --> 02:15:18.800]  Okay, so typically when people think of like what is on the market for
[02:15:19.520 --> 02:15:23.440]  phosphor soil like soyball ising bacteria they think of mammoth microbes
[02:15:24.000 --> 02:15:27.120]  It's in my experience. This stuff's really really expensive
[02:15:28.160 --> 02:15:30.640]  And I have a product that does the exact same thing
[02:15:31.440 --> 02:15:37.360]  What's that one called again? That's the micro plus. Oh the micro plus. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, that's got different
[02:15:37.360 --> 02:15:42.880]  It's got the purple non-sulfur bacteria the fermented fungi and several species of besom
[02:15:43.000 --> 02:15:45.000]  That sounds good
[02:15:45.000 --> 02:15:47.000]  and then the aminos
[02:15:47.320 --> 02:15:53.760]  Man, it's mostly soy soy aminos what I use but I need us on my website, too
[02:15:54.720 --> 02:15:57.200]  Yeah, and then you don't use any
[02:15:57.840 --> 02:16:00.640]  Someone has to use FAA. I don't think you do
[02:16:03.200 --> 02:16:08.380]  Oh, here's a good question. Um, did you do a lot of testing I?
[02:16:08.980 --> 02:16:12.340]  Get this a lot people are they get hung up on
[02:16:12.900 --> 02:16:15.460]  If they're using old plant residues
[02:16:15.460 --> 02:16:19.060]  They kind of get hung up on okay. This plant was in veg now
[02:16:19.060 --> 02:16:23.940]  Should it only be used to feed veg plants or this plant was flowering should it only be used to?
[02:16:24.580 --> 02:16:27.460]  Feed flower plants. What's your kind of idea on that? I?
[02:16:28.260 --> 02:16:29.540]  mean
[02:16:29.540 --> 02:16:33.140]  The if you're operating at a proper nutritional
[02:16:35.220 --> 02:16:40.020]  It's gonna be pretty much standard across the board the plant is gonna need just slightly less calcium
[02:16:40.020 --> 02:16:43.700]  Potassium in flour, but other than that
[02:16:44.820 --> 02:16:49.460]  There's not much difference with the exception of you'll have less nitrogen
[02:16:50.180 --> 02:16:52.180]  in the leaves and flour
[02:16:53.620 --> 02:16:58.900]  So, I don't think it would make a difference too much but again I
[02:17:00.020 --> 02:17:01.540]  Always know
[02:17:01.540 --> 02:17:05.700]  Where my levels are at because I test, you know pretty frequently so I'll you know
[02:17:05.700 --> 02:17:09.460]  I'll have to I'll get my test results back tomorrow, right for my
[02:17:10.020 --> 02:17:12.980]  My next for the soil that I just sent out last week
[02:17:13.540 --> 02:17:18.740]  Right, and I'll know oh everything looks good right now. I feel like maybe some calcium
[02:17:19.780 --> 02:17:21.380]  Could be a use
[02:17:21.380 --> 02:17:23.860]  Use a little bit more calcium on a couple of varieties
[02:17:24.820 --> 02:17:28.740]  I'll be able to look at that and then I'll address it if that's the case if it's not the case
[02:17:28.740 --> 02:17:30.740]  I'll be able to see what it is
[02:17:30.820 --> 02:17:36.340]  But from a nutritional standpoint you can pretty much add whatever you want in there, right
[02:17:37.780 --> 02:17:41.620]  But because I'm you'll be able to see it
[02:17:42.820 --> 02:17:45.380]  Right, you'll be able to see if it's too much
[02:17:46.660 --> 02:17:48.660]  Hopefully it's not too much
[02:17:49.060 --> 02:17:51.060]  typically in these organic systems
[02:17:52.180 --> 02:17:55.700]  It's kind of hard to over I mean, I guess it's not too hard to overdo it
[02:17:55.700 --> 02:18:00.660]  But I think it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's
[02:18:00.740 --> 02:18:04.420]  it's good if someone has a small pot and they do this crazy ass big top dress
[02:18:05.460 --> 02:18:08.020]  because typically when when I'm top dressing it's like
[02:18:08.820 --> 02:18:12.360]  Anywhere from like two to like six tablespoons
[02:18:13.300 --> 02:18:15.300]  And it may be like a seven gallon pot
[02:18:15.860 --> 02:18:17.860]  Or I'll use something like
[02:18:18.980 --> 02:18:20.980]  um, you know 500 milliliters
[02:18:22.100 --> 02:18:28.260]  over the surface of uh a yard of soil, right so it's not a lot of
[02:18:28.260 --> 02:18:32.820]  of nutrient that's actually going into these systems.
[02:18:32.820 --> 02:18:35.500]  They're not like these huge, like thick top dresses
[02:18:35.500 --> 02:18:36.420]  or anything like that.
[02:18:36.420 --> 02:18:39.420]  It's like, fuck, hardly anything.
[02:18:39.420 --> 02:18:41.900]  How are you getting out like an even distribution?
[02:18:41.900 --> 02:18:45.100]  If you got like, you say four by 20 bed,
[02:18:45.100 --> 02:18:45.940]  how are you getting that little bit?
[02:18:45.940 --> 02:18:46.780]  Yeah, it's easy.
[02:18:46.780 --> 02:18:50.540]  So you figure out how many yards of soil you have,
[02:18:50.540 --> 02:18:53.500]  and then you just multiply everything by the amount of soil.
[02:18:53.500 --> 02:18:56.500]  And then like, let's say, for instance,
[02:18:56.500 --> 02:18:58.980]  I have 42 plants on a table, right?
[02:18:58.980 --> 02:19:00.780]  Each are in three gallon pots.
[02:19:00.780 --> 02:19:05.780]  So I figure out how many yards of soil there is there.
[02:19:06.580 --> 02:19:09.180]  Right, let's say I have, you know, it's two yards,
[02:19:09.180 --> 02:19:12.660]  it's one yard of soil or something like this theoretically.
[02:19:12.660 --> 02:19:15.460]  I know it's not, it's actually like 1.5,
[02:19:15.460 --> 02:19:18.700]  but let's say it's one yard of soil for that table.
[02:19:18.700 --> 02:19:22.740]  And I have 40 plants.
[02:19:22.740 --> 02:19:27.300]  What I do is if I need to add a cup of calcium per yard,
[02:19:27.300 --> 02:19:29.460]  a cup of magnesium sulfate per yard,
[02:19:29.460 --> 02:19:31.220]  a cup of iron sulfate per yard,
[02:19:31.220 --> 02:19:33.180]  I'll mix all my amendments together.
[02:19:33.180 --> 02:19:37.500]  And then I'll divide the amount that I have in mil,
[02:19:37.500 --> 02:19:41.540]  in by weight by the 40 or by milliliters
[02:19:41.540 --> 02:19:43.100]  by the 40 plants, right?
[02:19:43.100 --> 02:19:44.940]  If I know it's a yard,
[02:19:44.940 --> 02:19:47.300]  I'll mix up whatever amount is for yard.
[02:19:47.300 --> 02:19:50.100]  Then I'll divide either the milliliters or the weight
[02:19:50.100 --> 02:19:52.100]  by the amount of plants.
[02:19:52.620 --> 02:19:53.820]  So you'll literally just take,
[02:19:53.820 --> 02:19:56.660]  if it's like, say it tells you that hypothetically,
[02:19:56.660 --> 02:19:59.620]  you need a teaspoon of gypsum per pot.
[02:19:59.620 --> 02:20:01.580]  So you literally just sprinkle that in
[02:20:01.580 --> 02:20:03.460]  and now just start watering like normal
[02:20:03.460 --> 02:20:04.300]  or do you add this with water?
[02:20:04.300 --> 02:20:05.740]  Yeah, just water like normal.
[02:20:05.740 --> 02:20:07.180]  You just top, just sprinkle that
[02:20:07.180 --> 02:20:08.820]  right on the top of the surface.
[02:20:08.820 --> 02:20:09.820]  Okay.
[02:20:09.820 --> 02:20:11.900]  Or you can even just knock it right off
[02:20:11.900 --> 02:20:15.340]  right at the base of the stem and then just water it in.
[02:20:15.340 --> 02:20:16.780]  Okay, yeah, because some people I don't know
[02:20:16.780 --> 02:20:19.380]  if you add it with water and then poured it in
[02:20:19.380 --> 02:20:20.220]  or you know what I mean?
[02:20:20.220 --> 02:20:23.340]  So for some of the stuff like micronutrients,
[02:20:23.340 --> 02:20:25.700]  like you might only like boron, for instance,
[02:20:25.700 --> 02:20:27.580]  you might only be adding in
[02:20:28.660 --> 02:20:31.700]  one third of a teaspoon per yard, right?
[02:20:31.700 --> 02:20:34.220]  You can't top dress one third of a teaspoon
[02:20:34.220 --> 02:20:35.380]  over a yard of soil.
[02:20:35.380 --> 02:20:36.540]  It's fucking impossible.
[02:20:36.540 --> 02:20:38.300]  That's where I was going with that, yeah.
[02:20:38.300 --> 02:20:39.340]  Trust me, I've tried.
[02:20:39.340 --> 02:20:41.540]  Okay, so what you can do for something like that
[02:20:41.540 --> 02:20:43.540]  is you could either water it in.
[02:20:43.540 --> 02:20:45.940]  Like if you know that, you know,
[02:20:45.940 --> 02:20:49.180]  let's say you have a 60 foot long bed
[02:20:49.180 --> 02:20:50.860]  and you know that it's gonna get,
[02:20:52.140 --> 02:20:54.300]  let's say you know it's 20 yards of soil
[02:20:54.300 --> 02:20:57.600]  and you're gonna use 50 gallons of water to water that bed.
[02:20:57.600 --> 02:21:02.600]  You just add, you know, 0.3 teaspoons times 20 yards.
[02:21:04.780 --> 02:21:06.680]  You know, you end up with like what?
[02:21:09.260 --> 02:21:13.540]  You know, seven and a half teaspoons or whatever of boron.
[02:21:13.540 --> 02:21:15.660]  And then you just water that in evenly
[02:21:15.660 --> 02:21:17.380]  over your soil surface, right?
[02:21:17.380 --> 02:21:19.700]  So you can do micronutrient sulfates like that
[02:21:19.700 --> 02:21:20.780]  because they're water soluble
[02:21:20.780 --> 02:21:23.700]  and you get even distribution over the soil surface.
[02:21:23.700 --> 02:21:25.420]  But for things like that are larger,
[02:21:25.420 --> 02:21:26.580]  like the amino acids,
[02:21:26.580 --> 02:21:29.540]  you're gonna be using probably more potassium sulfate,
[02:21:29.540 --> 02:21:32.420]  the gypsum, iron sulfate.
[02:21:32.420 --> 02:21:34.860]  Those things are typically top dressed
[02:21:34.860 --> 02:21:38.140]  because there's usually a larger volume of them.
[02:21:38.140 --> 02:21:41.580]  And then typically like if you're doing a whole reset
[02:21:41.580 --> 02:21:44.900]  on a bed, you might be doing up to like
[02:21:44.900 --> 02:21:48.380]  maybe a thousand milliliters per yard.
[02:21:48.380 --> 02:21:52.180]  So you might have like four cups total of amendments,
[02:21:52.180 --> 02:21:54.740]  but that's like sufficient to get you
[02:21:54.740 --> 02:21:57.980]  almost through your whole cycle, you know, in a bed.
[02:21:59.780 --> 02:22:00.620]  I got you.
[02:22:00.620 --> 02:22:03.020]  So that's just loading up for the next run basically.
[02:22:03.020 --> 02:22:04.420]  So you can do that too.
[02:22:04.420 --> 02:22:07.320]  So I have levels that were here and adjust to one,
[02:22:08.500 --> 02:22:11.300]  one run or one test at the very beginning
[02:22:11.300 --> 02:22:12.760]  where you just load everything up
[02:22:12.760 --> 02:22:14.180]  cause you know you're putting plants in
[02:22:14.540 --> 02:22:16.300]  that came from like a one gallon, right?
[02:22:16.300 --> 02:22:17.260]  So they're gonna be able to have
[02:22:17.260 --> 02:22:19.660]  a good healthy high nutrition.
[02:22:19.660 --> 02:22:20.980]  You put them in those beds
[02:22:20.980 --> 02:22:23.460]  and then just run your water and your microbes.
[02:22:23.460 --> 02:22:26.320]  You know, do your IPM stuff and your plant maintenance.
[02:22:26.320 --> 02:22:28.360]  And then you're good to go for that whole run.
[02:22:28.360 --> 02:22:30.860]  At the end of that run, you retest
[02:22:30.860 --> 02:22:33.260]  and then you add what needs to be added in again.
[02:22:34.120 --> 02:22:36.780]  So it depends on the system,
[02:22:36.780 --> 02:22:38.620]  but you know, I work with people that have beds
[02:22:38.620 --> 02:22:41.820]  that'll do testing once, you know, at a reset.
[02:22:41.820 --> 02:22:43.860]  Then I have people that are in smaller containers
[02:22:44.540 --> 02:22:46.580]  that'll do bi-weekly like myself.
[02:22:46.580 --> 02:22:49.340]  So it just, and then I have people that'll, you know,
[02:22:49.340 --> 02:22:51.660]  do once a season where they're like,
[02:22:51.660 --> 02:22:54.360]  hey, I need to add this, you know,
[02:22:54.360 --> 02:22:57.260]  this field that I fucking dumped a bunch of shit on,
[02:22:57.260 --> 02:22:58.620]  you know, what do you do to it?
[02:22:58.620 --> 02:23:00.780]  You know, so it works the same way
[02:23:00.780 --> 02:23:03.280]  at just different kind of different approach
[02:23:03.280 --> 02:23:06.500]  with the amount of testing needed.
[02:23:06.500 --> 02:23:09.520]  Obviously a smaller plot pot is gonna,
[02:23:10.440 --> 02:23:14.960]  it's gonna be depleted quicker,
[02:23:14.960 --> 02:23:17.080]  especially if you have larger plants.
[02:23:20.080 --> 02:23:22.120]  That's why not to kind of bring up the same,
[02:23:22.120 --> 02:23:26.680]  but the water only thing, it just kind of blows my mind
[02:23:26.680 --> 02:23:28.040]  that that would be achievable
[02:23:28.040 --> 02:23:31.520]  without building up something first.
[02:23:31.520 --> 02:23:33.160]  No, no, no, it doesn't need to be built up
[02:23:33.160 --> 02:23:35.400]  because here's the thing, all of those minerals
[02:23:35.400 --> 02:23:38.680]  are already in the soil and they're soluble.
[02:23:38.680 --> 02:23:41.560]  So when, and that's what the saturated paste is telling you,
[02:23:41.560 --> 02:23:44.920]  it's telling you exactly what is there.
[02:23:44.920 --> 02:23:47.160]  Now, yes, it is gonna get lower and lower,
[02:23:47.160 --> 02:23:50.140]  but if you're adding it up, that nutrition is,
[02:23:50.140 --> 02:23:55.140]  what is leaving that soil is going into the plant.
[02:23:55.760 --> 02:23:58.400]  And so if it's in that plant,
[02:23:58.400 --> 02:24:01.640]  as long as it doesn't get to a point
[02:24:01.640 --> 02:24:05.040]  where it's no longer a sufficient amount of nutrition,
[02:24:05.040 --> 02:24:06.640]  it's gonna keep doing its thing.
[02:24:07.600 --> 02:24:09.160]  It will run out if it's smaller though.
[02:24:09.160 --> 02:24:11.120]  That is kind of the trick, right?
[02:24:11.120 --> 02:24:14.080]  Some plants need, have higher nutrition.
[02:24:14.080 --> 02:24:16.200]  They may need a slightly bigger pot
[02:24:16.200 --> 02:24:19.860]  or they might need to be reamended faster.
[02:24:20.860 --> 02:24:24.000]  To be able to say true living soil, no matter what,
[02:24:24.000 --> 02:24:28.520]  it's like, well, I can't, you can't grow a four foot plant
[02:24:28.520 --> 02:24:31.480]  in a living soil in a one gallon pot.
[02:24:31.480 --> 02:24:33.560]  I mean, it's probably not gonna work very well, right?
[02:24:33.560 --> 02:24:34.720]  Not just on one run.
[02:24:34.720 --> 02:24:36.400]  You can't say, oh, well, you know,
[02:24:36.400 --> 02:24:39.900]  I've had this one plant in this pot for three months.
[02:24:42.320 --> 02:24:43.160]  It's like-
[02:24:43.160 --> 02:24:45.080]  Truthfully, I've never seen anybody successful
[02:24:45.080 --> 02:24:48.040]  with smaller pots without kind of doing more
[02:24:48.040 --> 02:24:50.720]  of like a hybrid approach.
[02:24:50.720 --> 02:24:52.080]  More of a maintenance, yeah.
[02:24:52.080 --> 02:24:53.960]  Because you have to do more top dressing
[02:24:53.960 --> 02:24:55.400]  if you're in a smaller pot.
[02:24:55.400 --> 02:24:59.320]  You have to make sure that soil stays sufficient.
[02:25:02.150 --> 02:25:04.110]  I got a quick question for you, Brandon.
[02:25:04.110 --> 02:25:05.830]  This is from Blue of Green Tank.
[02:25:06.670 --> 02:25:07.510]  Shout out to Blue.
[02:25:09.190 --> 02:25:12.110]  How often do you apply Bacillus subtilis?
[02:25:12.110 --> 02:25:12.950]  Like how often?
[02:25:12.950 --> 02:25:13.830]  Because I always say, you know,
[02:25:13.830 --> 02:25:16.190]  I don't like to apply too much LAB,
[02:25:16.190 --> 02:25:18.070]  which is lactic acid bacteria.
[02:25:18.070 --> 02:25:19.510]  A little bit different.
[02:25:19.510 --> 02:25:20.950]  How do you run with those
[02:25:20.950 --> 02:25:22.190]  and give us a little bit on that?
[02:25:22.190 --> 02:25:27.070]  Yeah, so if you are using the Micro Plus product,
[02:25:27.070 --> 02:25:29.110]  it has Bacillus subtilis in there.
[02:25:29.110 --> 02:25:31.310]  And I use that product weekly.
[02:25:31.310 --> 02:25:35.190]  I use my Micro Plus once a week.
[02:25:36.150 --> 02:25:38.510]  If you're talking about the Bacillus subtilis
[02:25:38.510 --> 02:25:40.230]  with the Trichoderma combination,
[02:25:41.390 --> 02:25:43.510]  that I would like to use that
[02:25:45.030 --> 02:25:47.390]  at around week three of flower, right?
[02:25:47.390 --> 02:25:49.310]  I spray all of my flowers
[02:25:49.310 --> 02:25:51.390]  with the Trichoderma Bacillus subtilis.
[02:25:51.390 --> 02:25:56.390]  And that is for preventative for Botrytis.
[02:25:59.070 --> 02:26:01.310]  I like that Trichoderma definitely, man.
[02:26:01.310 --> 02:26:03.070]  It's a hell of a-
[02:26:04.070 --> 02:26:09.070]  That soil combination is really, really good in veg too.
[02:26:09.830 --> 02:26:12.270]  That combination of Trichoderma and Bacillus subtilis.
[02:26:12.270 --> 02:26:15.750]  If you were to just do a really heavy inoculation
[02:26:15.750 --> 02:26:19.390]  once in veg, you'll see a really large difference
[02:26:19.390 --> 02:26:21.270]  in the iron uptake.
[02:26:21.270 --> 02:26:22.110]  Okay.
[02:26:22.110 --> 02:26:24.350]  Iron and phosphate.
[02:26:24.350 --> 02:26:29.350]  You'll see phosphate released from inorganic phosphorus
[02:26:30.190 --> 02:26:32.870]  and you'll see a larger,
[02:26:33.950 --> 02:26:38.950]  you'll see a rise in soluble ferrous iron.
[02:26:39.710 --> 02:26:41.230]  Okay. That's good to know.
[02:26:42.270 --> 02:26:43.750]  To help you get out of a deficiency
[02:26:43.750 --> 02:26:46.230]  or get you through for sure.
[02:26:46.230 --> 02:26:48.770]  He had another question, part of his question.
[02:26:49.910 --> 02:26:50.990]  Let's see.
[02:26:50.990 --> 02:26:53.190]  He's heard the best practices
[02:26:53.190 --> 02:26:57.370]  to wake up Bovarya baciana spores.
[02:26:58.330 --> 02:26:59.210]  Yes.
[02:26:59.210 --> 02:27:03.050]  I mean, what I'm usually doing is with any of the spores
[02:27:03.050 --> 02:27:05.010]  that come off of my website,
[02:27:05.010 --> 02:27:07.170]  if you're mixing them into water as a soil drench,
[02:27:07.170 --> 02:27:09.630]  what I'll do is I'll take a water bottle
[02:27:09.630 --> 02:27:10.930]  with some clean water in there
[02:27:10.930 --> 02:27:14.130]  and I'll actually dump the spore into the water first
[02:27:14.130 --> 02:27:16.450]  and I'll shake it up because the spores
[02:27:16.450 --> 02:27:19.130]  are naturally hydrophobic.
[02:27:19.130 --> 02:27:22.230]  They create type of a lipid layer, like a wax coating.
[02:27:23.370 --> 02:27:25.090]  And that's to help preserve themselves.
[02:27:25.090 --> 02:27:28.770]  And so you want to be able to kind of penetrate
[02:27:28.770 --> 02:27:31.850]  and get them wet, right?
[02:27:31.850 --> 02:27:33.570]  So what I'll typically do is I'll sit there
[02:27:33.570 --> 02:27:36.550]  and I'll shake up until everything's really mixed up
[02:27:36.550 --> 02:27:39.670]  in solution and then I'll add it into my reservoir,
[02:27:39.670 --> 02:27:43.290]  rinse out my bottle and then I'll always have like a pump
[02:27:43.290 --> 02:27:46.850]  at the bottom of my res, like circulating water constantly.
[02:27:46.850 --> 02:27:48.530]  And I do that for all minerals.
[02:27:48.530 --> 02:27:50.930]  If I'm adding anything at all in my reservoir,
[02:27:50.930 --> 02:27:52.970]  there's always a mixing pump,
[02:27:52.970 --> 02:27:55.250]  always, no matter what it is.
[02:27:55.250 --> 02:27:58.250]  Yeah, I even do that in a five gallon if I'm just watering,
[02:27:58.250 --> 02:28:00.530]  I keep the pump circulating while I'm adding stuff
[02:28:00.530 --> 02:28:01.490]  just to keep it moving.
[02:28:01.490 --> 02:28:03.090]  That's a good practice.
[02:28:03.090 --> 02:28:05.290]  And on the same lines, I guess what you're,
[02:28:05.290 --> 02:28:07.450]  so basically Bob, we're saying wake up,
[02:28:07.450 --> 02:28:10.450]  you want them just to get that moisture into them.
[02:28:10.450 --> 02:28:12.650]  He had another question with adding saponins
[02:28:12.650 --> 02:28:15.930]  to that water bottle, kind of help that cope faster,
[02:28:15.930 --> 02:28:19.650]  get that moisture hydrophobic state out of there
[02:28:19.650 --> 02:28:21.810]  or doesn't really matter?
[02:28:21.810 --> 02:28:26.130]  So there are some surfactants like Silhouette
[02:28:26.130 --> 02:28:29.010]  that can be used, but I don't typically,
[02:28:29.010 --> 02:28:31.610]  I don't recommend using something like a soap nut
[02:28:31.610 --> 02:28:34.170]  or Kiaha with the biological
[02:28:34.170 --> 02:28:37.410]  because they have natural anti-fungal
[02:28:37.410 --> 02:28:40.290]  and anti-bacterial properties, right?
[02:28:40.290 --> 02:28:42.830]  It's a soap, it's a soap, right?
[02:28:44.410 --> 02:28:46.330]  That's why I thought for surfactants,
[02:28:46.330 --> 02:28:47.570]  the yucca was where it's at
[02:28:47.570 --> 02:28:49.570]  because the yucca would actually get broke down
[02:28:49.570 --> 02:28:50.870]  by the microbes as well.
[02:28:51.890 --> 02:28:57.870]  Well, I think yucca still,
[02:28:58.750 --> 02:29:00.270]  I haven't done a whole lot of research
[02:29:00.270 --> 02:29:04.450]  on the anti-microbial properties of yucca,
[02:29:04.450 --> 02:29:07.030]  but I'm sure yucca has anti-microbial properties
[02:29:07.030 --> 02:29:09.250]  at all as well.
[02:29:09.250 --> 02:29:12.950]  And I think all of those-
[02:29:12.950 --> 02:29:14.830]  Actually, aloe does too.
[02:29:14.830 --> 02:29:17.110]  They all have them in limited amounts
[02:29:17.110 --> 02:29:17.950]  as limited properties too.
[02:29:17.950 --> 02:29:20.070]  So I think it would just be about,
[02:29:20.070 --> 02:29:23.990]  would probably be about dilution,
[02:29:23.990 --> 02:29:28.990]  concentration and effect, right?
[02:29:29.470 --> 02:29:31.570]  That's what it would probably come down to.
[02:29:34.630 --> 02:29:38.430]  So try it, try small, start small, see what happens.
[02:29:38.430 --> 02:29:40.870]  But yeah, that makes sense if it's got that property,
[02:29:40.870 --> 02:29:43.110]  you might not wanna use the surfactant blue.
[02:29:46.060 --> 02:29:48.740]  Yeah, unless it's more with any surfactant.
[02:29:48.740 --> 02:29:50.740]  But hey, we've been on for two and a half hours,
[02:29:50.740 --> 02:29:52.180]  I should probably get going.
[02:29:52.180 --> 02:29:53.020]  Yeah.
[02:29:53.020 --> 02:29:54.500]  Yeah.
[02:29:54.500 --> 02:29:55.620]  Yeah.
[02:29:55.620 --> 02:29:56.620]  I appreciate the time. It's all good.
[02:29:56.620 --> 02:29:58.920]  We appreciate you, my brother, this was good.
[02:30:00.020 --> 02:30:01.180]  Yeah. Definitely.
[02:30:01.180 --> 02:30:05.180]  You guys can, anybody who's listening can find my IG
[02:30:05.180 --> 02:30:08.920]  at the same screen name right here, russ.brandon.
[02:30:08.920 --> 02:30:13.700]  And there's a link in my bio on my IG page,
[02:30:13.700 --> 02:30:16.020]  and that links to Bokashi Earthworks.
[02:30:16.020 --> 02:30:18.980]  And there's also a web link in my bio.
[02:30:18.980 --> 02:30:20.140]  Yeah, you can check out my products,
[02:30:20.140 --> 02:30:22.460]  microbes, fertilizers, anything like that.
[02:30:23.460 --> 02:30:26.460]  Everything's actually on sale right now.
[02:30:26.460 --> 02:30:27.300]  Yeah, I saw that.
[02:30:27.300 --> 02:30:29.060]  What are you 30% off, aren't you?
[02:30:29.060 --> 02:30:30.100]  I think I saw that.
[02:30:30.100 --> 02:30:34.020]  30% off of carbon-based fertilizers,
[02:30:34.020 --> 02:30:36.380]  50% off microbes spores,
[02:30:36.380 --> 02:30:41.380]  and the microbe plus liters are $19.99 right now.
[02:30:43.620 --> 02:30:44.460]  Nice.
[02:30:44.460 --> 02:30:46.340]  They're usually $24.99, so that's like,
[02:30:47.860 --> 02:30:51.220]  I don't know, 18% off on that or something like that.
[02:30:51.260 --> 02:30:53.380]  It's a deal, that's all that matters.
[02:30:53.380 --> 02:30:54.220]  Yeah.
[02:30:54.220 --> 02:30:55.780]  So get them when you can,
[02:30:55.780 --> 02:30:58.260]  and if you're watching the replay, hurry,
[02:30:58.260 --> 02:30:59.780]  because this is live right now.
[02:30:59.780 --> 02:31:01.780]  Yeah, and one thing, in his story,
[02:31:01.780 --> 02:31:03.540]  there's a link to his Dropbox.
[02:31:03.540 --> 02:31:06.380]  I just went in there, go to his latest story on IG,
[02:31:06.380 --> 02:31:08.220]  and you can get this Dropbox link,
[02:31:08.220 --> 02:31:11.460]  and I call it his little treasure trove box.
[02:31:11.460 --> 02:31:12.780]  All kinds of info in there.
[02:31:12.780 --> 02:31:14.420]  I put, every once in a while,
[02:31:14.420 --> 02:31:17.780]  I'll put some stuff in there, some new articles and stuff.
[02:31:17.780 --> 02:31:20.460]  Nobody's sharing stuff like this, folks.
[02:31:20.500 --> 02:31:21.660]  Respect this man.
[02:31:21.660 --> 02:31:24.820]  This is good stuff he's sharing here with us.
[02:31:24.820 --> 02:31:27.580]  Yeah, and I too love the Instagram rants.
[02:31:27.580 --> 02:31:28.420]  I'll second that.
[02:31:28.420 --> 02:31:32.060]  I love following you, so everybody do give him a follow.
[02:31:33.260 --> 02:31:35.340]  Yeah, appreciate the time.
[02:31:35.340 --> 02:31:37.780]  I'll keep the housekeeping quick.
[02:31:37.780 --> 02:31:41.620]  Brian's back tomorrow with Leighton, correct?
[02:31:41.620 --> 02:31:42.780]  That's correct.
[02:31:42.780 --> 02:31:44.340]  All right.
[02:31:44.340 --> 02:31:45.300]  Cool.
[02:31:45.300 --> 02:31:48.300]  All right, I'll talk to you guys soon.
[02:31:48.300 --> 02:31:49.140]  See you, Brandon.
[02:31:49.140 --> 02:31:50.220]  Appreciate your time, buddy.
[02:31:50.220 --> 02:31:51.540]  Thank you, buddy.
[02:31:53.660 --> 02:31:54.500]  All right.
[02:31:54.500 --> 02:31:56.500]  And if you guys want to check out,
[02:31:56.500 --> 02:31:59.660]  he's gracious with his time on a variety of other podcasts,
[02:31:59.660 --> 02:32:01.140]  so just check him out.
[02:32:01.140 --> 02:32:03.740]  Google his name and check out his stuff,
[02:32:03.740 --> 02:32:06.180]  because I think he's able to drop a variety
[02:32:06.180 --> 02:32:10.020]  of different gold nuggets on a variety of, obviously, topics.
[02:32:10.020 --> 02:32:13.220]  And different podcasters are asking him different questions,
[02:32:13.220 --> 02:32:16.420]  so if you've never seen him,
[02:32:16.420 --> 02:32:18.340]  he was part of the Hustle and Educate
[02:32:18.340 --> 02:32:20.140]  where Marco even broke things down,
[02:32:21.060 --> 02:32:22.900]  so if you do have some time on your hands,
[02:32:22.900 --> 02:32:25.700]  it's well worth it to listen to these gentlemen, for sure.
[02:32:25.700 --> 02:32:28.660]  Yeah, that's where, yeah, the Hustle and Educate,
[02:32:28.660 --> 02:32:30.380]  it was crazy, because I went on first,
[02:32:30.380 --> 02:32:31.740]  and I felt like I did okay,
[02:32:31.740 --> 02:32:33.580]  and then when this man came out,
[02:32:33.580 --> 02:32:36.540]  I was really just enamored like everybody else,
[02:32:36.540 --> 02:32:38.940]  and taking notes, and, you know, like, man,
[02:32:38.940 --> 02:32:40.180]  it's like he's one of those guys,
[02:32:40.180 --> 02:32:41.620]  no matter what level you're on,
[02:32:41.620 --> 02:32:44.060]  you can always learn something from a guy like that, man,
[02:32:44.060 --> 02:32:46.380]  so much respect to him for coming on,
[02:32:46.380 --> 02:32:48.300]  and it was short notice,
[02:32:48.340 --> 02:32:50.660]  so y'all can hit him up in his DM,
[02:32:50.660 --> 02:32:52.020]  tell him you watched him on the show,
[02:32:52.020 --> 02:32:54.060]  and you appreciate what he did for us.
[02:32:55.580 --> 02:32:57.380]  Absolutely, and everybody,
[02:32:57.380 --> 02:32:59.300]  I am writing down your questions,
[02:32:59.300 --> 02:33:01.100]  so we had some questions,
[02:33:01.100 --> 02:33:02.860]  but really, go and check out his Instagram,
[02:33:02.860 --> 02:33:04.060]  because a lot of these questions
[02:33:04.060 --> 02:33:05.620]  can probably be answered there.
[02:33:06.500 --> 02:33:07.740]  The guy gives it away,
[02:33:07.740 --> 02:33:09.820]  I know I'm not the only one filling out,
[02:33:09.820 --> 02:33:13.660]  you know, notebook pages today, everybody else, you know.
[02:33:13.660 --> 02:33:16.820]  Yep, so everybody out there in chat doing the same.
[02:33:16.820 --> 02:33:20.980]  Yep, hey, man, you know, the taxi driver wisdom,
[02:33:20.980 --> 02:33:23.900]  a smart person can see what's smart about the next person.
[02:33:23.900 --> 02:33:24.740]  So.
[02:33:24.740 --> 02:33:25.580]  Definitely.
[02:33:25.580 --> 02:33:27.140]  And then you can learn, yep.
[02:33:27.140 --> 02:33:30.020]  So it goes on, but I'll leave it there.
[02:33:31.660 --> 02:33:35.780]  Yeah, housekeeping, we've got some more shows coming up.
[02:33:35.780 --> 02:33:38.860]  I know Saturday I will be back
[02:33:38.860 --> 02:33:41.700]  with the Perfectly Imperfect Grow Show.
[02:33:42.700 --> 02:33:44.700]  We got our flyer right there.
[02:33:45.100 --> 02:33:46.620]  The Island Boys.
[02:33:46.620 --> 02:33:47.460]  Hey.
[02:33:49.100 --> 02:33:51.540]  Catch us Saturday, two o'clock.
[02:33:51.540 --> 02:33:52.980]  Look at that little dagger,
[02:33:52.980 --> 02:33:54.620]  you put that little dagger part in there.
[02:33:54.620 --> 02:33:55.460]  Yep.
[02:33:56.380 --> 02:33:59.900]  Oh, that's supreme right there, supreme dagger.
[02:33:59.900 --> 02:34:02.260]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:34:02.260 --> 02:34:05.300]  And, you know, tying it all together on dagger,
[02:34:05.300 --> 02:34:08.180]  Brandon Russ, we've got an option up there for you
[02:34:08.180 --> 02:34:10.420]  right now, it's the Limelight F2,
[02:34:10.420 --> 02:34:13.020]  Limerilla times, what is it?
[02:34:13.060 --> 02:34:14.660]  MACV2.
[02:34:14.660 --> 02:34:16.620]  So that's F2, that's up on dagger.
[02:34:16.620 --> 02:34:17.580]  That's what we should talk to him
[02:34:17.580 --> 02:34:19.140]  about another day as well, Marco,
[02:34:19.140 --> 02:34:21.460]  is his genetics and what he likes to run.
[02:34:21.460 --> 02:34:24.580]  Because he's pretty early in the game, man,
[02:34:24.580 --> 02:34:27.620]  for this many people to just be rocking his own stuff.
[02:34:27.620 --> 02:34:28.900]  Yeah.
[02:34:28.900 --> 02:34:29.740]  Yeah, so.
[02:34:29.740 --> 02:34:31.260]  A lot of people are rocking his stuff,
[02:34:31.260 --> 02:34:33.500]  his stuff looks fire, I mean, obviously,
[02:34:33.500 --> 02:34:35.500]  but yeah, man, we didn't even get into the breeding,
[02:34:35.500 --> 02:34:37.020]  that man has so much to offer.
[02:34:37.020 --> 02:34:40.300]  We could do another whole show with him, you know.
[02:34:40.300 --> 02:34:42.820]  Shows, at least another couple of notebooks worth.
[02:34:43.620 --> 02:34:46.380]  I see Peter here, he sent me something new,
[02:34:46.380 --> 02:34:47.780]  which will be up in a day or two.
[02:34:47.780 --> 02:34:52.340]  So I guess check that out and find out what that is.
[02:34:52.340 --> 02:34:54.660]  There we go, make it a little bit bigger there.
[02:34:54.660 --> 02:34:55.660]  Right on.
[02:34:55.660 --> 02:34:56.500]  Yep.
[02:34:56.500 --> 02:34:58.500]  Just the fact that all this content exists, man,
[02:34:58.500 --> 02:35:00.380]  and you know, not everything is for everybody,
[02:35:00.380 --> 02:35:02.420]  but it definitely seems like it's resonating
[02:35:02.420 --> 02:35:04.380]  with the majority of people that,
[02:35:05.740 --> 02:35:08.420]  hopefully also to Mr. Westport,
[02:35:08.420 --> 02:35:10.740]  that there is something to this, man.
[02:35:10.740 --> 02:35:12.620]  And there's something magical about just
[02:35:13.420 --> 02:35:14.740]  the microbial world.
[02:35:14.740 --> 02:35:15.580]  Yeah.
[02:35:15.580 --> 02:35:16.780]  Yes, definitely.
[02:35:16.780 --> 02:35:18.380]  It's a growing world.
[02:35:18.380 --> 02:35:22.220]  Yeah, stay tuned here, you'll find out.
[02:35:22.220 --> 02:35:24.060]  With that, we'll wrap it up.
[02:35:24.060 --> 02:35:26.060]  Yep, we'll wrap it up for this week
[02:35:26.060 --> 02:35:29.380]  and we'll be back next week with the Brian and Marco show.
[02:35:30.300 --> 02:35:31.660]  Thank you all.
[02:35:31.660 --> 02:35:32.500]  Thank you, Peter.
