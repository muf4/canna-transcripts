[00:05.310 --> 00:10.670]  A layer mitigates moisture from the top to the bottom and vice versa through
[00:10.670 --> 00:15.290]  wicking. So if you over water you got a place to store the water if your pot
[00:15.290 --> 00:20.150]  starts to dry out the A layer will actually wick the moisture out of the
[00:20.150 --> 00:25.790]  layer back up into the overriding. So you maintain a regular soil moisture. It
[00:25.790 --> 00:32.670]  really takes the difficult task of maintaining a constant or similar
[00:32.670 --> 00:37.890]  moisture throughout your entire soil profile. So it's a little bit it's a way
[00:37.890 --> 00:42.830]  of buffering watering and watering got to be one of the biggest issues that
[00:42.830 --> 00:48.110]  I've seen in the cannabis community. It's either underwater or over watered. The
[00:48.110 --> 00:54.390]  material if it's above ground and pots the potting soil will go hydrophobic. So
[00:54.390 --> 00:59.610]  that means that it basically will not accept water and basically what that is
[00:59.610 --> 01:04.770]  is that the bacteria has gone in what's called a cyst form. And so what cyst
[01:04.770 --> 01:09.770]  means is that it basically goes dormant. Suspended animation would be another way
[01:09.770 --> 01:15.530]  of describing it. But it creates a shell around the outside of it that allows the
[01:15.530 --> 01:23.050]  inside organism to stay alive not consume any oxygen or moisture and
[01:23.050 --> 01:27.970]  actually it actually prevents moisture. So it's it's kind of like a wax coating
[01:27.970 --> 01:33.530]  around it. And the bacteria do this on a scale which is called biofilm. So you can
[01:33.530 --> 01:39.330]  imagine if there's a you know a good bacterial population in your soil then
[01:39.330 --> 01:45.970]  if they all go cyst form basically you can't get water in anymore. So it becomes
[01:45.970 --> 01:51.090]  really problematic you know in that situation. And so another thing that I
[01:51.090 --> 01:54.450]  introduced to the to the industry as a whole is if you are going to be in pots
[01:54.570 --> 01:59.330]  or beds that you should cover crop. And this goes back to the understanding that
[01:59.330 --> 02:05.170]  in a living soil system you never want bare soil. You always want to have
[02:05.170 --> 02:09.690]  something growing in it. And even if this is an indoor grow in your basement that
[02:09.690 --> 02:12.850]  you only do during the winter you still should keep on low light and
[02:12.850 --> 02:16.850]  periodically water it and keep something alive. Otherwise it's going to dry out and
[02:16.850 --> 02:20.770]  then when you start over again you're going to have to get them get everything
[02:20.930 --> 02:25.410]  back up and running which takes time. So instead of instead of wasting all that
[02:25.410 --> 02:31.450]  extra energy doing that you just simply maintain it even at low light and just
[02:31.450 --> 02:35.850]  periodically water it so that you maintain that plant life in that system
[02:35.850 --> 02:40.810]  throughout the course of the year. Now another thing that's kind of been a big
[02:40.810 --> 02:46.730]  misnomer in the industry is mycorrhizae fungi. That's why I have my my good
[02:46.730 --> 02:49.970]  friends Craig and Leif on the show to talk about that at the point and
[02:49.970 --> 02:56.290]  saprophytic fungi which pretty much equal about 50% of the overall nutrient
[02:56.290 --> 03:03.250]  cycling system. They're critical in both building micro and macro aggregates as
[03:03.250 --> 03:08.050]  well as mining materials for your plant. Hey Peter you're back.
[03:08.050 --> 03:23.810]  I yeah I was for some weird reason so carry on and the YouTube. All right
[03:23.810 --> 03:29.250]  carrying on I will. So another thing is that mycorrhizae. So in order to
[03:29.250 --> 03:33.970]  understand what mycorrhizae does we're gonna go down a brief rabbit hole. So
[03:33.970 --> 03:41.610]  basically this particular fungi create an association with the plant directly.
[03:41.610 --> 03:48.850]  So by that I mean that it actually infects the plant root and creates a
[03:48.850 --> 03:55.610]  connection to that plant and that plant in turn feeds it. And then the job of the
[03:55.610 --> 04:02.250]  mycorrhizae is to go out and mine sandstone clay and rock for actual
[04:02.250 --> 04:07.970]  nutrients that the plant is requesting. So it's a really cool association that
[04:07.970 --> 04:13.810]  is not really well understood among the masses. And so people that use a
[04:13.810 --> 04:18.890]  mycorrhizae fungi in a potting soil is there's there's not going to be
[04:18.890 --> 04:24.890]  association that that's beneficial to the plant. The mycorrhizae will continue
[04:24.890 --> 04:30.490]  to search through all of that material using energy from the plant to go out
[04:30.490 --> 04:36.490]  and find what the plant wants. And so it's not parasitic but it's not really
[04:36.490 --> 04:41.290]  beneficial to the plant unless you have those materials the sandstone clay and
[04:41.290 --> 04:47.050]  rock that are put into this horizontal soil system. The other misnomer is people
[04:47.050 --> 04:51.530]  think that the association happens really quickly. Well the truth of it is
[04:51.530 --> 04:57.090]  it generally takes about 90 days for that association from the infection to
[04:57.090 --> 05:01.810]  the point where that mycorrhizae actually has nutrients to mine. It takes
[05:01.810 --> 05:07.130]  about 90 days. So if you're in a traditional cannabis grow you're not
[05:07.130 --> 05:13.370]  going to have 90 days before you harvest the plant. So this again is why it's
[05:13.370 --> 05:18.530]  really important to never take your root ball out of the soil if you have
[05:18.530 --> 05:24.450]  mycorrhizae and better yet inoculate your new plants as you plant them so
[05:24.530 --> 05:29.130]  that they can instantly join that association that's going on in the
[05:29.130 --> 05:37.130]  bed or the pot. And another interesting thing about this too is that a 90 I
[05:37.130 --> 05:41.810]  believe percent of plants on the planet have some kind of mycorrhizae
[05:41.810 --> 05:48.570]  association and in with the last few years it has been now formally
[05:48.610 --> 05:54.450]  documented in white papers that it's kind of a lot more complex than we
[05:54.450 --> 05:57.930]  originally thought. We originally thought it was just flowing phosphorous. Well in
[05:57.930 --> 06:03.090]  reality it's flowing potassium, nitrogen, all the macro and micro nutrients and
[06:03.090 --> 06:07.410]  even more interestingly enough is it associating with all the plants that you
[06:07.410 --> 06:14.170]  have present in your living soil system. So it can actually take potassium from
[06:14.170 --> 06:19.090]  this plant, trade it to the cannabis plant, the cannabis plant in turn sends back some
[06:19.090 --> 06:23.730]  calcium because it has excess. So there's this incredible association that's going
[06:23.730 --> 06:30.570]  on in that living environment. And again all the more reason to never let your
[06:30.570 --> 06:37.490]  plant beds or pots go bare because that that association will end and you will
[06:37.490 --> 06:43.210]  be forced to start all over again. So you know these are just a couple of the
[06:43.810 --> 06:48.730]  really important parts of understanding living soils. Then we'll get into
[06:48.730 --> 06:54.010]  understanding bacteria a little bit more. So each bacteria and their communities
[06:54.010 --> 06:59.210]  because don't think of them as individuals, will work together in
[06:59.210 --> 07:05.610]  combination and take sand, silt, clay and bond them together with their biofilm.
[07:05.610 --> 07:11.170]  And that's what we call a micro aggregate. And then as the biology or the
[07:11.170 --> 07:15.650]  bacteria continue to grow and make more biofilm, that aggregate becomes bigger
[07:15.650 --> 07:20.130]  and bigger to the point where it becomes a macro aggregate. So why are aggregates
[07:20.130 --> 07:25.330]  so important? Well this is the key to healthy soil. If you walk out into the
[07:25.330 --> 07:30.610]  forest, in virgin forest or that has not been disturbed for a long period of time,
[07:30.610 --> 07:35.650]  if you go around trees you can literally just stick your hand down into the duff
[07:35.690 --> 07:41.410]  into the soil. And that's because it's aggregated. And so keeping that in mind
[07:41.410 --> 07:47.610]  that it's it's it's very easy to to stick something down into it. You begin
[07:47.610 --> 07:53.130]  to understand that that also means that it has a great gas exchange. So that
[07:53.130 --> 07:58.890]  means the CO2 is allowed to come out of the soil. The bacteria are going to
[07:58.890 --> 08:03.930]  consume oxygen and release CO2. So the CO2 is allowed to come out and of course
[08:03.930 --> 08:12.890]  the air is allowed to go back in and again feed oxygen to those bacteria. If
[08:12.890 --> 08:18.610]  you do not have that aggregation you end up with what's called compacted soil. And
[08:18.610 --> 08:23.170]  compacted soil not only doesn't respirate or have a good gas exchange
[08:23.170 --> 08:27.810]  but it also does not have good infiltration. And by infiltration I mean
[08:27.810 --> 08:33.570]  allowing water in. So as soon as the soil does not allow water in you get
[08:33.570 --> 08:38.490]  erosion. And erosion is basically taking away that top layer of soil that you
[08:38.490 --> 08:43.130]  just worked so hard to get. I'm living out here in Oxnard California and when
[08:43.130 --> 08:47.730]  the Santa Ana's kicked in the sky darkened. Basically that was all of those
[08:47.730 --> 08:55.090]  fields, their topsoil being blown off into the atmosphere. So it's back to
[08:55.130 --> 09:00.330]  the old dust bowl thing again. And so you're never going to be able to stop
[09:00.330 --> 09:08.210]  that kind of cycle and prevent erosion unless you have cover crops. Again no
[09:08.210 --> 09:12.930]  soil should be left there especially if you're trying to do a living soil system.
[09:12.930 --> 09:17.410]  If you're farming with NPK then really doesn't matter you're just pounding the
[09:17.410 --> 09:22.210]  plant with you know the basic macronutrients. But then now you're going
[09:22.210 --> 09:26.250]  to be forced to deal with a sick plant. It's going to require pesticides and
[09:26.250 --> 09:30.690]  herbicides. Herbicides obviously to prevent other plants from stealing the
[09:30.690 --> 09:36.770]  nutrients you just paid so much for. But that is just a horrible cycle of putting
[09:36.770 --> 09:42.090]  all these nutrients that you really don't need into a soil system. The soil
[09:42.090 --> 09:46.570]  system is compact so every time it rains it washes away or every time you have a
[09:46.570 --> 09:52.650]  real bad windstorm everything is being blown away. Most people don't understand
[09:52.650 --> 09:57.770]  that soils for the most part are built through transportation. So that means
[09:57.770 --> 10:03.490]  wind or erosion. And so it takes thousands of years sometimes maybe even
[10:03.490 --> 10:08.250]  millions of years for these soils to become fertile. And then when you log
[10:08.250 --> 10:14.170]  them, mow them down and plow them and then plant them you've just you've just
[10:14.170 --> 10:19.850]  taken those soils back to zero. And that takes a long time to start rebuilding
[10:19.850 --> 10:25.930]  them back up to a living soil system. So there's a lot of tricks to this. I've
[10:25.930 --> 10:29.890]  been working across the country on different engineered soils. So engineered
[10:29.890 --> 10:37.410]  soils are generally high performance sports turfs. So generally they're 98 to
[10:37.410 --> 10:43.450]  99 percent sand with a fraction of organic matter and very little clay or
[10:43.450 --> 10:49.370]  silt. And the reason why is they don't want these systems to compact and they
[10:49.370 --> 10:54.530]  want to allow the games, the sports, whether it's golf, football, soccer to
[10:54.530 --> 10:58.970]  happen year-round even in even in the rain. And if there was a lot of organic
[10:58.970 --> 11:04.550]  matter then those soils would become unstable and the guys would be sinking
[11:04.550 --> 11:09.190]  in mud and it would be getting ripped up by their cleats. So it's a
[11:09.190 --> 11:14.870]  problematic, it's a dichotomy between how do you get a sports field that you can
[11:14.870 --> 11:19.790]  play on and all different types of weather and still maintain any kind of
[11:19.790 --> 11:25.150]  life. So I was called into a number of projects. I've done everything from the
[11:25.150 --> 11:30.270]  St. Louis Arches rooftop gardens, a ton of different parks in New York,
[11:30.270 --> 11:36.710]  Massachusetts and even in some in New Jersey as well as some major sports
[11:36.710 --> 11:43.310]  franchises which I don't want to talk about right on live here. But bottom line
[11:43.310 --> 11:48.190]  is I make a series of different types of biological products that will actually
[11:48.190 --> 11:56.070]  take that sand and create a rich layer of humates that do not interfere with
[11:56.070 --> 12:05.470]  the structural of the sand. So and basically this is enough that
[12:05.470 --> 12:13.110]  allows the biology to actually take hold and this in turn allows the reduction of
[12:13.110 --> 12:18.230]  nitrates and ammonium nitrates to be used. And the problem that most people
[12:18.230 --> 12:22.590]  don't understand is that if you're feeding ammonia you're gonna have
[12:22.590 --> 12:27.310]  to use excess water so that for the bacteria to break the ammonia down they
[12:27.310 --> 12:32.870]  need to consume water. The opposite is true with nitrates fertilizers, nitrate
[12:32.870 --> 12:39.230]  and nitrogens. Those require, believe it or not, a carbon. So what happens is if
[12:39.230 --> 12:44.350]  you have a high-performance sports turf field that is made of 99% sand and 1%
[12:44.350 --> 12:49.390]  organic matter and you're feeding a nitrate or nitro a nitrogen fertilizer
[12:49.390 --> 12:56.590]  the bacteria actually have to consume that organic matter to use to break that
[12:56.590 --> 13:00.710]  nitrogen down and make it available for the plant. So you're actually degrading
[13:00.710 --> 13:06.070]  your soils even more. And this just gets compounded and compounded. If you do
[13:06.070 --> 13:10.470]  not have the fungi excreting what's called glomulin, you don't have the
[13:10.470 --> 13:17.830]  bacteria excreting their biofilms, then those particles begin to break
[13:17.830 --> 13:24.790]  apart, compact, again don't let infiltration, don't let oxygen down and
[13:24.790 --> 13:29.750]  carbon CO2 out. So it really gets very very complicated and this system pretty
[13:29.750 --> 13:34.270]  much goes into a tailspin relatively quickly. So that's why I would
[13:34.270 --> 13:39.350]  get involved in these projects is to start to build some tilt that did not
[13:39.350 --> 13:45.230]  affect the structure of it that would allow for the biology to be used and the
[13:45.230 --> 13:51.990]  reduction of course of nitrate nitrogen and ammonia based fertilizers. So that's
[13:51.990 --> 13:57.870]  kind of how I ended up here and I've done a number of really complex high-end
[13:57.870 --> 14:02.710]  landscapes and I pretty much burned out because what would happen is I would
[14:02.710 --> 14:06.070]  spend nine months building these systems, engineering the soil, getting all the
[14:06.070 --> 14:10.510]  biology in place, everything from the saprophytic and mycorrhizal fungi through
[14:10.510 --> 14:15.670]  the entire bacterial kingdom as well as the protozoa kingdom, nematodes and
[14:15.670 --> 14:20.790]  everything. And an organic land care company would roll up and next thing I
[14:20.790 --> 14:23.670]  know a bunch of guys would be jumping out with backpack sprayers and spraying
[14:23.670 --> 14:27.830]  fungicides because someone saw a mushroom. And so they would set this
[14:27.830 --> 14:31.110]  system all the way back and I'd have to go back to the client and say you
[14:31.110 --> 14:35.670]  know we agreed that this was going to remain organic and now I'm gonna be
[14:35.670 --> 14:39.750]  required to make a whole bunch of more inoculants and reapply over the entire
[14:39.790 --> 14:45.790]  property. And so it just it just got into a tailspin. So I was doing a podcast
[14:45.790 --> 14:50.550]  about four or five years ago one of the person that listened to it called me up
[14:50.550 --> 14:55.390]  and said hey I'm in the cannabis industry we have a lot of issues with
[14:55.390 --> 15:02.150]  what's called bro science. So a lot of misnomers like cow mag deficiencies and
[15:02.150 --> 15:07.910]  you know just throw Epsom salts at it and all these other you know foolish
[15:07.910 --> 15:13.350]  mistakes that people were doing on scale because of social media. And so I
[15:13.350 --> 15:18.710]  agreed to start talking with him at length and at one point or another he
[15:18.710 --> 15:22.550]  he said we should do a podcast and I was like you know to be honest with you it's
[15:22.550 --> 15:29.150]  a lot easier to you know meet people and do it in a conference setting so you can
[15:29.150 --> 15:32.750]  feel their energy they can feel your energy and I just don't think you get
[15:32.750 --> 15:37.390]  that with a podcast. So we ended up starting a conference like I said four
[15:37.390 --> 15:45.190]  years ago yeah four years ago now. And that began my national educational push
[15:45.190 --> 15:51.590]  across the country we did shows on the East Coast Maine Michigan in the middle
[15:51.590 --> 15:57.630]  of the US and then a couple on the coast out here California and BC. And really
[15:57.630 --> 16:01.910]  had a lot of fun with it and met a lot of people and began to really kind of
[16:01.910 --> 16:09.550]  give the industry some real solid science and how to on growing without
[16:09.550 --> 16:15.070]  synthetics. And since then a lot of the people who have gone this way have begun
[16:15.070 --> 16:20.910]  to realize that their cannabis plant is actually expressing some of the minor
[16:20.910 --> 16:25.830]  cannabinoids and cannabinoids and terpenes that they ordinarily didn't
[16:25.830 --> 16:31.990]  when they were using just a synthetic fertilizer system. And so you know the
[16:31.990 --> 16:35.390]  other misnomer I hear a lot oh well I'm not gonna go living soils because I'm
[16:35.390 --> 16:41.110]  gonna lose my yield. And that's not true in a truly diverse complete living soil
[16:41.110 --> 16:46.230]  system you are actually going to be at the same if not a little bit more in
[16:46.230 --> 16:51.630]  your overall weight. But again this is based on lighting there's there's a lot
[16:51.670 --> 16:58.590]  to this. You know vapor pressure deficit, soil moisture, all these things can
[16:58.590 --> 17:03.390]  affect the production of your plants. So it's not a matter of just measuring EC
[17:03.390 --> 17:07.590]  and dumping in more or realizing you have new lock and flushing it all out
[17:07.590 --> 17:12.950]  into the into the sewer systems. There's a little bit more nuance to this so it
[17:12.950 --> 17:18.190]  requires soil chemistry testing at the beginning and at the end of every run as
[17:18.230 --> 17:22.710]  well as periodic checkups with a microscope to determine what level of
[17:22.710 --> 17:27.830]  advanced biology you have present. So I'm going to talk a little bit more about
[17:27.830 --> 17:32.990]  you know the advanced biology. So pretty much all soils will have bacteria that's
[17:32.990 --> 17:40.470]  a no-brainer. Same with all compost. But in order to make those bacteria plant
[17:40.470 --> 17:44.750]  available you need to you need to kill them. You need something to consume them.
[17:44.790 --> 17:51.030]  So there's basically three types of protists or protozoa. One is a flagellate.
[17:51.030 --> 17:56.150]  It basically has two flagellum one sticking out of each end of it and it
[17:56.150 --> 18:01.070]  wobbles in the soil. And so these guys wobble around they'll often you'll often
[18:01.070 --> 18:06.950]  see them use one of their flagellum to to capture a micro aggregate and then it
[18:06.950 --> 18:11.990]  will munch on it and as it munches on it it releases those bacteria plant
[18:12.030 --> 18:15.670]  available. And you know let me back up a little bit on bacteria. See the other
[18:15.670 --> 18:20.750]  misnomer is that the bacteria has only got one thing in it. Well that's not true.
[18:20.750 --> 18:24.910]  The bacteria has a pantry. So it has all these different things that it's mined
[18:24.910 --> 18:29.350]  out of the soil or whichever part it's looking for whether it's sand silt or
[18:29.350 --> 18:34.190]  clay organic matter. And it puts those nutrients in its pantry so that if their
[18:34.190 --> 18:41.230]  pH has changed or the humidity changes or the barometric pressure changes it
[18:41.270 --> 18:49.590]  can actually modify the enzymes and fluids inside itself to to to better
[18:49.590 --> 18:54.430]  prepare itself for the living environment. And so when that protozoa
[18:54.430 --> 19:00.510]  eats it that entire pantry is made available to the plant itself. Ed had
[19:00.510 --> 19:04.310]  just mentioned there's some questions so I'm gonna go ahead and open up the floor.
[19:04.310 --> 19:09.630]  Peter you want or Peter you Ed you want to pull them up on the stage?
[19:09.630 --> 19:22.120]  Sure I can I can invite a couple people to speak here. I'm doing it right now. Or
[19:22.120 --> 19:26.320]  you know if anyone else just wants to speak I see that we have two more
[19:26.320 --> 19:32.480]  another one down here and I'm putting them up now. Great. And we have
[19:32.480 --> 19:37.840]  Ethan. Ethan did you have a question you had for Leighton? Yeah thanks so much for
[19:37.840 --> 19:41.840]  this room Leighton. I was in a room with you a couple weeks ago talking about the
[19:41.840 --> 19:47.160]  soil project I'm doing in East Boston so it's good to get even more
[19:47.160 --> 19:52.440]  information and Peter I'm a big fan of the future cannabis project so it's I'm
[19:52.440 --> 19:58.800]  really glad you're hosting this room. My quick question was in terms of cannabis
[19:58.800 --> 20:05.640]  for hobbyist growing here in you know either New England Massachusetts or
[20:05.640 --> 20:11.360]  Vermont how do you make the decision about whether to plant into native soil?
[20:11.880 --> 20:18.960]  If you're going into the ground or you know dig a hole and create a you know
[20:18.960 --> 20:23.680]  soil the system the horizon system you were talking about how do you how do you
[20:23.680 --> 20:30.800]  how do you assess that? Oh that's a great question Ethan thanks for asking that.
[20:30.800 --> 20:36.760]  Basically it starts with a series of tests so I'm called in on a project
[20:36.760 --> 20:41.960]  we'll call it a hemp grow so it's some serious acreage. The first thing I'll do
[20:41.960 --> 20:47.400]  is I'll do what's called a pit test so I bring in a backhoe or an excavator and I
[20:47.400 --> 20:51.880]  dig down to view the soil profiles and what I'm looking for is compaction
[20:51.880 --> 20:58.680]  layers or anaerobic layers so those will instantly appear as a black line you
[20:58.680 --> 21:04.960]  know horizontally across the soil. It's called plow pan, hard pan, there's a
[21:04.960 --> 21:09.280]  number of different names for it but basically that's my limitation so I know
[21:09.280 --> 21:14.640]  if I'm growing a hemp plant from seed we're gonna have deep rooting we're
[21:14.640 --> 21:18.640]  gonna have a top root and when that top root which is in charge of pulling all
[21:18.640 --> 21:23.160]  of the nutrients for the most part goes down and hits that anaerobic layer it's
[21:23.160 --> 21:28.080]  going to melt the root tip and it can't go any further so you've really limited
[21:28.080 --> 21:34.840]  yourself to the size and potential yield of that that plant. So that's the
[21:34.840 --> 21:40.120]  first one and then I will do soil chemistry test, I will do a textural test
[21:40.120 --> 21:48.640]  and I'll do organic matter test and often a CEC test and a saturated paste
[21:48.640 --> 21:54.600]  test. So with all those tests I can begin to assemble what is the nutritional value
[21:54.600 --> 22:00.960]  of that soil and then that helps me decide what to amend or what to use as a
[22:01.000 --> 22:07.880]  cover crop to get that soil ready to actually run this cash crop. Another test
[22:07.880 --> 22:11.560]  that I will do is what's called an infiltration test which is a simple
[22:11.560 --> 22:16.680]  little test of basically taking a ring pounding it down into the soil pouring
[22:16.680 --> 22:21.960]  water into the top of it and watching how long it takes that water to get down
[22:21.960 --> 22:26.360]  into the soil system. If it's very quick then I know I have a very biologically
[22:26.400 --> 22:30.560]  active soil because again macro and micro aggregates are the key to
[22:30.560 --> 22:36.320]  everything. Some of the crazier deeper stuff on redox potential, bottom line
[22:36.320 --> 22:39.680]  they'll still come out and say the only way we can really measure this is by
[22:39.680 --> 22:46.080]  good aggregation. So now I have my infiltration test, I have determined if I
[22:46.080 --> 22:51.360]  have an anaerobic layer or a compaction zone, I have all my soil chemistry and my
[22:51.360 --> 22:57.240]  workups on the profile of the textural as well as organic matter CEC and saturated
[22:57.240 --> 23:02.160]  paste test. Now I can advise the client what to do. So say you know I'm out here
[23:02.160 --> 23:08.520]  in California now the soils here are very compacted, heavily clayed and so you
[23:08.520 --> 23:13.520]  basically pour water in an infiltration test and it won't go anywhere. So in that
[23:13.520 --> 23:19.360]  case I would say you know we have two choices. We can plow the field and add in
[23:19.400 --> 23:25.760]  compost and organic matter and hemic acid to really start to create a tilt
[23:25.760 --> 23:31.920]  that will support you know healthy grow or the other option is to just go on top
[23:31.920 --> 23:35.960]  of it. I mean it's if you're doing a small scale it's not a big deal to go on
[23:35.960 --> 23:40.000]  top if you're doing large scale it's a nightmare. It's really not feasible to do
[23:40.000 --> 23:46.440]  it that way. So again it just it really depends on the size of the project and
[23:46.440 --> 23:50.840]  also the budget because you know in some cases you know there's great
[23:50.840 --> 23:54.520]  expectations of I'm gonna make a ton of money but I don't have enough money to
[23:54.520 --> 23:58.600]  put into it and in that case I would be using cover crops but you're gonna lose
[23:58.600 --> 24:04.200]  a year because we have to get the soil ready and prepared to grow this cash
[24:04.200 --> 24:11.280]  crop. So did I answer your question Ethan? Yeah that was that was really helpful I
[24:11.280 --> 24:17.800]  guess on the you know six plants in my backyard in Western Mass I mean I think
[24:17.800 --> 24:21.320]  right now it seems like it's hard to get the kind of testing that you've
[24:21.320 --> 24:27.280]  discussed but I think that you've really at least painted a picture of what to
[24:27.280 --> 24:34.040]  start thinking about when approaching these projects. Cool and you know just to
[24:34.040 --> 24:39.040]  be honest with you you have UMass extension there that will do all these
[24:39.040 --> 24:44.760]  testing for you. Also Logan Labs they're another great one. The key to testing is
[24:44.760 --> 24:49.760]  that once you've picked a lab do not change that because each lab has
[24:49.760 --> 24:58.360]  different testing methods from Morgan to modified Morgan to Bray to Malik
[24:58.360 --> 25:02.880]  three and each one of these is going to give you different results. So if you
[25:02.880 --> 25:07.280]  switch between labs you're getting a drastically different picture and you're
[25:07.640 --> 25:13.040]  it's gonna get make it very confusing. So in in my experience if you pick a lab
[25:13.040 --> 25:18.320]  always stick with that lab and that labs method so you can compare the data going
[25:18.320 --> 25:23.840]  into the grow and then after the grow. I mean I tell people a lot look the canvas
[25:23.840 --> 25:29.360]  plant is a nutrient pig and it will pull a tremendous amount of these nutrients
[25:29.360 --> 25:34.640]  out of your soil. So it's ideal to go in knowing what's in your soil first so
[25:34.640 --> 25:39.800]  that you can amend for any deficiencies but after the run you should test again
[25:39.800 --> 25:46.480]  and build that back to where zero is. And right now we do not have a tremendous
[25:46.480 --> 25:52.280]  amount of data on what the cannabis actual nutrient level looks like. A good
[25:52.280 --> 25:56.760]  friend of mine Chip Osborne from Osborne Organics and I have been working for a
[25:56.760 --> 26:00.920]  couple years now trying to assemble that and but we've kind of ran into a brick
[26:01.040 --> 26:06.280]  wall and that is that every cultivar will pull different nutrients. So it's
[26:06.280 --> 26:12.400]  impossible for us to say where you're going to be. New data will begin to come
[26:12.400 --> 26:17.400]  out from different growers who are really focused on this but for us to try
[26:17.400 --> 26:23.120]  to guess where that is the closest we can say is is use the base standard test
[26:23.120 --> 26:26.760]  for corn or tomatoes believe it not which used to be the code word for
[26:26.760 --> 26:32.040]  cannabis which is ironic but tomato plants are heavy feeders. So if you look
[26:32.040 --> 26:37.200]  at the nutrition of a tomato plant and you see that you're deficient in some
[26:37.200 --> 26:41.400]  some of the nutrients based on what they want then amend those nutrients but
[26:41.400 --> 26:46.280]  always test again after. And then as far as the six plants I mean you what I
[26:46.280 --> 26:50.360]  would suggest you do is build a raised you know do an infiltration test and
[26:50.360 --> 26:54.800]  then when you if you get good infiltration dig down you know a couple
[26:54.800 --> 26:59.640]  feet and do it again. Now that's called a perk test. So now you're determining
[26:59.640 --> 27:04.040]  what kind of infiltration happens down at the lower level. The worst thing you
[27:04.040 --> 27:08.680]  want to do is dig a hole, fill it with organic matter and then have that turn
[27:08.680 --> 27:13.760]  into anaerobic cauldron which I've seen a lot of people do. So it's important to
[27:13.760 --> 27:18.320]  test the infiltration at the bottom of the hole as well as at the surface and
[27:18.320 --> 27:22.120]  if you get great infiltration at both the top and the bottom plant in the
[27:22.120 --> 27:26.800]  ground. If you get great infiltration at the top but not at the bottom then go up.
[27:26.800 --> 27:30.100]  You figure that you probably if you're gonna go with seed you're gonna want at
[27:30.100 --> 27:34.040]  least two feet of material. If you're going with clones you can cut that down
[27:34.040 --> 27:38.440]  to probably 18 inches. Some say 12. I think that's I think that's not in your
[27:38.440 --> 27:44.080]  advantage. I think you'd go minimum 18 and if you're gonna grow a monster tree
[27:44.080 --> 27:49.160]  you probably want three feet of soil. And again you can make a mound. You don't
[27:49.160 --> 27:54.440]  have to have you know a raised bed although I'm a big proponent of taking
[27:54.440 --> 28:02.040]  stones or recycling concrete or cinder block or bricks. Those will last you
[28:02.040 --> 28:06.320]  forever and if you do build the horizontal soil system you will never
[28:06.320 --> 28:10.320]  have to deal with it ever again. You won't throw anything away. The soil will
[28:10.320 --> 28:15.160]  mitigate moisture for you. It'll function fantastic and all you need to do is test
[28:15.320 --> 28:19.360]  it and add the amendments and add a little bit more you know your soils
[28:19.360 --> 28:24.200]  medium or super soil at the end of every season or at the end of every run. So a
[28:24.200 --> 28:29.320]  great question my friend. Hey I just wanted to reset the room for you Leighton
[28:29.320 --> 28:36.160]  and thank you Ethan. That was Ethan that asked that question right? Yes sir.
[28:36.160 --> 28:40.360]  Yeah thank you. So this is Sexy Soil Living Soils Conversation for Growers
[28:40.360 --> 28:45.280]  and Leighton as you know is a soil engineer biologist. Has Peter already
[28:45.280 --> 28:49.240]  introduced himself Leighton because I just stepped out for a second. No I don't
[28:49.240 --> 28:57.560]  think he did. Peter are you with us? If he's not I'll introduce him. So Leighton
[28:57.560 --> 29:04.480]  while you were monologuing I ran upstairs took a shower I shaved and I
[29:04.480 --> 29:10.280]  ran back downstairs and there are about 200 people watching on YouTube right now.
[29:10.480 --> 29:17.960]  Well you know me well I do monologue. I figured I'd have at least 12 minutes.
[29:17.960 --> 29:24.040]  Well introduce yourself Peter let the people know who you are. I was hoping to be
[29:24.040 --> 29:31.520]  the quiet guy here. I'm Peter Future Cannabis Project. Yeah what do I do? I
[29:31.520 --> 29:39.520]  don't know a lot of media stuff a lot of live broadcasts. The seed bank. He puts up
[29:39.520 --> 29:43.920]  a tremendous amount of valuable content for the cannabis community. That's what
[29:43.920 --> 29:49.400]  he does. And I see I'd like to I'd love it if you guys brought some of the
[29:49.400 --> 29:57.560]  people lingering in the audience up to the stage like I see Mojave Richmond
[29:57.560 --> 30:04.680]  and just turn it into a roundtable conversation. Sure Peter do you do you
[30:04.680 --> 30:08.160]  know how to move people around? There's Mojave look at that Edward you're a
[30:08.160 --> 30:19.000]  ninja. That was magical. Tell me who else to bring up. I'll bring them up. I'm just you guys I'm just loving the
[30:19.000 --> 30:21.760]  conversation I'm just listening to Leighton here I don't have much to add
[30:21.760 --> 30:28.600]  right now but I'm happy to join and be a part of what's going on here. I enjoy the
[30:28.600 --> 30:33.600]  platform a lot and good to see you here Peter. Good to hear your voice as well.
[30:33.640 --> 30:40.000]  You too. I'm yeah I've been multitasking I'm like I got to cook the sausage and
[30:40.000 --> 30:45.320]  veggies for dinner right now so I got to run back upstairs and then come into my
[30:45.320 --> 30:50.240]  dungeon which is the garage to make sure that the audio hasn't crapped out. So
[30:50.240 --> 30:55.120]  that's why that's why I was kind of hoping I'd let you guys freestyle and I
[30:55.120 --> 31:01.560]  could make sure my kids don't start tonight. All right you do that Peter
[31:01.560 --> 31:06.200]  we'll keep this thing running for you. Why don't we ask Adam he popped up here
[31:06.200 --> 31:11.960]  with a question. Can we help answer anything for you Adam? Sure this is Adam
[31:11.960 --> 31:16.520]  thanks for the room great discussion always appreciate hearing what you have
[31:16.520 --> 31:21.560]  to say Leighton and love you know the meandering stream that is the way that
[31:21.560 --> 31:27.880]  you teach us all the things that you know so appreciate that. And so yeah I
[31:27.880 --> 31:34.360]  had a question about the selectivity of mycorrhizal fungi. You know I do a
[31:34.360 --> 31:40.000]  cover crop in the winter to you know try to keep life going on and everything but
[31:40.000 --> 31:45.360]  also lately you know like I've been growing for 20 years you know hobby and
[31:45.360 --> 31:49.280]  some more commercial at times and everything but I was always really
[31:49.280 --> 31:54.000]  spoiled with clones and so I've had so much fun the last few years experimenting
[31:54.000 --> 31:58.280]  with making seeds. So part of that experimentation means I have tons of
[31:58.280 --> 32:03.400]  extra seeds that are totally untested and and not real clever selective
[32:03.400 --> 32:07.720]  breeding and everything. So I have them around and I was thinking hey why don't
[32:07.720 --> 32:14.800]  I add some cannabis seed to my winter cover crop mix just to in case the
[32:14.800 --> 32:19.520]  mycorrhizal fungi is selective enough that it really wants to hang out with
[32:19.520 --> 32:25.080]  cannabis roots specifically and I was wondering you know to some extent you
[32:25.080 --> 32:28.040]  get kind of weak plants through the winter so I don't really want to be
[32:28.040 --> 32:33.400]  inviting you know pest pressure into my garden but I was wondering if you know
[32:33.400 --> 32:37.800]  that shooting from the hip is that a silly idea or is it clever or somewhere
[32:37.800 --> 32:41.880]  in between? Thank you. This is Adam. I'm done.
[32:41.880 --> 32:46.720]  Thanks Adam. That was a great question. First of all you got to understand
[32:46.720 --> 32:51.200]  mycorrhizal products are hidden. You can't tell if you're getting anything or not
[32:51.200 --> 32:59.200]  and early on I was using a well-known national brand and wasn't seeing the
[32:59.200 --> 33:07.200]  results I expected so I sent a sample off to my friend Efren at MycoRoots to
[33:07.200 --> 33:12.560]  get a valuation to get a spore count and he basically came back to me and said
[33:12.560 --> 33:17.000]  this stuff's junk. The spores are all dried up. They look like raisins instead
[33:17.000 --> 33:22.280]  of grapes and the counts are ridiculously low so this is a non-viable
[33:22.280 --> 33:26.840]  product so I'm like oh I paid 50 bucks for a bag of clay and yeah he basically
[33:26.840 --> 33:31.520]  said yes and I said well how is it this industry is allowed to sell products
[33:31.520 --> 33:35.440]  like this and he goes well it's called they do all their work they get their
[33:35.440 --> 33:40.760]  accreditation a lot of them do send them to him because he is well respected in
[33:40.840 --> 33:46.360]  the industry and if you're gonna launch a product in Oregon you are
[33:46.360 --> 33:53.680]  required to send it to him for qualification. That being said if
[33:53.680 --> 33:59.080]  you're gonna spend the money on this product I recommend that you
[33:59.080 --> 34:04.800]  reach out to me and I can advise you as to which products are viable which ones
[34:04.800 --> 34:10.280]  are not without getting in trouble and he cannot so I can definitely steer you
[34:10.280 --> 34:13.160]  in the right direction to make sure that you're getting a product that is
[34:13.160 --> 34:18.120]  actually viable. Now to get back to your original question I love the idea I
[34:18.120 --> 34:24.800]  personally think that any cover crop is a great cover crop. Whether
[34:24.800 --> 34:31.640]  it's required for the mycorrhizae to overwinter the answer is no and there
[34:31.640 --> 34:36.920]  are many opportunist versions of mycorrhizae but again this is
[34:36.920 --> 34:40.480]  really cutting-edge because no one spent a tremendous amount of money
[34:40.480 --> 34:48.240]  studying long-term colonization are they viable which plants are they associated
[34:48.240 --> 34:52.280]  to which ones they're not it's just would cost a fortune to actually track
[34:52.280 --> 34:56.800]  all this information and the other thing too is you have to understand is that
[34:56.800 --> 35:03.280]  back to the products themselves if you're purchasing an in vitro grown
[35:03.280 --> 35:09.120]  mycorrhizae product there is no proof that that is actually getting an
[35:09.120 --> 35:14.360]  association that's grown in a lab so think about it as you throw this this
[35:14.360 --> 35:18.880]  spore in this perfect environment the perfect food perfect temperature perfect
[35:18.880 --> 35:24.600]  medium and then you take it out of there and you throw it into a credibly hostile
[35:24.600 --> 35:30.200]  soil system that is just if you're not moving your food and to think that that's
[35:30.240 --> 35:35.560]  going to somehow survive it's kind of like taking the rich fat kid tossing him
[35:35.560 --> 35:38.720]  into the ghetto and expecting him to figure out how to fend for himself when
[35:38.720 --> 35:41.760]  he's been everything's been handed to him in a silver spoon since he was born
[35:41.760 --> 35:46.080]  it's gonna no way he's gonna make it there now the opposite is true as well
[35:46.080 --> 35:50.400]  if you take that street kid who's had to fight for every single thing in the
[35:50.400 --> 35:55.640]  world and you throw him into a perfect environment he's gonna do really well so
[35:55.640 --> 36:00.440]  that's why it's important that any mycorrhizae product you buy is what's
[36:00.440 --> 36:08.120]  called in vivo so grown in nature that those products will survive and there is
[36:08.120 --> 36:12.560]  proof that those actually do colonize because what I always tell people to do
[36:12.560 --> 36:18.480]  too is once you use this product you're gonna want to wait 90 days 120 days and
[36:18.480 --> 36:24.120]  send root fragments to efferent to see what level of colonization you have if
[36:24.480 --> 36:29.680]  you're only 20% colonized you need to add some more if you get to 40 50 60
[36:29.680 --> 36:33.480]  percent colonized you don't need to do anything and that's kind of where we've
[36:33.480 --> 36:37.920]  figured out that that's the maximum effectiveness you're gonna get or
[36:37.920 --> 36:42.640]  efficacy you're gonna get with a mycorrhizal fungi is is that 40 to 60
[36:42.640 --> 36:48.400]  percent colonization so that being said again ranting about the products and the
[36:48.400 --> 36:52.560]  importance of understanding it you should also notice if they claim that
[36:52.560 --> 36:57.040]  they have trichoderma in the product that's a huge mistake all right
[36:57.040 --> 37:03.120]  trichoderma outcompete mycorrhizae for infection sites so now you're putting in
[37:03.120 --> 37:07.960]  a short-lived trichoderma product that's going to not allow that association to
[37:07.960 --> 37:14.000]  happen so you just wasted your money again and so and also understand
[37:14.000 --> 37:19.160]  trichoderma is a contaminant it's in the air it's everywhere so you know I just
[37:19.160 --> 37:22.240]  don't understand the industry as a whole when they when they sell products
[37:22.240 --> 37:25.840]  and they actually list trichoderma on them it's basically you just shot
[37:25.840 --> 37:29.920]  yourself in the foot so you want a pure culture you want it definitely to be
[37:29.920 --> 37:35.400]  grown in vivo so in nature now you're off to the races now back to the
[37:35.400 --> 37:38.760]  question at hand understand that mycorrhizae associates with all
[37:38.760 --> 37:44.320]  different types of plants and that interaction is also moving nutrients and
[37:44.320 --> 37:48.000]  biology believe it or not there's a there's a highway on the outside of the
[37:48.000 --> 37:52.560]  fungi that allow bacteria to move around between plants as well so it's
[37:52.560 --> 37:56.600]  just an incredible system it's like it's like the difference between a phone call
[37:56.600 --> 38:03.040]  and high-speed internet it's it's night and day for anybody out there that's old
[38:03.040 --> 38:07.260]  like me you know I grew up with dial-up phones like you had literally hit the
[38:07.260 --> 38:13.400]  rotary and now I have a phone that I could land a Mars Rover with so you know
[38:13.400 --> 38:20.360]  it's mycorrhizae will provide you with that amazing level of nutrient
[38:20.360 --> 38:24.520]  functioning it's that's going to happen in your soil inner plants as well as
[38:24.520 --> 38:30.200]  material will be be able to be mined and traded nutrients all across the plants
[38:30.200 --> 38:34.680]  that you have so is the cannabis or hemp plant critical no but I love it because
[38:34.680 --> 38:38.200]  what's going to happen is in the spring you're going to chop and drop all that
[38:38.200 --> 38:43.320]  nutrient right back down into your soil and that cannabis plant took exactly
[38:43.320 --> 38:48.640]  what it wanted out of the soil so it did all the heavy lifting all the mining of
[38:48.640 --> 38:54.320]  those materials an incredible amount of exudates and what's called a P a PT
[38:54.320 --> 38:59.400]  which is the energy currency of the plant so it the plant basically takes in
[38:59.400 --> 39:03.920]  photosynthesis converts it to its energy currency now it can do different things
[39:03.920 --> 39:08.120]  different cell functions different communication move more exudates down to
[39:08.120 --> 39:11.760]  the root systems to grow out certain types of biology to mine more nutrients
[39:11.760 --> 39:16.840]  etc so that first plant did a tremendous amount of hard work to get those
[39:16.840 --> 39:21.680]  nutrients and now that plant falls over its dead it's right on the surface guess
[39:21.680 --> 39:27.760]  what that's free nutrients exactly what the cannabis plant wants so talk about
[39:27.760 --> 39:32.520]  cutting your energy currency down now the next season's plants in the spring
[39:32.520 --> 39:36.720]  have got all of this free nutrient that's that's easy to digest because
[39:36.720 --> 39:42.440]  it's just plant material it's not sand and clay and silt so you know it's it's
[39:42.440 --> 39:47.520]  free it's free nutrients out of the gate and now that plant can focus on growing
[39:47.520 --> 39:53.560]  stacking up expanding it's you know its profile of cannabinoids cannabinoids and
[39:53.560 --> 39:56.560]  terpenes because it's not wasting all its energy trying to mine those
[39:56.560 --> 40:01.120]  materials so I think I think that was a great question and if you're just if
[40:01.120 --> 40:05.040]  they're just junk seed why not it can't hurt and I think that you're the
[40:05.040 --> 40:08.880]  benefits that you're gonna get out of that in spring are gonna be incredibly
[40:08.880 --> 40:14.000]  valuable so I hope I answered your question there very much so thank you so
[40:14.000 --> 40:19.720]  much hey we're gonna move along here to the next person Mojave I know we brought
[40:19.720 --> 40:23.920]  you up already and friends of late but did you have a specific question or a
[40:23.920 --> 40:31.040]  comment you wanted to make I did not Edward actually I mean other than I'm
[40:31.040 --> 40:39.040]  just enjoying all the information I'm a consultant nowadays mostly but I
[40:39.040 --> 40:44.280]  definitely cultivated quite a bit in the early years and started out trying to do
[40:44.280 --> 40:50.600]  living soil blends back in the early 90s that were you know based off of whatever
[40:50.600 --> 40:54.800]  information I could get and for the most part killed miserably so it's I'm just
[40:54.800 --> 41:01.520]  really stoked to see people helping everyone get to a more sustainable form
[41:01.520 --> 41:07.800]  of cultivation so thank you sure hey we got Johnny Johnny thanks for coming up
[41:07.800 --> 41:13.480]  and being part of this sexy soil conversation welcome to the stage thank
[41:13.480 --> 41:19.040]  you first I just want to say thanks to Peter and Layton I've been tuning into
[41:19.040 --> 41:23.200]  the the future candidates project like every week and it's been a wealth of
[41:23.200 --> 41:28.280]  information I know Layton's helped me a lot even just hopping on the phone with
[41:28.280 --> 41:32.280]  me helped me troubleshoot my microscope and and all that different stuff so
[41:32.280 --> 41:36.960]  thank you for for all of that but my I I was hoping I mean maybe in the future if
[41:36.960 --> 41:39.960]  you guys hit an episode or it may be even just answer a couple questions for
[41:39.960 --> 41:45.240]  me like I got a soil testing done through Logan Labs and I'm gonna be
[41:45.240 --> 41:48.560]  honest with you I have no idea how to read this shit I'm looking at this
[41:48.560 --> 41:52.240]  there's so many numbers so many different things to look at I'm and it
[41:52.240 --> 41:56.480]  just seems so complicated and overwhelming that I was wondering is
[41:56.480 --> 42:00.160]  there a simple way or a resource that I can might be able to look into to help
[42:00.160 --> 42:04.600]  me understand and how to read a saturated paste test so that way I can
[42:04.600 --> 42:12.090]  make my own adjustments for my small like homegrown garden yeah I can give
[42:12.090 --> 42:17.050]  you that answer right now my friend it's very easy so it's understood that the
[42:17.050 --> 42:28.530]  balance in your saturated paste test should be 75% calcium 17% magnesium and
[42:28.530 --> 42:37.370]  8% potassium if you're if those levels are at that point you are considered the
[42:37.370 --> 42:43.090]  sweet spot now the next step is to look at your trace minerals people don't
[42:43.090 --> 42:48.610]  respect trace minerals they are critical for plant function I did a pie
[42:48.610 --> 42:55.410]  or a learn living soils calm conference over the winter and chip and I chopped
[42:55.410 --> 43:00.330]  it up one day in a presentation dual presentation where we discussed about
[43:00.330 --> 43:06.090]  those critical functions that the micronutrients or trace minerals provide
[43:06.090 --> 43:10.690]  so whenever I start with a soil test the first thing I do is I go saturated paste
[43:10.690 --> 43:15.970]  look at that balance okay now I know I'm in shape or I'm not a shape and
[43:15.970 --> 43:19.450]  then I can recommend different adjustments at that point next is my
[43:19.450 --> 43:23.650]  trace minerals and again I would be comparing those to a tomato plant to
[43:23.650 --> 43:26.810]  determine if if they're at the right level and if they're not at the right
[43:26.810 --> 43:34.330]  level then I get into kelp products I get into TM TM 8 or TM 7 I forget from
[43:34.330 --> 43:43.410]  bio AG I think it's 7 yeah so it's it's it's basically a humic acid in a powder
[43:43.410 --> 43:49.890]  form with seven trace minerals so then I then I you know I get an idea of what
[43:49.890 --> 43:54.690]  I'm gonna need I'm I apply it I wait about two weeks and I send it off for
[43:54.690 --> 43:59.370]  another test because again if those trace minerals are not present your
[43:59.370 --> 44:03.890]  plant is never gonna get plant hit full plant potential and that's the goal
[44:04.210 --> 44:10.570]  I mean we all want to see her express everything she possibly can for us
[44:10.570 --> 44:14.930]  because that's what we're after we're after those secondary metabolites and so
[44:14.930 --> 44:18.770]  it's critical that you give that plant everything it needs so that it can
[44:18.770 --> 44:25.090]  achieve that for you got it so I'm looking I pulled up my my saturated
[44:25.090 --> 44:31.370]  paste test right now like that they send me an email and it's 25% calcium 24%
[44:31.370 --> 44:36.810]  magnesium and 28% potassium yeah you got you got a beer way out of balance my
[44:36.810 --> 44:43.410]  friend yeah yeah all right so so bottom line is calcium and magnesium are double
[44:43.410 --> 44:49.410]  positive potassium is single positive so potassium is easy to knock off by adding
[44:49.410 --> 44:54.810]  more calcium magnesium is a little bit more difficult but what I would do is I
[44:54.810 --> 45:03.570]  would pound it hard with a amino based calcium product and I mean hard you can
[45:03.570 --> 45:08.530]  never have too much calcium as far as I'm concerned because believe it or not
[45:08.530 --> 45:14.130]  the plant if the plant has a bank account just loaded with calcium two
[45:14.130 --> 45:18.490]  things happen number one when it stretches in flower it's got all of its
[45:18.490 --> 45:23.650]  energy right there in its stores and second of all it can leak it as an
[45:23.650 --> 45:28.250]  exudate so say it wants magnesium it can push some extra calcium down into
[45:28.250 --> 45:34.050]  the soil system that's that calcium will bump the magnesium off of the exchange
[45:34.050 --> 45:39.770]  site which is the cation exchange site and then the plant can uptake it so
[45:39.770 --> 45:45.850]  calcium is a wonderful currency that the plant can use as it sees fit so in your
[45:45.850 --> 45:49.890]  case I would pound the soil with calcium and I would pound the plant with a
[45:49.890 --> 45:54.610]  foliar again an amino acid digested calcium so it doesn't have to do a lot
[45:54.610 --> 45:58.930]  of work got it so it's something like a water soluble calcium that I make with
[45:58.930 --> 46:03.730]  eggshells would that be something I'd be able to use that would yeah WSC yeah WSC
[46:03.730 --> 46:08.490]  I'm actually did an experiment where Chris kind of got mad at me I had a
[46:08.490 --> 46:12.810]  calcium issue in my soil for you that don't know this is called natural
[46:12.810 --> 46:17.890]  farming or Korean natural farming and I highly suggest that you guys look into
[46:17.890 --> 46:23.610]  it all of these are very affordable easy homemade nutrient systems that you
[46:23.610 --> 46:28.330]  can either apply foliar or soil drench and so the great tools for correcting
[46:28.330 --> 46:32.770]  things like this so I ended up doing double the strength so that was 500 to
[46:32.770 --> 46:37.530]  1 and I applied it to soil waited two weeks and went back and had it tested
[46:37.530 --> 46:43.090]  sure shit I got almost all the way back into balance with one application so it's
[46:43.250 --> 46:50.610]  a very valuable tool Wow that's impressive I didn't do the work the
[46:50.610 --> 46:55.650]  product did well I appreciate you answering my question thank you my
[46:55.650 --> 47:00.050]  pleasure were there any other questions out there oh we got we got more we have
[47:00.050 --> 47:04.290]  Taylor coming up and before we get to you Taylor I want to just reset through
[47:04.290 --> 47:08.290]  and let everyone know what we're talking about sexy soil living soils
[47:08.290 --> 47:13.250]  conversation for growers with Leighton Morrison and many of you know him he's
[47:13.250 --> 47:19.770]  a soil biologist soil engineer and Peter is the which it what's what is it it's a
[47:19.770 --> 47:24.250]  future cannabis project he's going live on YouTube right now yep he's been
[47:24.250 --> 47:29.290]  putting an amazing amount of content out to the cannabis community on worldwide
[47:29.290 --> 47:34.210]  on many different levels so check him out and definitely follow him and this
[47:34.210 --> 47:40.090]  this clubhouse is being simulcast on YouTube so it's kind of fun and we'd
[47:40.090 --> 47:44.130]  ask that you follow everyone in the room I'm starting to follow everyone we're
[47:44.130 --> 47:49.810]  gonna do this every Thursday from 4 to 6 and it's a it's a great community as you
[47:49.810 --> 47:53.810]  know we appreciate you being here taking the time out of your day to listen and
[47:53.810 --> 47:58.130]  and so we're gonna bring Taylor up the stage Taylor thank you for coming up to
[47:58.130 --> 48:05.250]  speak and welcome to sexy soils hi thanks everybody I've got two questions
[48:05.250 --> 48:09.810]  for you late in one's quick and easy and you already addressed it and the other
[48:09.810 --> 48:14.810]  is kind of more conceptual and would love to hear how you delve into it the
[48:14.810 --> 48:19.010]  first I was gonna ask you if you know anybody who is quantifying their
[48:19.010 --> 48:23.810]  mycorrhizal colonization after inoculating because it's something I've
[48:23.810 --> 48:28.810]  always been speculative about in these modified growing mixes cannabis systems
[48:28.810 --> 48:33.650]  and using you know standing technique to quantify it and you already mentioned
[48:33.650 --> 48:39.570]  that so I was just wondering what that lab was okay that lab is called my co
[48:39.570 --> 48:47.650]  roots my co r o o ts it's good friend of mine Efren he's very affordable I think
[48:47.650 --> 48:52.330]  it's like 50 bucks for the test follow the protocol that's really important he
[48:52.330 --> 48:58.570]  needs X amount of centimeters I think or meters of roots so you want to you
[48:58.570 --> 49:03.610]  want to collect the roots so that means taking the soil taking the plant pulling
[49:03.610 --> 49:08.050]  off the roots sifting out the soil so you just get a baggie full of roots but
[49:08.050 --> 49:12.730]  it's also beneficial to send him some soil but in a separate bag don't mix
[49:12.730 --> 49:16.250]  them together because then he has to pull them all apart and send him that
[49:16.250 --> 49:20.890]  soil because he can then tell you if they're sporulating so a lot of times we
[49:20.890 --> 49:25.530]  see colonization but we don't see the full cycle so it doesn't actually start
[49:25.530 --> 49:31.330]  reproducing that's what we want to see we want to see reproduction so that that
[49:31.330 --> 49:36.690]  soil so that mycorrhizae is is is going through its full cycle and and of course
[49:36.690 --> 49:41.130]  that's just going to build more and more mycorrhizae networks because those spores
[49:41.130 --> 49:45.210]  when they get hit by a root will germinate and create a whole nother
[49:45.210 --> 49:49.570]  connection so the more connections we can get the more nutrients that can be
[49:49.570 --> 49:56.050]  recycled the less work you got to do so again you know wait 120 days you know 90
[49:56.050 --> 50:00.810]  minimum 120 is better then pull your root samples if you've harvested your
[50:00.810 --> 50:05.890]  crop at 90 then pull the pull the samples but if it's if your plants
[50:05.890 --> 50:08.690]  growing a little bit longer wait a little bit longer because that's when
[50:08.690 --> 50:13.010]  you're really gonna see the level of colonization and it's again this is
[50:13.010 --> 50:16.850]  something that I don't see a lot of cannabis people do in our past
[50:16.970 --> 50:22.170]  conferences we've actually like auctioned off free tests root tests from
[50:22.170 --> 50:27.330]  Efron and given them away and not one person has followed through and actually
[50:27.330 --> 50:32.250]  had those tests done which in my mind is insane so hopefully that answers that
[50:32.250 --> 50:36.290]  and then what was the next one yeah you can sign me up to for the the sample
[50:36.290 --> 50:39.370]  there it's something that's always boggled me that nobody's quantifying
[50:39.370 --> 50:44.370]  that and they're spending quite an arm and a leg on the inoculum right so thank
[50:44.370 --> 50:48.050]  you late the other one is more conceptual I guess so I did some
[50:48.050 --> 50:52.570]  research on adding organic amendments to soil and looking at changes in soil
[50:52.570 --> 50:58.570]  porosity and matrix potential and it brings me to back to the modified
[50:58.570 --> 51:02.810]  growing mixes that cannabis growers are using and how a lot of folks are just
[51:02.810 --> 51:07.410]  constantly adding something like vermicompost or compost or you know
[51:07.410 --> 51:11.370]  incorporating organic matter really building a lot of organic matter and
[51:11.370 --> 51:14.650]  then you got folks who are using like the blue mat system and basing that
[51:14.650 --> 51:19.650]  their watering practices on matric potential on em bar but not really
[51:19.650 --> 51:23.650]  looking at a soil release curve to see through time as you're building up that
[51:23.650 --> 51:28.770]  organic matter are you changing the sort of porosity and do you need to adjust
[51:28.770 --> 51:34.650]  your watering practices based on how that porosity is affecting the matrix
[51:34.650 --> 51:39.490]  potential and so I guess it's really not a question as much as a curiosity that I
[51:39.570 --> 51:44.410]  have and just something I'd love to hear you talk about and see if you have any
[51:44.410 --> 51:49.810]  experience with if you've seen people in these systems dramatically change their
[51:49.810 --> 51:54.730]  soil porosity with with time with you know the continued addition of organic
[51:54.730 --> 51:58.050]  matter and if that's changed you know what they have to do with the watering
[51:58.050 --> 52:04.930]  practices great question Taylor great question so what he's talking about is
[52:04.930 --> 52:11.250]  basically super soils or soilless medium so a soilless medium would be the
[52:11.250 --> 52:16.610]  foundation of a super soil and basically it's one-third compost one-third please
[52:16.610 --> 52:22.530]  do not use peat moss use pit moss or use coca core again agro cocoa here on the
[52:22.530 --> 52:27.330]  west coast it's sold across the country that's a very sustainable and the beauty
[52:27.330 --> 52:33.730]  of using coir is that it's potassium rich so it's stored it's not gonna screw
[52:33.730 --> 52:37.570]  up your saturated paste test but it's available when the plant wants it it can
[52:37.570 --> 52:42.730]  mine it and the last part is aeration so one-third aeration which would be rice
[52:42.730 --> 52:48.970]  holes pumice wood chips anything like that to give the soil the ability to do
[52:48.970 --> 52:54.170]  its gas exchange very quickly so again that's allowing co2 to escape and oxygen
[52:54.170 --> 53:00.410]  to get down into the soil profile to help sustain that high level of
[53:00.410 --> 53:07.170]  biology so what happens in a soilless medium over time as that organic matter
[53:07.170 --> 53:12.450]  breaks down it becomes silt or fines and those fines migrate down to the bottom
[53:12.450 --> 53:16.610]  of the pot and then they become an anaerobic layer and anaerobic labors we
[53:16.610 --> 53:22.530]  want to avoid in our pot now in nature they're really important they serve all
[53:22.530 --> 53:26.930]  kinds of functions but in our little controlled environment we do not want
[53:26.930 --> 53:31.570]  them because what happens is when the root hits that anaerobic layer it melts
[53:31.570 --> 53:37.170]  the tip of it so if especially if you're growing by seed the taproot is the main
[53:37.170 --> 53:42.010]  nutrient sucking system and if you've limited that you've limited your plants
[53:42.010 --> 53:48.170]  ability to grow as well as hit its full potential so other things that I've seen
[53:48.170 --> 53:52.850]  is in living soil systems as people use a lot of earthworms and I love earthworms
[53:52.850 --> 53:57.210]  but you have to be careful because if you put too many earthworms in the pot
[53:57.210 --> 54:01.170]  and I was just having a conversation today on Peters platform with
[54:01.170 --> 54:06.370]  collectivist Coot and another one of the growers that we have had on the show our
[54:06.370 --> 54:10.610]  breeders we've had on the show a couple of times about exactly this situation
[54:10.610 --> 54:14.810]  that the worms just start working that material working that material and they
[54:14.810 --> 54:23.250]  convert it into worm castings now worm castings has a completely different what
[54:23.250 --> 54:29.010]  do I want to call it hydrostatic it just holds so much more moisture than a
[54:29.010 --> 54:34.690]  soilless medium the soilless medium we also is called low tension soil because
[54:34.690 --> 54:39.330]  when you try to measure soil tension soil moisture tension which is an
[54:39.330 --> 54:44.130]  incredible critical measurement or tool that you can have in your toolbox in
[54:44.130 --> 54:49.450]  these soilless mediums it's it's very difficult to get an accurate measurement
[54:49.450 --> 54:53.730]  because what happens at a certain centibar or millibar that meter will
[54:53.730 --> 54:58.290]  stall because there's not enough surface area coming in contact with that soils
[54:58.290 --> 55:03.170]  medium again this is why I came up with a horizontal soil system so you have a
[55:03.170 --> 55:07.970]  layer that you can actually get your aromather down into that will
[55:07.970 --> 55:12.890]  accurately measure the entire soil profile I did a really cool study with a
[55:12.890 --> 55:16.370]  guy who's doing crop steering with water alone
[55:16.370 --> 55:20.090]  yeah if you if you check into white papers this is a real thing and it's
[55:20.090 --> 55:24.850]  been done in the labs for years they've had 50% increase in fruit as well as
[55:24.850 --> 55:30.050]  potency as well as fruiting sites by using water to crop steer it's called
[55:30.050 --> 55:36.210]  epigenetic crop steering so anyway he hit me up because he heard the podcast
[55:36.210 --> 55:40.930]  on shaping fire episode 54 about the horizontal soil system and he goes look
[55:40.930 --> 55:45.610]  late and I've used I've tried every single censoring device across the
[55:45.610 --> 55:50.210]  planet I've spent as much as $1,500 for a sensor and as cheap as a couple
[55:50.210 --> 55:55.810]  dollars now they all stall either at the top point or the bottom point and where
[55:55.810 --> 55:59.210]  at where it's critical to measure this and he goes do you think this the
[55:59.210 --> 56:02.490]  horizontal soil system will work and I go absolutely you just got to put the
[56:02.490 --> 56:06.370]  meter right in there because that is going to give you a true measurement of
[56:06.370 --> 56:10.530]  overall moisture in that pot and he goes well what do I do about these cannabis
[56:10.530 --> 56:15.410]  growers in the soilless medium I go that's easy just take take clay sand and
[56:15.410 --> 56:21.170]  silt make a slurry wrap your sensor and then wrap that sensor in a burlap sack
[56:21.170 --> 56:25.730]  it'll probably last you you know maybe a couple years before you're gonna have to
[56:25.730 --> 56:29.170]  pull it out and repack it again but if you don't wrap it what's gonna happen is
[56:29.170 --> 56:33.850]  every time you water you're gonna start to wash that mud off the sensor so he
[56:33.850 --> 56:39.290]  did the test and it worked flawlessly now he could go from zero to 180
[56:39.290 --> 56:45.610]  millibars and now that is getting a true reading of the soil system so back
[56:45.610 --> 56:49.490]  to the worms as the worms start to break that material down and create the
[56:49.490 --> 56:53.450]  castings they're gonna hold moisture a lot more than the low tension soil
[56:53.450 --> 56:58.010]  system so that's that's a big deal that's that's an issue especially if
[56:58.010 --> 57:03.410]  you're you know above ground and pots did that hopefully answer the question
[57:03.410 --> 57:09.730]  yeah absolutely I'm I guess it absolutely did I think that the last
[57:09.730 --> 57:15.090]  point I would ask is you know do you see this being a concern for these folks who
[57:15.090 --> 57:21.890]  are growing in you know beds or pots of you know commercially available or
[57:21.890 --> 57:26.610]  homemade living soil on scale because I see a lot of folks that are not really
[57:26.610 --> 57:30.770]  changing their watering practices but I can only imagine that their porosity
[57:30.770 --> 57:35.410]  there in bars their organic matters building they all introduced wigglers
[57:35.410 --> 57:42.770]  or night crawlers you know so yeah I think you really didn't I appreciate it
[57:42.770 --> 57:47.330]  yeah again you know this is why the horizontal soil system and I mean you
[57:47.330 --> 57:52.810]  can you can cheat and and just put in a sand filter at the bottom it's not going
[57:52.810 --> 57:57.410]  to regulate like having that a horizon the a horizon lure literally is the
[57:57.410 --> 58:01.490]  heart and lungs of that soil system but it's better than nothing I mean at least
[58:01.490 --> 58:05.930]  now your fines are not going to be sitting in water they're gonna be
[58:05.930 --> 58:10.010]  sitting on top of the sand whole reason behind that sand filter is it protects
[58:10.010 --> 58:15.490]  the fines from getting down into your aquifer or your your place where excess
[58:15.490 --> 58:20.490]  water goes and again watering is the biggest issue I've ever seen across all
[58:20.490 --> 58:25.570]  types of plant growth either over or under and you know that's where when
[58:25.570 --> 58:29.850]  Alejandro hit me up about you know trying to help him get through his crop
[58:29.850 --> 58:35.330]  steering I got really excited because what he's done is amazing you know I'll
[58:35.330 --> 58:39.250]  post them up some stuff about him on my Instagram if you're not following me
[58:39.250 --> 58:44.330]  it's kingdom aquaponics LLC you can see it in my profile I try to put out some
[58:44.330 --> 58:48.330]  some decent content for people and I hope to get some of his information up
[58:48.330 --> 58:53.290]  he's he's alpha test he's beta tested and this late spring early summer he's
[58:53.290 --> 58:58.450]  gonna start field testing I'm getting a unit another friend of ours Brandon Ross
[58:58.450 --> 59:01.650]  is getting a unit and they'll probably be three other people that'll be
[59:01.650 --> 59:06.290]  actually field testing this so that he can get ready to to really go into
[59:06.290 --> 59:11.930]  production and launch full-scale probably 2022 I think that's an
[59:11.930 --> 59:15.770]  understatement Layton about you giving out a little bit of information here and
[59:15.770 --> 59:20.410]  there this is fantastic in the short time that you know we've known each
[59:20.410 --> 59:26.930]  other I can see why you have people that just love you and and learn from
[59:26.930 --> 59:31.690]  you and you are so generous with it so as we continue through the sexy soil
[59:31.690 --> 59:36.490]  living soils conversation for growers we have a new member it looks like she
[59:36.490 --> 59:42.450]  still has a little party hat little party popper is it Evie ain't are you
[59:42.450 --> 59:55.130]  there thank you thank you thank you guys so much I was actually so excited
[59:55.130 --> 59:59.170]  for this is the conversation this is why I wanted to be on Clubhouse just for the
[59:59.170 --> 01:00:02.730]  record because the this is the conversation like this soil
[01:00:02.730 --> 01:00:06.650]  conversation this is part of why I want to bring our crew more in so I'm from
[01:00:06.650 --> 01:00:11.890]  Eben flow funds in Ashland Oregon we're a tier two recreational license we focus
[01:00:11.890 --> 01:00:18.130]  on like- you know biologically driven kind of growing practices and we also
[01:00:18.130 --> 01:00:24.210]  cascade have collected which is a large scale hemp nursery and- a lot of ladies
[01:00:24.210 --> 01:00:29.810]  on our team and- awesome seal. Soil kind of geeks I'm excited to get Amy on here
[01:00:29.810 --> 01:00:34.610]  because I think she's really gonna love this conversation- and Layton. I'm
[01:00:34.610 --> 01:00:38.290]  pretty much here because I'm just to hear you say at the genetic soil
[01:00:38.290 --> 01:00:43.810]  steering like that's the whole- that's the point. So I'm so excited to hear some
[01:00:43.810 --> 01:00:48.370]  of your language and- this is definitely like the sexiest terms. That I've heard
[01:00:48.370 --> 01:00:53.810]  on Clubhouse so far in this in this room right here- so I guess my question would
[01:00:53.810 --> 01:00:58.370]  be- kind of more of a solution oriented so I've seen some issues in the valley
[01:00:58.370 --> 01:01:01.730]  where we're at we're in the road valley and I've seen some issues with with
[01:01:01.730 --> 01:01:05.890]  some islands across the board. And I'm you know we don't have it terrible we
[01:01:05.970 --> 01:01:09.410]  have some spots that were suspicious and then we have some spots where we have
[01:01:09.410 --> 01:01:13.890]  confirmed and then I'm seeing it on some larger scale grows I thought on a few
[01:01:13.890 --> 01:01:19.330]  hundred acres of hemp- and- you know people are throwing out some kind of odd
[01:01:19.330 --> 01:01:23.810]  solutions and we've had some- suggestions that seem like they've worked
[01:01:23.810 --> 01:01:28.930]  with fungal compost and I'm just curious- you know what you would say is
[01:01:29.010 --> 01:01:36.610]  a potential solution- with the soil there. Just so I'm clear the question is
[01:01:36.610 --> 01:01:41.570]  it's due to a fungal or- like PM or fusarium? No no no no it's just some
[01:01:41.570 --> 01:01:47.970]  phylum in the soil so it's the it's the pest basically is in the soil and- we're
[01:01:47.970 --> 01:01:51.810]  not exactly if they seem to be kind of native to this area because it's a
[01:01:51.810 --> 01:01:55.490]  agricultural rich area people have been growing here for a long time all sorts
[01:01:55.570 --> 01:02:00.290]  of things. And it seems like they're just in the soil in patches basically.
[01:02:00.290 --> 01:02:08.130]  So you're talking about a pest like a insect? Yeah they're they're they're
[01:02:08.130 --> 01:02:12.690]  little tiny insects that kind of come up in the soil so I'm just curious if you
[01:02:12.690 --> 01:02:19.570]  are familiar with these or you know have any solutions- oh I got solutions girl.
[01:02:19.650 --> 01:02:29.650]  Seems like I'm in the right place I mean yeah. Yeah so they're a pest in the soil and they can you know affect yield and they affect the plants all the different things they're they're nasty little critters and they're hard to get rid of.
[01:02:29.650 --> 01:02:34.450]  So what is their what is their longevity how many cycles do they have in the soil
[01:02:34.450 --> 01:02:39.570]  before- do they fly off at some point? No they pretty much like they come they live
[01:02:39.570 --> 01:02:44.290]  my understanding is that they live kind of low in the soil and that they'll come
[01:02:44.290 --> 01:02:47.970]  up to the surface to feed on the roots of the plants and then they'll come back
[01:02:48.130 --> 01:02:52.210]  to the surface to feed on the roots of the plants and then you can kind of see you're like walking down a row
[01:02:52.210 --> 01:02:55.890]  and like what the hell is wrong with this like seven or eight plants?
[01:02:55.890 --> 01:03:00.610]  And then they're- the way you test for them is you leave like a piece of potato out
[01:03:01.250 --> 01:03:06.050]  on top of the soil and then you can pick it up and you can see these kind of they're almost like
[01:03:06.770 --> 01:03:10.050]  teeny tiny microscopic like centipede looking kind of guys.
[01:03:10.210 --> 01:03:18.290]  Okay I have heard of these guys yeah those guys are a real problem because they go so low in the soil
[01:03:18.290 --> 01:03:25.410]  they're basically sheltered from from pesticides. So what you've done is you've actually created a
[01:03:25.410 --> 01:03:32.450]  trap which I think is a great start. Another thing that I would highly recommend is a very
[01:03:33.010 --> 01:03:41.090]  biologically active compost and now when you when you plant are you seeding or are you putting in
[01:03:41.090 --> 01:03:44.130]  clones or how how are you getting your plants into the field?
[01:03:46.450 --> 01:03:53.010]  I mean we do both I mean we do more clonal propagation on the recreational side and then
[01:03:53.010 --> 01:03:59.810]  on the hemp side we'll kind of do either but we have we have done it seemed like the fungal
[01:03:59.890 --> 01:04:06.690]  we did a really fungal dominant compost per you know some recommendations and that seems like it
[01:04:06.690 --> 01:04:12.290]  helped and so I guess you know it seemed like it helped I'm not a hundred percent sure if it's
[01:04:12.290 --> 01:04:16.610]  going to take it away this year but we're going to kind of see what happens there but I'm seeing
[01:04:16.610 --> 01:04:24.290]  it for some farmers on a pretty substantial scale so I'm curious about you know it's like I guess
[01:04:24.370 --> 01:04:29.890]  is that a viable answer when people are doing like hundreds of acres I guess or you know like
[01:04:29.890 --> 01:04:37.970]  30 acres or something? All right so what I would recommend is you build a biological
[01:04:38.690 --> 01:04:43.970]  biologically active compost and I would recommend you do it with your hemp stock,
[01:04:44.930 --> 01:04:50.290]  your cannabis stock, any kind of biomass left over at the end of the harvest
[01:04:50.370 --> 01:04:56.050]  you create a huge pile you know we should we should actually hit me up on on Instagram and
[01:04:56.050 --> 01:05:00.770]  I'll really dive down this hole with you but to answer your question yes this is how we've
[01:05:00.770 --> 01:05:08.530]  done it on scale basically you take that compost and you liquefy it basically it's called a soft
[01:05:08.530 --> 01:05:15.730]  collider so imagine if I was we were in a pool and I punched you underwater I wouldn't hurt you I
[01:05:15.970 --> 01:05:21.490]  would just brush you you'd feel the pressure of my hand so it wouldn't hurt you now above ground
[01:05:21.490 --> 01:05:28.370]  obviously it hurts so what you're doing is you're colliding this material underwater with different
[01:05:28.370 --> 01:05:37.490]  forces to basically gently peel off the fungal the nematodes the bacteria the protozoa and then
[01:05:38.050 --> 01:05:49.010]  the protozoa and then you take that liquid about 15 gallons to 110 gallons you've got 125 gallons
[01:05:49.010 --> 01:05:58.450]  of material it'll cover 3.5 acres I'm actually probably going to be setting up a hub in Illinois
[01:05:58.450 --> 01:06:05.890]  for a lot of the farmers out there where we're going to be taking in 10 5-gallon compound buckets
[01:06:05.890 --> 01:06:12.370]  of their compost that they made running it in my soft collider and sending them off with a
[01:06:13.490 --> 01:06:20.930]  280 gallon tote of concentrate which they can then treat 300 acres at a whack and this will be very
[01:06:20.930 --> 01:06:25.490]  affordable for them as well so you know if you've got enough farmers up there that want to get
[01:06:25.490 --> 01:06:32.610]  together and create another hub I have to order the equipment that takes about you know six months
[01:06:32.610 --> 01:06:39.170]  to get this piece of equipment made it's not cheap the the complete suite of equipment would
[01:06:39.170 --> 01:06:46.930]  probably run about 80 to 100 thousand dollars but once that's done it's very low maintenance to
[01:06:46.930 --> 01:06:52.370]  actually operate it and it can be used you know pretty much year-round it's as long as it's
[01:06:52.370 --> 01:06:56.850]  indoors so you can use it you can make the product and sell it to indoor growers as well
[01:06:57.410 --> 01:07:03.730]  this is hands-on information I would invite everyone in the room right now to tap on Layton's
[01:07:03.730 --> 01:07:09.250]  profile hit his bell that will know and then hit always that will notify it every time he's
[01:07:09.250 --> 01:07:15.090]  speaking this is sexy soils living soils conversation for growers we're doing it every
[01:07:15.090 --> 01:07:22.290]  Thursday from four to six I'm Ed he's Layton and up to the stage Evian or you listen it's like
[01:07:22.450 --> 01:07:28.050]  listen it's like the water Evian did we answer that question properly for you you guys are
[01:07:28.050 --> 01:07:33.490]  brilliant and thank you Layton for the answer and I'm super excited to tune in I actually just put
[01:07:33.490 --> 01:07:38.930]  that on my calendar so I don't miss the future and I did I hit the bell because definitely this
[01:07:38.930 --> 01:07:43.810]  is the conversation we're here for so thank you so much appreciate it and thank you for hosting
[01:07:45.090 --> 01:07:51.410]  yeah my pleasure and you know you would you would not it's hard to believe that just liquefying
[01:07:51.410 --> 01:07:58.290]  compost the the benefits are insane I mean it soaks down into the soil it changes the diversity
[01:07:59.090 --> 01:08:05.090]  the plants get so much more healthy pests seem to to to move on somewhere else where there's easy
[01:08:05.090 --> 01:08:13.010]  pickings or they end up becoming food source for for the incredible diverse and and you know intense
[01:08:13.010 --> 01:08:19.090]  biological activity in the upper side of the upper part of the soil profile so they just become they
[01:08:19.090 --> 01:08:23.970]  just slowly go away so I definitely think that would help solve your problem not sure if you
[01:08:23.970 --> 01:08:30.450]  I can do much other than suggest you put out you know half potatoes all over the place especially
[01:08:30.450 --> 01:08:35.330]  in the areas where you're seeing that concentration and then just switch out those potatoes like cut
[01:08:35.330 --> 01:08:41.170]  them cut them again slice the the insects off put the other half back down again and repeat and and
[01:08:41.170 --> 01:08:46.530]  and harvest as many of them as you can that should be able to scale is a little bit too big for that
[01:08:47.490 --> 01:08:51.650]  that sounds like a living nightmare and yeah I'm a huge fan of compost I mean I've studied
[01:08:51.650 --> 01:08:56.370]  biodynamics for a long time and stuff too so we definitely I like to hear this application at
[01:08:56.370 --> 01:09:00.850]  scale because that's all that's my passion is like how we take some of these regenerative
[01:09:01.410 --> 01:09:06.130]  agriculture principles and we start to apply them to scale because when people are growing
[01:09:06.130 --> 01:09:11.170]  things at hundreds of acres and growing cannabis monocrop on hundreds of acres I think that that's
[01:09:11.170 --> 01:09:16.130]  where the information you're sharing is going you know it's how we can transform over the next few
[01:09:16.210 --> 01:09:20.450]  years because either we have a choice we can do it in a way that's going to you know be detrimental
[01:09:20.450 --> 01:09:24.690]  to the earth or beneficial and so I'm super excited to hear that you're doing this stuff on
[01:09:24.690 --> 01:09:31.090]  scale yeah absolutely and remember cover crops never let that soil go bare and I might suggest
[01:09:31.090 --> 01:09:38.290]  that you try to figure out what other cover crops that that particular pest does not like
[01:09:38.290 --> 01:09:42.370]  and grow it there in between your runs and even while your plants are growing
[01:09:42.850 --> 01:09:49.090]  brilliant yeah we're huge fans we do a lot of polyculture and and cover crops and I preach
[01:09:49.090 --> 01:09:55.490]  all the cover crops thing too so I'm 100% that's a great idea we'll look into what potentially could
[01:09:55.490 --> 01:09:59.730]  be a deterrent thank you absolutely it's all about biomimicry my friend
[01:10:00.770 --> 01:10:07.090]  hey Tom has been waiting patiently Tom welcome to the stage and welcome to Sexy Soils
[01:10:07.810 --> 01:10:13.410]  hello hi thank you for having me up I was just listening and it's very interesting
[01:10:14.530 --> 01:10:20.130]  I think I realized that my question may be a little bit more general so let me know if it's
[01:10:20.130 --> 01:10:29.810]  a little bit too general but I've been working on nitrogen fixation on the basic research site
[01:10:30.690 --> 01:10:38.370]  basic various microbes fixing nitrogen and so obviously I'm familiar with the biological aspects
[01:10:38.370 --> 01:10:45.970]  of the soil microbes which a lot of them fix nitrogen and there's always a concern about
[01:10:47.170 --> 01:10:54.370]  people adding too much ammonia for the harbor bosh process and therefore even though they get very
[01:10:54.850 --> 01:11:04.290]  rich and fast crop yields but ultimately the soil becomes specialized and therefore really can't
[01:11:05.250 --> 01:11:14.690]  maybe adapt to new crops and so forth and so I was just wondering whether growers in general
[01:11:14.690 --> 01:11:23.650]  try to balance between increasing yields but at the same time keeping the microbial biodiversity
[01:11:23.970 --> 01:11:31.170]  which is really important because even right now we are studying microbes plant roots interactions
[01:11:31.170 --> 01:11:37.890]  and it's honestly quite still quite confusing we haven't really teased apart everything yet
[01:11:37.890 --> 01:11:45.650]  so I'm just wondering what the growers in general think about that in a very large
[01:11:45.650 --> 01:11:51.330]  big picture approach thank you very much oh Tom it's a pleasure my friend
[01:11:51.570 --> 01:11:56.450]  yeah so I got a couple suggestions first of all where are you in the world
[01:11:58.050 --> 01:12:01.090]  I'm doing research in University of Washington Seattle
[01:12:02.690 --> 01:12:09.890]  perfect are there any recirculating aquaculture systems up in your area
[01:12:11.890 --> 01:12:18.850]  not that I know of I'm strictly a microbiologist and I actually wandered in this room because
[01:12:19.010 --> 01:12:26.450]  area that is close to my heart but I think there might be maybe more in Oregon but I'm not sure
[01:12:26.450 --> 01:12:36.450]  about the Washington state okay so my work is all focused around harvesting aquatic microorganisms
[01:12:36.450 --> 01:12:45.170]  now believe it or not they are more often terrestrial as well I'll try to be do this
[01:12:45.730 --> 01:12:50.770]  as quick as possible so before the great human expansion say a thousand two thousand years ago
[01:12:51.730 --> 01:12:58.050]  the whole earth was covered with mass migration so birds that would darken the sky geese humming
[01:12:58.050 --> 01:13:03.570]  birds you know all different types of birds that would all intermix with water and then fly away
[01:13:03.570 --> 01:13:08.770]  and we know that the birds that ate you know that the algae that had fish eggs would poop those fish
[01:13:08.770 --> 01:13:13.170]  eggs in another pond hundreds of miles away and they would still be viable and they would still
[01:13:13.170 --> 01:13:17.810]  hundreds of miles away and they would still be viable this is true with all the microorganisms as
[01:13:17.810 --> 01:13:24.690]  well and of course the deer that the buffalo the water buffalo the moose would all crash and thrash
[01:13:24.690 --> 01:13:29.970]  through streams lakes rivers and up onto the soil and the bacteria or the biology would film
[01:13:30.770 --> 01:13:35.330]  would create biofilm on their hair and it would clump and as that hair fell out that would be a
[01:13:35.330 --> 01:13:40.530]  little inoculant here they are everywhere hundreds of miles all over the planet so there's this
[01:13:40.530 --> 01:13:47.090]  really incredible interaction between aquatic microorganisms and terrestrial microorganisms
[01:13:47.090 --> 01:13:53.890]  another great example endophytic fungi they live in the leaf that leaf falls onto the ground that
[01:13:53.890 --> 01:14:00.210]  turns into a saprophytic fungi if it falls into the water it becomes an aquatic fungi they're
[01:14:00.210 --> 01:14:05.490]  still they're still cycling nutrients they're still doing all the things so we're being beginning to
[01:14:05.490 --> 01:14:10.450]  understand that fungi a lot is a lot like an insect and goes through multiple phases
[01:14:11.090 --> 01:14:16.610]  and eventually ends up back in as an endophyte again so you know the interaction between aquatic
[01:14:16.610 --> 01:14:23.810]  microorganisms and terrestrial is is is more than just yin and yang and so my earliest work was was
[01:14:23.810 --> 01:14:30.210]  figuring out how to capture this waste stream from aquaculture create a product with it and then use
[01:14:30.210 --> 01:14:38.850]  it to to seed otherwise destroyed dirt and get it going and what i've noticed is that specifically
[01:14:38.850 --> 01:14:44.770]  with the aquatic microorganisms they have an incredible plume of yeasts now those yeasts
[01:14:44.770 --> 01:14:51.010]  make way for the saprophytes to come in and take over so it's again everything is in succession
[01:14:51.010 --> 01:14:55.730]  so just like in soil it goes from the swamp to the redwood forests and so the same thing is
[01:14:55.730 --> 01:15:01.010]  happening on a microbiotic scale that these different communities are coming in to make ready
[01:15:01.010 --> 01:15:05.810]  for the next community which is making ready for the next community etc etc right up the ladder
[01:15:05.810 --> 01:15:12.450]  so in in your particular world you know i would look at the aquatic microorganisms as a as a great
[01:15:12.450 --> 01:15:19.010]  place to really start to wrap your head around how valuable they are so you have nitrogen fixers you
[01:15:19.010 --> 01:15:25.570]  have um you know all different types of nitrogen breakdown cycles from ammonia to nitrite to
[01:15:25.570 --> 01:15:32.610]  nitrate um and all of those are phosphate solubilizing bacteria potassium solubilizing
[01:15:32.610 --> 01:15:38.530]  bacteria that live in that water column that if you put them in soil they will colonize um you
[01:15:38.530 --> 01:15:44.530]  know i've been doing this for about 12 or 13 years now and the results that i get when i apply this
[01:15:44.530 --> 01:15:51.010]  to soil is insane um so you know incredibly value and then there's this other thing i don't know if
[01:15:51.010 --> 01:15:56.610]  you've ever heard of this corn uh down in in the in the southern part of mexico which is just
[01:15:57.170 --> 01:16:06.050]  mind-blowing you ever heard of an aerial root yes yes i've heard of aerial roots yep all right so
[01:16:06.050 --> 01:16:12.850]  this particular uh corn has aerial roots so they excuse my language but they look like a clump of
[01:16:12.850 --> 01:16:19.250]  penises coming off a stalk of the corn and they're coated in a clear gel and what really blows my
[01:16:19.250 --> 01:16:25.650]  mind is that inside that clear gel are nitrifying bacteria that are pulling nitrogen out of the
[01:16:25.650 --> 01:16:32.690]  atmosphere and feeding it to that corn plant now the interesting thing is that most nitrifying
[01:16:32.690 --> 01:16:39.410]  bacteria um don't do well in intense sunlight especially at high altitude with high uv
[01:16:40.130 --> 01:16:45.650]  and they're in a suspended in a clear slime i mean those guys the whole world should be
[01:16:45.650 --> 01:16:53.410]  trying to figure out how to in viva in vivoly grow those bacteria um because if you put those
[01:16:53.410 --> 01:16:58.530]  sprayed those on a regular plant um and even though it didn't have an aerial root um if you
[01:16:58.530 --> 01:17:04.930]  coated the stalk of the plant with those guys and they've created that biofilm imagine all the free
[01:17:04.930 --> 01:17:11.490]  nitrogen you want right out of the atmosphere i think that is a huge uh thing for potential in in
[01:17:11.490 --> 01:17:17.010]  the near future if if somebody was smart enough to actually start to really you know dive down
[01:17:17.010 --> 01:17:23.730]  that rabbit hole on a university level i mean that sounds like somebody could just graft uh cannabis
[01:17:25.570 --> 01:17:33.410]  stop grafting onto that you know some plants you can graft and others you can't like i know you can
[01:17:33.410 --> 01:17:38.930]  graft a canvas plant to a hops plant uh but you can't do the other way around so i there's
[01:17:38.930 --> 01:17:44.210]  definitely like some interactions that might or might not work but again if you could just call
[01:17:44.210 --> 01:17:50.050]  if you could just grow out the bacteria um i'm sure you could figure out a way to get it to take
[01:17:50.050 --> 01:17:55.810]  hold on a different type of plant but um yeah this it's the future is bright nowadays for sure
[01:17:55.810 --> 01:18:03.570]  with potential if we don't kill ourselves first thank you thank you yes um one strain of bacteria
[01:18:03.570 --> 01:18:12.610]  um the genus isotobacter um they are um aerobic nitrogen fixes so so that might be of interest to
[01:18:12.610 --> 01:18:23.250]  you and uh they they form um sort of gooey colonies and so um uh you could look that up and see whether
[01:18:23.250 --> 01:18:30.130]  they are of interest but i just looked up your uh profile and you're actually in connecticut uh and
[01:18:30.130 --> 01:18:36.530]  that's where i did my graduate studies in uh yukon oh nice small world my friend and right
[01:18:36.530 --> 01:18:41.410]  and right now i'm out here in the west coast in octonaut california so i chase you out to the
[01:18:41.410 --> 01:18:49.330]  west coast yeah well thank you very much you're welcome you're welcome hey i've got a question
[01:18:49.410 --> 01:18:56.210]  for you tom is up there in washington i live in washington in the seattle area for five years and
[01:18:56.210 --> 01:19:03.490]  there's a tremendous amount of um aquaculture you know fish farming in the puget sound going back to
[01:19:03.490 --> 01:19:09.490]  the 80s um is there any relationship that you know of that's been established between those those
[01:19:10.130 --> 01:19:15.810]  fish farms and any kind of uh any kind of fertilizers or any kind of things you're talking
[01:19:15.810 --> 01:19:24.290]  about unfortunately no the problem in uh fish pen farming or aquaculture is that all of the waste is
[01:19:24.290 --> 01:19:30.930]  just flowing throughout the bottom um and unfortunately it is actually detrimental because
[01:19:30.930 --> 01:19:36.210]  if you look again back before the great expansion like out on cape cod the bay i mean that was just
[01:19:36.210 --> 01:19:41.250]  you could walk across the bay there were so many fish you know striped bass blue blue fish etc
[01:19:41.730 --> 01:19:48.770]  um and unfortunately you know they would migrate in they would thrash and trash they would breed
[01:19:48.770 --> 01:19:54.850]  and then they would leave and so they would leave all of this amazing um you know amo aquatic
[01:19:54.850 --> 01:20:00.610]  microorganisms that where they've left and they allowed that to start to work into the and be
[01:20:00.610 --> 01:20:07.170]  taken up by the plants and and the other animals in in that system so you know it wasn't a constant
[01:20:07.170 --> 01:20:12.290]  stream of waste it was a they came in they did their business and they beat it whereas where
[01:20:12.290 --> 01:20:18.130]  we're doing fish pen farming that pen is is basically anchored to the ground so it's just
[01:20:18.130 --> 01:20:25.730]  constantly dumping nutrient um and organisms down into um the lower part of the puget so that's
[01:20:25.730 --> 01:20:31.410]  it's kind of a unfortunate thing and i you know i've seen you know especially in in like asia
[01:20:31.410 --> 01:20:37.010]  where they've they've destroyed entire bays because they've they've put too much aquaculture
[01:20:37.010 --> 01:20:45.170]  in concentration in these bays um so you know i'm a big fan of these deep ocean pens where where now
[01:20:45.170 --> 01:20:51.170]  they're floating out there um the big problem is of course you know hurricanes and storms out there
[01:20:51.170 --> 01:20:56.530]  can just shred the pen and of course you lost everything so there has to be a balance between
[01:20:57.090 --> 01:21:04.050]  the way we farm aquaculture in the oceans that we're not doing now and i'm a huge fan of what's
[01:21:04.050 --> 01:21:10.690]  called recirculating aquaculture systems on land in the future we're going to have serious issues
[01:21:10.690 --> 01:21:18.770]  with protein fish are by far the best have the best feed conversion ratio so if you feed a fish
[01:21:18.770 --> 01:21:24.610]  a pound and a half of food you're going to get a pound of of production out of that fish if you
[01:21:24.610 --> 01:21:31.890]  feed a cow 20 pounds of food you're going to get one pound of food conversion so fish are the future
[01:21:31.890 --> 01:21:39.330]  for inexpensive affordable protein for the masses but we can't we can't we can't continue to grow
[01:21:39.330 --> 01:21:49.740]  it the way we are in our oceans now uh we land-based now you can harvest that stuff you
[01:21:49.740 --> 01:21:56.220]  can harvest those those aquatic microorganisms and you can start fixing the fields in the great west
[01:21:56.220 --> 01:22:01.820]  you know in the in all over all over our country by taking those products and putting them in a in
[01:22:01.820 --> 01:22:06.540]  a you know a giant sprayer and running them across the fields especially if you've got cover crops
[01:22:06.540 --> 01:22:12.060]  you're gonna you're gonna have incredible turnaround of what i want to call dirt into soil
[01:22:12.060 --> 01:22:16.300]  so i hope i hope that answered it but the problem the other problem with recirculating
[01:22:16.300 --> 01:22:22.620]  saltwater fish systems is that you build up the sodium too high in the manure so then you have to
[01:22:22.620 --> 01:22:28.060]  process that manure to get rid of the salts now it's a whole other process it gets expensive but
[01:22:28.060 --> 01:22:35.260]  i think the the real future is it should be on freshwater aquaculture land-based restart
[01:22:35.260 --> 01:22:41.420]  recirculating not flow through um that we can harvest them at waste from and apply on large
[01:22:41.420 --> 01:22:47.020]  scale for agriculture you could you could actually do that with a clay pound i've actually seen uh
[01:22:47.020 --> 01:22:53.900]  recirculating aquaponics setups with coy and uh yeah you use basically any sort of perennials you
[01:22:53.900 --> 01:23:00.300]  can grow like like they grow like wildfire like i've seen numbers almost hitting like twice the
[01:23:00.940 --> 01:23:06.540]  normal growth rate in soil that you do from a recirculating aquaponics oh you're spot on my
[01:23:06.540 --> 01:23:15.420]  friend you're spot on and coy like um other fish are very like like tilapia so easy they're just
[01:23:15.420 --> 01:23:21.740]  hardy you don't have to worry about ph water quality and the beauty of coy is you grow them
[01:23:21.740 --> 01:23:26.460]  for a year and you can sell them at three times four times five times what you paid for them
[01:23:27.100 --> 01:23:32.700]  so now you have another income stream and you got to you know feed your plants um again that's why
[01:23:32.700 --> 01:23:39.020]  i do what i do with with aquaculture waste because the plant reaction is insane like if i spray my
[01:23:39.020 --> 01:23:45.980]  product on on a new cover crop it turns neon green within about 20 minutes to half an hour
[01:23:45.980 --> 01:23:53.900]  if i spray it on a on a shrub or a bush or a lawn i will see that turn deep deep purple red
[01:23:54.860 --> 01:23:59.900]  because what it's done is it's just opened itself up and now it just wants as much light as it
[01:23:59.900 --> 01:24:06.780]  possibly can so it's expressing the colors of light that it wants blue and red because it gets
[01:24:06.780 --> 01:24:13.500]  plenty of green so you know the power of microorganisms or aquatic microorganisms
[01:24:13.500 --> 01:24:20.220]  will surely be a bright future in the human in the future for humanity for sure oh yeah i was
[01:24:20.220 --> 01:24:25.580]  actually going to say as well for all the vegans out there who may object to eating animals that
[01:24:25.580 --> 01:24:31.100]  you know a pound of almonds also takes 56 gallons of water and all you get is a pound of usable
[01:24:31.100 --> 01:24:36.380]  plant material from mass production of almonds meanwhile if you give a typical indoor cannabis
[01:24:36.380 --> 01:24:43.900]  plant 14 weeks 60 gallons of water you end up with 10 pounds of hemp hemp fiber seed oils uh
[01:24:43.900 --> 01:24:49.180]  any stuff you can press i mean you you could use the entire plant so even in comparison for
[01:24:49.740 --> 01:24:57.340]  other plants like just the mass mass production of protein that we use do in america is just
[01:24:57.340 --> 01:25:02.060]  really bad when it comes to the wastewater and wasting nutrients and ruining the environment
[01:25:02.060 --> 01:25:08.540]  around it oh don't don't get me started on water cycles my friend i'll go on for a day on that one
[01:25:08.540 --> 01:25:13.260]  how's it going layton and everyone we're uh hey what's up a little bit late but we're here we're
[01:25:13.260 --> 01:25:18.540]  here so hopefully you guys have been uh chopping it up and making some new friends along the way
[01:25:19.820 --> 01:25:24.940]  yes we have my friend yes we have hey craig why don't you introduce yourself and then lay if you
[01:25:24.940 --> 01:25:29.580]  do the same thing since you guys just got here welcome yeah definitely uh for anyone that wasn't
[01:25:29.580 --> 01:25:34.780]  tuned in last week uh it was definitely a bit more master of ceremony so good to kind of take a back
[01:25:34.780 --> 01:25:40.300]  seat uh i was doing a round table recording for a podcast working on applied mycology i'll plug
[01:25:40.300 --> 01:25:45.660]  a little later on as well my name is craig truster i'm an applied mycologist uh educator and citizen
[01:25:45.660 --> 01:25:51.820]  scientist definitely kind of focusing on the inner intersection of um you know the roles that fungi
[01:25:51.820 --> 01:25:57.340]  plant soil definitely as architects of the soil and my journey starting with fungi led me into
[01:25:57.340 --> 01:26:03.020]  soil then into plants and larger ecologies and at a certain point you're like at what point does one
[01:26:03.020 --> 01:26:08.220]  organism or one consortium organisms or cells begin another one end so kind of the best way to
[01:26:08.220 --> 01:26:15.260]  move forward in this regenerative concept of growing or seeking reservoirs of organisms to
[01:26:15.260 --> 01:26:20.460]  boost our health because they're very much part of us just many cells that are us aren't us um you
[01:26:20.540 --> 01:26:26.620]  know 35 trillion human cells that are you are also accompanied by 35 trillion microorganisms
[01:26:26.620 --> 01:26:33.420]  between bacteria and fungi that are uh that are signaling and collaborating as well but um so
[01:26:33.420 --> 01:26:37.820]  that's kind of my nice little in medium-sized nutshell introduction leaf onto you buddy
[01:26:42.690 --> 01:26:49.090]  oh sorry i was finding the unmute button uh i'm leaf i guess i would call myself a
[01:26:49.090 --> 01:26:55.250]  interdisciplinary environmental scientist an educator i'm making some frozen some frozen fish
[01:26:55.250 --> 01:27:01.650]  ticks right now and uh well yeah craig that was that was a great little little diatribe there
[01:27:02.290 --> 01:27:08.450]  that was a good explanation i guess i'll frame where i'm at in a way jumping off of that in terms
[01:27:08.450 --> 01:27:15.330]  of every field of environmental science i've ever gotten involved in whether through casual or more
[01:27:15.330 --> 01:27:20.930]  professional research always led me to then realizing i needed to understand a different
[01:27:20.930 --> 01:27:24.530]  field of environmental science to actually understand the one i was currently studying and
[01:27:24.530 --> 01:27:29.250]  kind of back and forth and back and forth and you know and that all gets really relevant in this
[01:27:29.250 --> 01:27:35.570]  discussion of soil health and the ecology and the biogeochemistry and you know the ecological
[01:27:35.570 --> 01:27:39.810]  connections of all these things so i'm just uh you know trying to learn more soak it in you know
[01:27:39.810 --> 01:27:43.250]  share what i can sounds like y'all are talking about some great stuff here already
[01:27:46.290 --> 01:27:51.970]  yeah you guys missed some good chops up sessions for sure but um yeah psyched to have you guys back
[01:27:51.970 --> 01:27:59.570]  so uh we'll catch it on the replay there you go um craig do you want to uh step up and and
[01:27:59.570 --> 01:28:05.010]  be master of ceremonies and start taking questions again or uh i'm gonna take a little back seat i'm
[01:28:05.010 --> 01:28:10.050]  gonna let you kind of do things maybe we can trade roles but it can happily add uh add some insights
[01:28:10.130 --> 01:28:15.650]  questions as they arrive from people that hop up on stage beautiful um ed are you out there still
[01:28:15.650 --> 01:28:20.610]  you want to i i can't i haven't quite figured out how to master the question asking or answering
[01:28:21.250 --> 01:28:23.890]  section of this but uh ed you still there
[01:28:26.290 --> 01:28:31.890]  uh layton i did have a question actually for all of you my colleges the microbiologists um how do
[01:28:31.890 --> 01:28:36.930]  you guys feel about jeff lohenfeld's book series i mean that's pretty much what i got introduced to
[01:28:36.930 --> 01:28:43.330]  microbes and fungi and the you know soil food web interactions and really died that was my
[01:28:43.330 --> 01:28:50.930]  you know precursor to getting into really diving deep into it on my own so how do you guys feel
[01:28:50.930 --> 01:28:57.170]  about those book series i love them i think there was a yeah that was a great introduction he didn't
[01:28:57.170 --> 01:29:04.130]  he didn't like you know he didn't make you feel stupid he gave you the opportunity to learn
[01:29:04.850 --> 01:29:11.090]  a pretty complex concept um and then and then tied it all together in a way that i think is
[01:29:11.090 --> 01:29:15.810]  easy to read um yeah there's sections that you want to go back and reread a few times
[01:29:15.810 --> 01:29:23.570]  but a great introductory across the board go ahead yeah definitely um and so uh jeff lohenfeld's i
[01:29:23.570 --> 01:29:30.210]  believe he was a student of dr laningham um pretty i'm not sure when the exact year but a couple a
[01:29:30.210 --> 01:29:34.770]  few years back uh and definitely kind of went in to kind of uh introduce to you a bit of the
[01:29:34.770 --> 01:29:40.050]  history of farming a bit of the history of kind of the how we started depleting our microbial
[01:29:40.050 --> 01:29:45.490]  biomes through kind of different farming practices from kind of more of an industrial perspective or
[01:29:45.490 --> 01:29:50.370]  pre pre-industrial perspective as well about how we assume different nutrient pools and soil were
[01:29:50.370 --> 01:29:55.890]  there or not immediately available um i believe he also just followed up with two other books uh
[01:29:55.890 --> 01:29:59.570]  teaming with nutrients where he kind of goes into understanding all these different
[01:30:00.770 --> 01:30:04.770]  factors that are essential for plant and microbial nutrition and i think the third
[01:30:04.770 --> 01:30:10.130]  one is teaming with fungi which does offer a nice accessible kind of entry into the world
[01:30:10.130 --> 01:30:16.370]  of fungal interaction especially with soil fungi um since some of the literature can be pretty dense
[01:30:16.370 --> 01:30:22.690]  there's a fair bit of terminology um when it comes to discussing fungi and within mycology that's not
[01:30:22.690 --> 01:30:27.250]  as intuitive or you know maybe it's just not there a present number of science curriculums where they
[01:30:27.250 --> 01:30:33.650]  may be in you know grade school high school or even even in lower levels of uh college per se but
[01:30:33.650 --> 01:30:38.770]  yeah that jeff loanfields is a great introductory book um if you're someone that it's a great read
[01:30:38.770 --> 01:30:43.330]  it's easy to pick up he kind of keeps it uh keeps it going i think he makes a joke that in the book
[01:30:43.330 --> 01:30:47.170]  that he kind of like hopes to teach you along the way and kind of throw in some dad humor and dad
[01:30:47.170 --> 01:30:52.850]  jokes in so definitely kind of uh gets you engaged and also kind of builds that that um
[01:30:53.490 --> 01:30:59.570]  that enthusiasm that intrigue that will help you kind of allow you to deep dive deep dive
[01:31:00.770 --> 01:31:04.610]  dive deeper into topics where you may not have thought or may not have
[01:31:04.610 --> 01:31:07.810]  kind of or may initially kind of felt a bit overwhelmed so definitely recommend it
[01:31:10.370 --> 01:31:16.770]  yeah i mean it was my precursor i started off with teaming with microbes then fungi then nutrients and
[01:31:16.930 --> 01:31:22.530]  i would say that along with uh dr uh talker scott's book about how plants work those four
[01:31:22.530 --> 01:31:29.090]  books i feel like are just the foundational baseline for anyone trying to get into living
[01:31:29.090 --> 01:31:34.930]  soils or anyone trying to grow organically that's that to me that's what i give everybody
[01:31:34.930 --> 01:31:40.450]  that's why i tell people read these four books uh you might also want to try what a plant knows
[01:31:40.450 --> 01:31:46.770]  that's a really interesting insight to understanding plants communications with each
[01:31:46.770 --> 01:31:51.970]  other and the outer world i highly recommend that one wait i'm glad you brought that up i was going
[01:31:51.970 --> 01:31:57.970]  to ask and this is something i thought of one time sitting on the couch smoking some birthday funk i
[01:31:57.970 --> 01:32:01.730]  was thinking myself okay so we know plants communicate with each other through terpings
[01:32:01.730 --> 01:32:06.370]  like the smell of freshly cut grass is terpenes being released warning other plants that they're
[01:32:06.370 --> 01:32:12.130]  in danger they've been harmed so is there any way to i guess take stuff like spider mites like
[01:32:12.130 --> 01:32:18.050]  whatever pheromones they produce and and like basically make fake ones and spray that on the
[01:32:18.050 --> 01:32:24.370]  plant to simulate the pest pressure and production that you the resin production that you get that
[01:32:24.370 --> 01:32:30.210]  increases and lay flowers any way if you could like create that like make a fake version of fake
[01:32:30.210 --> 01:32:35.810]  analog of that to spray on plants or that's a dumb idea no no that's actually a great idea it's it's
[01:32:35.810 --> 01:32:42.610]  done across multiple disciplines uh here they have a big problem with ground squirrels and um so what
[01:32:42.610 --> 01:32:48.290]  they do is they actually shoot the ground squirrel they pelt them and they take the pelts and they
[01:32:48.290 --> 01:32:53.410]  burn it um and then they use those ashes to spread around and it works great in deterring them they
[01:32:53.410 --> 01:32:58.450]  don't want anything to do with it um a friend of mine who runs an insectary up here uh does
[01:32:58.530 --> 01:33:05.970]  something similar um it takes the takes the bugs um and and kills them um and then powderizes it
[01:33:05.970 --> 01:33:13.090]  makes it into a a foliar application that he can spray um on on plants that he's trying to protect
[01:33:13.090 --> 01:33:21.250]  from them now i would suggest this that a truly healthy cannabis plant grown in a healthy biological
[01:33:21.250 --> 01:33:27.010]  living soil system will not have those kinds of pest pressures because you have to think about
[01:33:27.010 --> 01:33:33.250]  what the pests function in nature actually is its job is to call that plant because that plant is
[01:33:33.250 --> 01:33:39.570]  not suitable for any other animal to consume it so they're only going to attack a weak plant and
[01:33:39.570 --> 01:33:46.210]  they're going to they're going to recycle it or re-reintroduce it into the soil system as as
[01:33:46.210 --> 01:33:52.290]  organic matter because it is again it's not suitable to be consumed by any other um organism
[01:33:52.290 --> 01:33:59.330]  or animal so the bugs really play an important part um in the whole ecosystem as far as keeping
[01:33:59.330 --> 01:34:05.250]  unhealthy things from from growing or breeding or spreading so just try to keep that in mind too
[01:34:07.490 --> 01:34:11.250]  thank you i didn't even know that because that was my idea why not just crush up a bunch of
[01:34:11.250 --> 01:34:14.690]  spider mites and spray it on the plant that way they get i get the rather production increased
[01:34:14.690 --> 01:34:20.290]  flower bulk without actually having to worry about spider mites i i'd like to jump in and
[01:34:20.290 --> 01:34:26.050]  say that there's actually there are companies that sell the insect pheromones and there's also
[01:34:27.010 --> 01:34:35.650]  some of the same terpenes in cannabis are like farnessine is the same terpene that aphids emit
[01:34:36.690 --> 01:34:41.570]  as their warning and there's a bunch of white papers that actually have been written about this
[01:34:41.570 --> 01:34:48.770]  um because they were doing research into whether you could you know mimic those pheromones and
[01:34:48.770 --> 01:34:53.730]  then spray them on the plant but you know the findings are kind of inconclusive and there hasn't
[01:34:53.730 --> 01:34:57.730]  really been any studies specifically with cannabis i think the majority of the studies were done with
[01:34:57.730 --> 01:35:02.130]  peas so um yeah i've actually have a collection of those white papers because i've read them
[01:35:02.130 --> 01:35:06.050]  because i'm kind of fascinated by the same idea because i see certain terpenes will raise
[01:35:06.770 --> 01:35:13.970]  or lower depending on um the specific pest that is kind of coming around that season so
[01:35:14.210 --> 01:35:19.410]  it's fascinating i would love to have that conversation more that's a great one thank you
[01:35:19.410 --> 01:35:25.010]  for sharing that um thank you for any of you that don't know there's a company called endo
[01:35:25.010 --> 01:35:31.330]  canna health and i highly recommend everybody that hears this actually have that test done and
[01:35:31.330 --> 01:35:36.530]  basically what they do is they do they take uh either your genetic test your family and friends
[01:35:36.530 --> 01:35:42.210]  genetic test or you can give them a sample and they'll run it through their system and they'll
[01:35:42.210 --> 01:35:48.290]  tell you which terpenes work the best for you which cannabinoids work the best which cannabinoids
[01:35:48.290 --> 01:35:53.730]  work the best the balance of them but the interesting thing is they've expanded out into
[01:35:54.370 --> 01:36:01.170]  terpene production so again it's an affordable way to buy super concentrated terpenes that you
[01:36:01.170 --> 01:36:07.730]  could use as a deterrent in in a multiple of different ways because you know like like she said
[01:36:07.730 --> 01:36:14.850]  everything has a sense or a hormone or pheromone that it gives off um and so why not again
[01:36:14.850 --> 01:36:23.290]  bio mimic nature man just bio mimic nature with every way you can all right are there any other
[01:36:23.290 --> 01:36:34.880]  questions out there all right maybe we should just go on a rant for 10 minutes uh leaf craig
[01:36:34.880 --> 01:36:40.400]  either one of you guys want to hop on and uh i have a quick question oh sure oh sorry the quick
[01:36:40.400 --> 01:36:47.680]  question is um what about um you know just kind of this idea of steering the um steering the plant
[01:36:47.680 --> 01:36:55.360]  with my like the what you were talking about the epigenetic uh steering of the plants and um just
[01:36:55.360 --> 01:37:01.280]  how they how the microbes or how essentially which different microbes could steer things in a
[01:37:01.280 --> 01:37:06.240]  different direction i've heard these different theories about especially with like hemp the you
[01:37:06.240 --> 01:37:12.960]  know total thc compliance and these other pieces that you would um there are certain microbes that
[01:37:12.960 --> 01:37:20.720]  could potentially keep um thca production or certain things down in a plant um is is that
[01:37:20.720 --> 01:37:26.960]  something that i mean i haven't seen any like actual studies um but i would be very interested
[01:37:26.960 --> 01:37:32.880]  to know just the epigenetic steering and microbes and and what your thoughts are there yeah there's
[01:37:32.880 --> 01:37:40.240]  a gentleman named brandon rust uh you can find him on ig under that name um he's doing some amazing
[01:37:40.240 --> 01:37:48.640]  work now he's he's going for thc so he has a consortium of uh i think it's like eight or
[01:37:48.640 --> 01:37:55.680]  eight or nine maybe 10 microorganisms that he introduced specifically to his soil system now
[01:37:56.400 --> 01:38:02.480]  he he's a super smart guy and he's taken in a direction i never anticipated see i'm all about
[01:38:03.120 --> 01:38:08.560]  biomimicry i'm about like the more the merrier i want to see as many different diverse organisms
[01:38:08.560 --> 01:38:14.480]  as i possibly can see and then let them figure it out are they do they want to be a part of this do
[01:38:14.480 --> 01:38:19.520]  they want to would they rather move on or or are they only there to build something for the next
[01:38:19.520 --> 01:38:25.120]  community to come and play whereas he's taken it to a point where he's he's tried to almost get
[01:38:25.120 --> 01:38:32.000]  so crazy that his soil's sterile and then he only introduced this it's basically an em like a not an
[01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:41.840]  em1 an em you know 10 um that he's had produced for him by a family friend who who is in uh
[01:38:41.840 --> 01:38:49.040]  biosciences so they're so they're a biomedical company and he's having amazing results with it
[01:38:49.040 --> 01:38:57.360]  now he's using like pharmaceutical grade nutrients uh ag nutrients so he he tests bi-weekly he looks
[01:38:57.440 --> 01:39:04.640]  at where where the soil sample is and determines what's what's out of balance and then amends it
[01:39:05.360 --> 01:39:12.400]  pretty much every other week so that would be like again another form of epigenetic crop steering
[01:39:13.200 --> 01:39:18.880]  i i can't i can't not like him i can't not say anything bad about what he's doing because the
[01:39:18.880 --> 01:39:25.280]  results speak for themselves now this is brand new i mean you know the concept of epigenetic
[01:39:25.280 --> 01:39:31.520]  steering has been around for a long time but the the concept of trying to apply it to a high cash
[01:39:31.520 --> 01:39:37.920]  crop is relatively new and unfortunately you know we've been under prohibition since the what 30s
[01:39:37.920 --> 01:39:44.400]  and before then we did not have the kind of tech we do now that we could actually you know sap tests
[01:39:45.040 --> 01:39:51.520]  leaf tissue tests all these things that can we can start compiling data to to really try to figure
[01:39:51.600 --> 01:39:57.600]  out what is going on on this level and you know again as a as a biologist a soil biologist
[01:39:58.240 --> 01:40:04.080]  every white paper i read just makes me feel like how little i really know about what's going on and
[01:40:04.080 --> 01:40:10.880]  and forces me to dive down deeper so it's it's new um i would tend to think that over the next
[01:40:10.880 --> 01:40:15.600]  three to five years um there's going to be a tremendous amount of information especially for
[01:40:15.600 --> 01:40:20.960]  the cannabis industry or the hemp industry because yeah we know for a fact that you can
[01:40:20.960 --> 01:40:26.640]  stress the hemp plant and it'll it'll it'll produce thc now i was working with these these cats down
[01:40:26.640 --> 01:40:35.680]  in santa fe community college um a friend of mine luke spangenberg unfortunately hi i was hiking uh
[01:40:35.680 --> 01:40:43.120]  missed a step and uh passed away like this spring which was horribly detrimental to the industry but
[01:40:44.080 --> 01:40:48.240]  another associate to his uh when i was visiting luke and doing some work
[01:40:49.120 --> 01:40:55.920]  on algae um he introduced me to this other uh god i forget what his title was but i basically said to
[01:40:55.920 --> 01:41:02.800]  him hey you know i know that there's a certain enzyme that is occurring um in the plant production
[01:41:02.800 --> 01:41:09.840]  at certain phases that is pushing thc over the limit for for hemp and i'm working with a number
[01:41:09.920 --> 01:41:15.360]  of hemp farmers back east so he laughed at me and i said well why are you laughing and he
[01:41:15.360 --> 01:41:22.400]  brought me a picture um of a you know like those three chalkboards wide where you start with this
[01:41:22.400 --> 01:41:28.720]  formula on one side and it just fills the whole three chalkboards up and there's so many variables
[01:41:28.720 --> 01:41:35.680]  like the sun the moon this the clouds the the temperature the barometric pressure um insects
[01:41:35.680 --> 01:41:41.520]  nutrient deficiency nutrient overload all of these things steer toward the increased production
[01:41:41.520 --> 01:41:49.440]  of thc and it was just like oh my god i just asked the impossible question um so again you know this
[01:41:49.440 --> 01:41:55.360]  is this is something that's almost going to get into the point where you have an ai driving or
[01:41:55.360 --> 01:42:00.960]  taking data point um and telling you okay you're going the wrong way or you're going to be okay
[01:42:00.960 --> 01:42:06.880]  harvest at this point that's so funny i just got to jump in and say it's so funny that you say that
[01:42:06.880 --> 01:42:11.280]  because that was kind of like where a lot of these conversations have been going around like the tech
[01:42:11.280 --> 01:42:16.080]  and the ai with the plants and it's like we have this regenerative cannabis movement and then
[01:42:16.080 --> 01:42:22.480]  there's this other side that's like ai collecting data points and it's really a fascinating time i'm
[01:42:22.480 --> 01:42:29.200]  a board member of the ethical data alliance and um we have been working on these different pilots
[01:42:29.200 --> 01:42:34.080]  and we were just kind of outlining more of the pilots for 2021 and one of the ones i really want
[01:42:34.080 --> 01:42:41.280]  to see on there is some of these more regenerative um you know collecting regenerative data points
[01:42:41.280 --> 01:42:46.080]  because you know it's amazing to see we can see the end product we see that the terpenes are way
[01:42:46.080 --> 01:42:50.560]  higher we see all these different things but it's like there's no way to compare and contrast that
[01:42:50.560 --> 01:42:54.640]  data and i'm sure you've seen amazing things i mean there's just so many white papers how do we
[01:42:54.640 --> 01:43:00.160]  compare and contrast these different things so i'm super interested in anybody that wants to
[01:43:00.160 --> 01:43:06.880]  jump on or join the ethical data alliance group is the idea is to keep it in kind of on the
[01:43:06.880 --> 01:43:11.920]  blockchain in a decentralized way that we can start to you know stamp these different data
[01:43:11.920 --> 01:43:17.440]  pieces and then also start to create reports back on those different things so if you're interested
[01:43:17.920 --> 01:43:24.880]  or um i think maybe um peter that uh i think maybe dale hunt had reached out to you and angela bacca
[01:43:24.880 --> 01:43:30.320]  about potentially uh doing a future cannabis some conversations around the work that we're doing with
[01:43:30.320 --> 01:43:37.200]  the ethical data alliance so we can start to you know proof some of this stuff at the end i'm glad
[01:43:37.200 --> 01:43:44.480]  we actually had we just quickly we had our first uh conversation scheduled and then uh i think dale
[01:43:44.480 --> 01:43:49.920]  got the time zone wrong because he was in arizona so yeah we're we're gonna we it's being planned
[01:43:49.920 --> 01:43:56.720]  we'll we'll reschedule it and uh you know it's like setting the table the overview of that
[01:43:56.720 --> 01:44:04.240]  ethical data alliance and then like the technology blockchain side of it the um science side the
[01:44:04.240 --> 01:44:08.560]  cultivation side so there are a bunch of conversations that are going to be had uh on
[01:44:08.560 --> 01:44:13.920]  yeah there's at least like i think five different topics of like panels that we could do just with
[01:44:13.920 --> 01:44:19.920]  our advisory boards and our board members alone we have some pretty fascinating um people and then
[01:44:19.920 --> 01:44:24.720]  i think bringing in people who are interested i mean i'm realizing that as far as advisory boards
[01:44:24.720 --> 01:44:29.360]  like we don't even really have like a regenerative agriculture advisory board and i think that
[01:44:29.360 --> 01:44:34.080]  you know like layton i would love to have some of these people who you know are you know kind
[01:44:34.080 --> 01:44:38.080]  of leading that movement um maybe maybe we need to form another advisory board
[01:44:38.960 --> 01:44:44.160]  at the end i was actually going to bring up the fact that my day job you know my night job
[01:44:44.160 --> 01:44:51.280]  obviously is basically spreading the good word of regenerative cannabis in restricted states and
[01:44:51.280 --> 01:44:58.560]  basically running a collective but my day job is working in healthcare ai as a i'm you know not to
[01:44:58.560 --> 01:45:04.480]  brag myself but you know i'm an autodidact and so i basically self-taught myself into basically being
[01:45:04.480 --> 01:45:10.880]  a world-class hacker so i work with large data sets and healthcare ai like like tens of millions
[01:45:10.880 --> 01:45:16.800]  of patients and so we've been taking that ability to process and basically do predictive and
[01:45:16.800 --> 01:45:23.120]  prescriptive analysis on people and we're applying that tech currently to our collective growths
[01:45:23.120 --> 01:45:29.360]  by standardizing and modularizing our growth setup so that way and then collecting all data points
[01:45:29.360 --> 01:45:36.880]  humidity temperature um soil content soil uh carrying field capacity collecting every single
[01:45:36.880 --> 01:45:42.880]  data point that we can while eliminating all the variables we can so that and running the same gear
[01:45:42.880 --> 01:45:47.760]  that way we could actually get real numbers behind the data while controlling for all
[01:45:47.760 --> 01:45:54.240]  environmental factors that are humanly possible during an indoor situation well i got i got
[01:45:54.240 --> 01:45:59.040]  something for you guys um i'm working with the club you want to talk we can talk about that
[01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:04.160]  i want to talk to you i want yeah i think this is exciting because i want to hear what your
[01:46:04.160 --> 01:46:09.120]  questions are like especially late and like what what are your questions what is it yeah bring
[01:46:09.120 --> 01:46:15.920]  bring the juicy stuff all right so you put your seatbelt on sweetie uh there's this company out of
[01:46:15.920 --> 01:46:26.560]  brazil that's preparing a instrument that's to be installed in fields and it basically has the
[01:46:26.560 --> 01:46:35.520]  ability to measure barometric pressure uh solar days wind direction temperature soil temperature
[01:46:35.520 --> 01:46:42.640]  soil ph soil uh moisture content across the board it is once you set it up you set it up with your
[01:46:42.640 --> 01:46:50.560]  phone um in its radio signal back to a hub up to the cloud um and so once once these things are set
[01:46:50.560 --> 01:46:58.080]  up all over the place now you got data you can crunch with ai um and and again it's safe because
[01:46:58.080 --> 01:47:04.080]  it'll be your cloud so you could choose to share it with with a blockchain platform or you could
[01:47:04.080 --> 01:47:09.120]  choose to you know hold it hold it to yourself for your own knowledge but these are going to create
[01:47:09.120 --> 01:47:16.480]  data points that are going to drive these kinds of um pieces of information that will allow us to
[01:47:16.480 --> 01:47:23.200]  intelligently in real time make hard decisions about whether to whether to call or whether to
[01:47:23.200 --> 01:47:30.320]  let it go a little bit longer or whether to harvest um so yeah their their tech is relatively new um
[01:47:30.320 --> 01:47:35.680]  i was supposed to get a unit anytime now um they actually i think they're going to send me a couple
[01:47:35.680 --> 01:47:40.240]  of them so if you're interested i'd be more than happy to get one in your hands as well
[01:47:40.240 --> 01:47:43.920]  um so that we can start collecting this information and beta testing your products
[01:47:45.200 --> 01:47:50.560]  i would love exciting yeah super exciting i love that i think that it's so important i mean i know
[01:47:50.560 --> 01:47:55.520]  that we have all these different pieces um i would be curious to hear what other questions
[01:47:55.520 --> 01:48:01.600]  you have but i do see maybe leaf is going to say something or is it yeah i was just thinking
[01:48:01.600 --> 01:48:08.640]  just to back up to the topic of epigenetic steering to um i was just for creating like a
[01:48:08.640 --> 01:48:15.840]  bigger bigger picture context because layton had been mentioning earlier how um whatever you know
[01:48:16.480 --> 01:48:22.640]  parameter delving into all of a sudden you realize how little you know and so i think it's it's really
[01:48:22.640 --> 01:48:27.120]  inspiring to hear about the kind of you know like the data analysis that you're working with kill
[01:48:27.520 --> 01:48:32.560]  these like new tools coming out or many you know these parameters like humidity you know air you
[01:48:32.560 --> 01:48:36.080]  know gas concentrations there's all these things you can measure but when we think about something
[01:48:36.080 --> 01:48:42.240]  like epigenetic steering and like um you know trying to trying to actually understand what's
[01:48:42.240 --> 01:48:47.440]  going on in that situation you know if we think about like mechanistically the the you know the
[01:48:47.440 --> 01:48:52.160]  theory of like you have a plant growing its genome is expressing a certain way and then some external
[01:48:52.160 --> 01:48:58.240]  stimulus causes the strand of dna to be altered by like methylation or something like that where
[01:48:58.240 --> 01:49:03.840]  then some physical change to the you know the genome of the individual organism occurs and then
[01:49:03.840 --> 01:49:09.600]  that changes the way the dna is expressed like trying to pinpoint what's going on there that's
[01:49:09.600 --> 01:49:13.680]  like uh it's like a whole different type of scientific frontier but that there might be
[01:49:13.680 --> 01:49:18.800]  the abilities and the capabilities to actually analyze that thing coming up too with you know
[01:49:18.800 --> 01:49:25.200]  emerging metagenomics technology and you know and then the metabolomics and you know what's in
[01:49:25.200 --> 01:49:30.080]  the genome what's being expressed what you know and then what microbes are in the soil with the
[01:49:30.080 --> 01:49:36.960]  plants and how are they influencing that and you know these kind of microbial plant interactions
[01:49:36.960 --> 01:49:42.480]  that we talk about what are the you know the base level mechanisms of that so that's a whole
[01:49:42.480 --> 01:49:47.200]  other angle that a lot of this you know big data stuff could go with understanding regenerative
[01:49:47.200 --> 01:49:53.520]  agriculture processes well i was actually we're thinking about planning on using it to basically
[01:49:53.520 --> 01:50:00.000]  um decide figure out generational drift so you know essentially how many generations does it take
[01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:06.960]  under a certain uh environmental pressure would it take for a plant to epigenetically change like if
[01:50:06.960 --> 01:50:12.640]  i decided to grow indoors but always keep my lights at least 48 inches away from my plants instead of
[01:50:12.640 --> 01:50:18.720]  the 6 to 12 that is mandated like with that level of low light how many generations would it take for
[01:50:18.720 --> 01:50:25.520]  for a plant to naturally adjust to that and react poorly to a um what would normally be an optimal
[01:50:25.520 --> 01:50:30.080]  you know environment like i'm always interested in how many generations it takes at least for cannabis
[01:50:30.640 --> 01:50:35.040]  to really actually make have enough genetic drift to make changes like that
[01:50:35.840 --> 01:50:41.600]  so what's one thing i definitely want to point people to uh kind of echoing uh there's definitely
[01:50:41.600 --> 01:50:47.040]  a lot of people that are seeing this on the on the phenotypical expression and this is something
[01:50:47.040 --> 01:50:52.160]  too is like usually when you're looking at like for the first time now we can actually like observe
[01:50:52.160 --> 01:50:56.480]  what's going on we kind of go back to like mendelian genetics like the notion gene was
[01:50:56.480 --> 01:51:02.080]  determined to describe some trait but even before we knew the actual like mechanism before we even
[01:51:02.080 --> 01:51:08.080]  even knew that there was an aperiodic crystal um which which pretty much which which was defined by
[01:51:08.080 --> 01:51:12.800]  i believe it was um i believe it was in schrodinger's essay what is life but yeah before we
[01:51:12.800 --> 01:51:18.320]  need to buy the bio the biochemistry behind all the concepts so it's amazing now with some of the
[01:51:18.320 --> 01:51:24.000]  new technologies uh especially with dna sequencing where now we can actually do a long read single
[01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:28.960]  molecule sequencing a lot of the techniques using developed by oxford and anna poor um we can
[01:51:28.960 --> 01:51:34.800]  actually preserve the resolution of the epigenome or how how open or closed to clarify when we talk
[01:51:34.800 --> 01:51:41.120]  about epigenetics you know epi is like the prefix of the word epi means above and genetics means
[01:51:41.120 --> 01:51:46.240]  genome is all so what we're doing is we're talking about whether um so dna is pretty interesting
[01:51:46.240 --> 01:51:52.480]  because um dna isn't just the strand itself you have these proteins that actually um the dna strand
[01:51:52.480 --> 01:51:56.880]  coils around they're called histones um they kind of look like these little kind of like little like
[01:51:56.880 --> 01:52:01.360]  marbles almost kind of packed together these elements these actually have tails and based
[01:52:01.360 --> 01:52:06.240]  upon whether these histones are methylated or acetylated it'll affect how open or closed
[01:52:06.800 --> 01:52:12.400]  um the dna strand is there's and anyone who wants to kind of just dive into it um definitely could
[01:52:12.400 --> 01:52:17.600]  be a good kind of starting point if you want to learn more about when someone says certain words
[01:52:17.600 --> 01:52:22.080]  and you know what is actually the meaning behind these concepts so some really interesting research
[01:52:22.080 --> 01:52:30.640]  by christopher j grass at harvard um he did actually a fair bit of work on the cannabis genome
[01:52:30.640 --> 01:52:35.600]  looking at some of the differences in the biosynthesis pathways a lot of the pre a lot
[01:52:35.600 --> 01:52:41.680]  of the precursors so we understand that the pathways between um what separates uh delta 9 thc
[01:52:41.680 --> 01:52:49.040]  and uh and uh cbd is that you have a precursor uh that's all all of the tolic acid so you have
[01:52:49.040 --> 01:52:56.720]  pretty much this enzyme that is going to modify it into a cannabijerolic acid um and then either
[01:52:56.720 --> 01:53:02.640]  what happens is you have one pathway which takes it down to thc which is the thca synthase or one
[01:53:02.640 --> 01:53:08.160]  pathway it takes it down the cbd pathway the cbda synthase what's amazing is they can actually look
[01:53:08.160 --> 01:53:14.720]  at different strains of the plants you know the notion whether this plant has the basically the
[01:53:14.720 --> 01:53:19.680]  like basically the genetics for where it's going to be more producing more thc or whether it's
[01:53:19.680 --> 01:53:26.960]  going to be producing more cbd what's remarkable is that um the position of these of these genes
[01:53:26.960 --> 01:53:35.040]  uh genes the th uh the thcas which and the cbdas varies in position on their genomes
[01:53:35.040 --> 01:53:41.280]  uh based upon the plant has been bred to be more dominant thc expression or more dominant cbd
[01:53:41.280 --> 01:53:47.440]  expression um so really if you want to dive into it um if you google this i'll kind of just uh
[01:53:47.440 --> 01:53:51.680]  give it to you and i probably hit it up to peter and he can put it in the show notes or something
[01:53:51.680 --> 01:53:58.560]  but um if you google long read nanopore cdna sequencing and direct dna methylation detection
[01:53:58.560 --> 01:54:04.960]  resolves copy number debate and cannabis that's a bit of a mouthful but if you look up uh give you
[01:54:04.960 --> 01:54:11.600]  the researcher because that's probably easier to find uh christopher j grassa he's over at harvard
[01:54:11.600 --> 01:54:15.920]  university and he's been working with hemp gene uh he's been working with hemp gene and university
[01:54:15.920 --> 01:54:22.480]  of minnesota and the salk institute to investigate this so uh chris christopher j grassa uh if you
[01:54:22.480 --> 01:54:29.600]  google um if you go to offer nanopore um and google in their resources google cannabis i think it's one
[01:54:29.600 --> 01:54:33.120]  of the first ones to come up it's a little heady but the idea is they pretty much worked out
[01:54:33.840 --> 01:54:39.760]  you know between these different you know like the same species but the reality in general is that
[01:54:39.760 --> 01:54:44.160]  it's bred to be this varietal based upon you know whether it's producing more thc to cbd and
[01:54:44.160 --> 01:54:48.400]  literally the genes are located in different parts of the chromosome in these varietals and
[01:54:48.400 --> 01:54:52.160]  that's literally what's kind of happening is you and what's really interesting too in plants
[01:54:52.800 --> 01:54:57.840]  uh you have these things called transposons uh where parts of the genome will move around
[01:54:57.840 --> 01:55:02.640]  they're called transposes uh barb mcclintock actually discovered it and won a nobel prize for
[01:55:02.640 --> 01:55:08.000]  it so yeah once you start cutting down the rabbit hole like the kind of the funny joke with biology
[01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:12.960]  is like yeah so this is how it works except but we're learning more and more about this as we
[01:55:12.960 --> 01:55:16.720]  have the technologies to bring resolution to what's going on so i'm just going to drop that
[01:55:16.720 --> 01:55:19.440]  little nugget and i'll probably send the link over to peter so we can drop it in the chat
[01:55:20.320 --> 01:55:25.600]  nice nicely said craig yeah this is why these guys are my friends they could talk over my head
[01:55:27.760 --> 01:55:34.320]  but uh another thing uh killmonger uh back to your original question so um i've been you know
[01:55:34.320 --> 01:55:40.160]  working with a few breeders for a minute and one of them that i really had a lot of respect for
[01:55:40.800 --> 01:55:47.120]  um basically told me that he he had this this hybrid that he really loved that didn't do well
[01:55:47.760 --> 01:55:54.320]  um where he was growing and so what he basically did was he he put uh you know a bunch of them out
[01:55:54.320 --> 01:56:00.160]  i think it was like 20 plants um and let them the males and the females would co-mingle and it took
[01:56:00.160 --> 01:56:05.680]  seven generations which is kind of an interesting there's so many things about seven generations
[01:56:05.680 --> 01:56:12.480]  both biblical and otherwise um but he said after seven generations they were fantastic where he
[01:56:12.480 --> 01:56:18.560]  grew them um and i forgot i think he was in oregon in an area where they had um you know a lot of fog
[01:56:18.560 --> 01:56:24.800]  and so there was some issues as far as you know powdery mildew all kinds of issues and but after
[01:56:24.800 --> 01:56:30.480]  seven generations of growing wild so he never touched them he just let them grow fall grow fall
[01:56:30.880 --> 01:56:38.400]  fall for seven generations then harvested the seeds and then started calling the males and
[01:56:38.400 --> 01:56:44.320]  letting the females grow out and had wonderful results i have one other anecdotal uh comment
[01:56:44.320 --> 01:56:50.400]  that a person told me was that it took about three generations at the very beginning you know
[01:56:50.400 --> 01:56:56.480]  to stabilize the line f f3 i think is what they call it um to really start to stabilize the drift
[01:56:57.200 --> 01:57:01.840]  so hopefully that helped answer that question um were there any other questions out there i mean
[01:57:01.840 --> 01:57:09.120]  guys should we let this roll on or what do you think i mean if there's more to talk about
[01:57:10.080 --> 01:57:16.160]  i'm just eating some golden beets and fish sticks i was actually going to ask the question about how
[01:57:16.160 --> 01:57:21.840]  the removal of pests during indoor growing because like you brought up earlier about how
[01:57:21.840 --> 01:57:26.880]  pest attack plants that can't get eaten by anything else it basically returns that organic
[01:57:26.880 --> 01:57:33.440]  matter to the soil does removing the pest almost like removing the bees from our you know agricultural
[01:57:33.440 --> 01:57:40.400]  system does that is that when it comes to indoor growing am i in an effort to try to save myself
[01:57:40.400 --> 01:57:46.240]  work am i actually hurting my yields in a sense that like you need a little bit of adversity
[01:57:46.880 --> 01:57:49.040]  i don't you know maybe i'm not explaining it correctly
[01:57:53.530 --> 01:58:00.010]  to answer your question um diversity is okay but imbalance is not and you have imbalance if you
[01:58:00.010 --> 01:58:07.450]  have an abundance of one certain pest so again in nature you're gonna have all of these things
[01:58:07.450 --> 01:58:14.810]  pathogenic uh mutualistic um you know whether they're they're an insect or a fungi or or a
[01:58:14.810 --> 01:58:20.490]  bacteria but they're all kept in balance they're kept in sync so what you're really looking to do
[01:58:20.490 --> 01:58:27.210]  is get closer to a balance where you don't have those and the only way that i know to do that
[01:58:27.210 --> 01:58:35.370]  is again is to you know get some really good biologically active compost hopefully composted
[01:58:35.370 --> 01:58:39.370]  with the cannabis plant so that again you're getting all of the things that are related to
[01:58:39.370 --> 01:58:44.890]  the cannabis plant both bacteria you know both biologically as well as nutrient driven and that
[01:58:44.890 --> 01:58:51.930]  should help strengthen up um the plants you know the next generation of plants but for for right now
[01:58:52.570 --> 01:58:57.450]  you know now you're in what's called combat mode so that's you know that's not where you're supposed
[01:58:57.450 --> 01:59:02.650]  to be the farmer should be being a part of the plant uh being a part of the process of the plants
[01:59:02.650 --> 01:59:08.250]  growing um not fighting you know water or pests so hopefully that answered craig there's a couple
[01:59:08.250 --> 01:59:12.810]  people that have raised hands can you bring them up sure then
[01:59:15.370 --> 01:59:22.330]  hi um my name's michael and uh on that same kind of topic actually um when it comes to what may
[01:59:22.330 --> 01:59:29.930]  be pests i've been doing a indoor uh living soil for a while and got a pretty good handle on most
[01:59:29.930 --> 01:59:36.490]  everything i've studied um elaine's courses doing um you know followed a lot of your stuff latent but
[01:59:37.210 --> 01:59:43.370]  i have a problem with pill bugs i don't know if it's fully a problem but they just they they run
[01:59:43.370 --> 01:59:48.810]  rampant and they're only really a problem for like usually like starts or sometimes when i first
[01:59:48.810 --> 01:59:52.570]  transplant stuff and there's not a lot of other things and then the rest of the time they're
[01:59:52.570 --> 01:59:59.450]  eating a lot of stuff but they just like reproduce like crazy well you're not the first person with
[01:59:59.450 --> 02:00:06.730]  this problem uh joshua stevesland has an amazingly hilarious uh instagram story about just
[02:00:06.730 --> 02:00:12.330]  that where the pill bug i follow him but yeah he they took over his grow and then all of a sudden
[02:00:12.330 --> 02:00:18.170]  his spiders came in and they took over his grow but the pill bugs went away and then eventually
[02:00:18.170 --> 02:00:23.450]  the spiders went away now the same thing is happening in a grow that i uh engineered the
[02:00:23.450 --> 02:00:30.330]  soil and helped inoculate in uh parachute colorado i think they're bff on instagram and
[02:00:30.330 --> 02:00:35.690]  they're going through a similar outbreak of these pill bugs and they tried putting sticky tape on
[02:00:35.690 --> 02:00:42.010]  the top of the uh rows so that the bugs would come up there and get stuck and that helped but wendy
[02:00:42.010 --> 02:00:47.130]  you familiar with sonibus on instagram i know when i follow wendy too i went to the regenerative
[02:00:47.130 --> 02:00:54.650]  cannabis conference and and uh and humboldt last year and um and got to kind of meet a lot of you
[02:00:54.650 --> 02:01:01.050]  and that kind of stuff so yeah so when he's working on it with j dom and and i'm right now
[02:01:01.050 --> 02:01:06.570]  um so i would expect that you'll see something from her yeah i expect to see something from her
[02:01:06.570 --> 02:01:11.370]  probably pretty soon and so just keep your eyes open but yeah that's an issue but as long as
[02:01:11.370 --> 02:01:15.610]  they're not chewing on your plant and if they are starting to attack your seedlings put some more
[02:01:15.610 --> 02:01:20.650]  cover crops give them food to keep them right exactly that's what i've experienced is only like
[02:01:20.650 --> 02:01:25.210]  when after i've harvested and some other stuff will come out and i'll put new cuts in there like
[02:01:25.210 --> 02:01:29.770]  they'll they'll start with the bod but once they get established and i could drop some some other
[02:01:29.770 --> 02:01:34.570]  leaves and i'll put you know got some mulch and stuff they they seem they you know they don't seem
[02:01:34.570 --> 02:01:39.370]  to mess with the plants and stuff then um i've started they've definitely when i've done some
[02:01:39.370 --> 02:01:46.570]  seedling starts like they've demolished some of those but um but okay oh i will definitely uh
[02:01:46.570 --> 02:01:52.250]  keep hope that she uh she has something uh something in there because like it's just kind
[02:01:52.250 --> 02:01:58.890]  of i've vacuumed above this last time i must have vacuumed out so many and like i'm just flipping
[02:01:58.890 --> 02:02:06.090]  the flower again and they're like they've reproduced like crazy well this is great it gives me something
[02:02:06.090 --> 02:02:11.530]  to give wendy a hard time about yeah so she gave me a hard time about doing that that horizontal
[02:02:11.530 --> 02:02:17.930]  soil system and putting up a video so i can now i can harass her back thank you you're welcome yeah
[02:02:17.930 --> 02:02:23.370]  i love all your guys's stuff i appreciate it so if i could piggyback on mikhail's question
[02:02:23.930 --> 02:02:29.610]  what do you think is the driving force that uh creates a pill bug over infestation
[02:02:29.930 --> 02:02:36.330]  it's an imbalance so there's there's too much of a certain nutrient that they want that's causing
[02:02:36.330 --> 02:02:41.610]  them to reproduce think about it this way prey predator everything in nature goes through these
[02:02:41.610 --> 02:02:46.810]  phases of prey predator so the prey all of a sudden multiply to a point that they bring in
[02:02:46.810 --> 02:02:52.330]  the predators the predators come in wipe out the prey it's called the reset it's it's it's the ebb
[02:02:52.330 --> 02:02:58.090]  and flow of of all life on this planet so obviously there's something in that soil system
[02:02:59.050 --> 02:03:04.170]  and this would be this would be great like if if if joshua had had taken a soil sample and could
[02:03:04.170 --> 02:03:09.770]  say hey this is my nutritional value or my chemistry value at that point when i had that that
[02:03:09.770 --> 02:03:15.690]  imbalance and had these guys get out of control that would be incredible and i've asked uh i've
[02:03:15.690 --> 02:03:20.810]  asked for soil samples from bff and hopefully hopefully they actually took them and sent them
[02:03:20.810 --> 02:03:28.730]  out but that would be a good indicator of of or a way to start um you know understanding what that
[02:03:28.730 --> 02:03:36.010]  imbalance was that caused that outbreak or that incredible plume do you know of a resource where
[02:03:36.010 --> 02:03:41.690]  someone has gone through and provided like that documentation they start to do the deep dive and
[02:03:41.690 --> 02:03:46.570]  you know they say okay this is like the first question i ask and they kind of maybe go through
[02:03:47.370 --> 02:03:56.090]  to where they start to uh arrive at what they find is the true cause and then step back up as far as
[02:03:56.090 --> 02:04:01.130]  what they do with remediation you know for someone like me as a newbie you know if i see something
[02:04:01.130 --> 02:04:05.370]  out of balance even a chemical imbalance i'm probably going to have to toss it to the group
[02:04:05.370 --> 02:04:10.730]  because i just don't know enough but how would you help someone like myself become better set up to
[02:04:10.730 --> 02:04:18.010]  can answer those more complex system problems well let's start with michael please michael take
[02:04:18.010 --> 02:04:25.370]  a soil test send it off to logan labs have the i think it's the advanced complete test at 60 bucks
[02:04:25.930 --> 02:04:31.530]  and now we'll have some data point and if bff does it we have another data point now we can start to
[02:04:31.530 --> 02:04:38.890]  correlate what's going on and i have some i've taken soil sets um i've worked with the the loop
[02:04:38.890 --> 02:04:45.210]  from the t lab in eureka and he sends it off to i believe it's a and l labs not logan labs
[02:04:46.010 --> 02:04:51.130]  but um like i have done that and mostly most of the stuff i've researched about pill bugs is that
[02:04:51.130 --> 02:04:56.890]  they they're kind of like they're another one of those big like organic matter decomposers
[02:04:57.610 --> 02:05:05.290]  and so but i that would be interesting to see if maybe it was a a nutrient um and there's a
[02:05:05.290 --> 02:05:14.010]  nutrient aspect to that there's always something else i mean yes organic matter is most prevalently
[02:05:14.010 --> 02:05:20.810]  used across the industry so everybody would have a pill bug problem right right so there's definitely
[02:05:20.810 --> 02:05:28.250]  something beyond just organic matter that's driving that uh that that um rapid reproduction
[02:05:28.250 --> 02:05:34.090]  and so that would be that would be my answer to you that if if if this was an industry-wide issue
[02:05:34.090 --> 02:05:38.890]  we could we could kind of say okay it's got to be the organic matter but it isn't it's it's pretty
[02:05:38.890 --> 02:05:44.250]  it's pretty specialized this is only the like fourth or fifth time i've heard of roly-poly's
[02:05:44.250 --> 02:05:52.730]  getting out of balance so yes and and a and l i work with them here in oxnard but um logan logan
[02:05:52.730 --> 02:05:59.530]  does uh a more comprehensive um test package than them i mean if you use a and l and you get all the
[02:05:59.530 --> 02:06:05.130]  same thing it's the test is going to cost you probably two to three times more whereas logan
[02:06:05.130 --> 02:06:10.730]  is is right dialed dialed into doing the broad spectrum stuff large scale yeah and i've thought
[02:06:10.730 --> 02:06:18.810]  about doing that i just use luke here to also have like a resource to like ping the to learn more
[02:06:18.810 --> 02:06:24.330]  about how like reading the tests and stuff i've been wanting to think about switching it because
[02:06:24.330 --> 02:06:29.290]  i hear everybody talking about logan labs on you know most of the people i follow and so
[02:06:30.650 --> 02:06:35.610]  i have to you know i get one of those yeah yeah this is once again like kind of forcing
[02:06:36.330 --> 02:06:42.250]  more work out of me um because i have run into i get test reports sent to me all the time because
[02:06:42.250 --> 02:06:46.890]  it's it's complicated to read them and it's even complicated for me because every lab is doing it
[02:06:46.890 --> 02:06:52.090]  different so i'm like oh man this is a different format i can't just look through it and i gotta
[02:06:52.090 --> 02:06:57.050]  you know like print it and then pull different pieces out and look at the different aspects and
[02:06:57.050 --> 02:07:02.810]  all right how are you is this a modified morgan you know is this a spray is it a you know malik
[02:07:02.810 --> 02:07:08.650]  three so it really complicates things yeah so again you know i stress this a lot if you're
[02:07:08.650 --> 02:07:13.690]  going to use the lab stick with them right and in your case you're fine to stick with a and l but
[02:07:13.690 --> 02:07:17.930]  you're just going to spend a lot more money to get the the full gamut of tests that are needed
[02:07:17.930 --> 02:07:23.290]  to really look at this shit okay yeah i mean i've only been doing started doing the soil testing
[02:07:23.930 --> 02:07:31.290]  in the last year so i mean it's like and this actually i just expanded my stuff and like re
[02:07:32.490 --> 02:07:37.130]  rebuilt my soil just the previous round so it's all kind of fresh so it wouldn't be a big deal
[02:07:37.130 --> 02:07:42.410]  for me to to try and like switch and then you know stick with something else especially if they give
[02:07:42.410 --> 02:07:51.050]  me more information because i am i am super into all of it and and trying to to you know trying to
[02:07:51.050 --> 02:07:56.970]  master how to to do it all for myself so it would be good to have more information if that's
[02:07:56.970 --> 02:08:00.650]  possible yeah data is key man i mean look at facebook
[02:08:02.970 --> 02:08:09.050]  hey speaking of data just some housekeeping stuff here on sexy soil living soils conversation for
[02:08:10.010 --> 02:08:15.850]  um i'm ed and that's layton and that's peter and that's life and that's craig and uh the
[02:08:15.850 --> 02:08:21.850]  moderators would love it if you would follow us we do this room uh thursday from four to six um i
[02:08:21.850 --> 02:08:26.810]  followed everyone in here today if you're finding value or you just dig each other please follow us
[02:08:26.810 --> 02:08:33.130]  and follow each other um and there's been a lot of great information out today and uh we just want to
[02:08:33.130 --> 02:08:38.570]  say thank you for being here and um sean we kind of skipped over you i know you chimed in but did
[02:08:38.570 --> 02:08:46.740]  you have a specific question you needed to answer today i actually did not have a question for some
[02:08:46.740 --> 02:08:52.820]  odd reason i thought this this came up in my contacts or sorry my calendar as a 9 30 eastern
[02:08:52.820 --> 02:09:00.660]  time conference so i completely missed it so i'm not sure where my tech savvy failed me but as far
[02:09:00.660 --> 02:09:05.300]  as having an actual conversation no um i really don't have a conference i don't really have a
[02:09:05.300 --> 02:09:10.260]  question since i missed the entire content here you know just the standard thanks to everybody i
[02:09:10.260 --> 02:09:17.700]  mean i enjoy learning so much from all you guys from all the different platforms and we uh if
[02:09:17.700 --> 02:09:22.420]  anyone has a question raise your hand we've been going since about four o'clock and if you want to
[02:09:22.420 --> 02:09:27.780]  keep the conversation going that's fine with me and i know i just texted late and late and said
[02:09:27.780 --> 02:09:32.180]  we could keep it going so if you have a question or you have another comment or you just want to
[02:09:32.180 --> 02:09:38.420]  talk amongst ourselves feel free to chime in and uh one other one other thing uh sean just
[02:09:38.420 --> 02:09:45.700]  this is being recorded on uh future cannabis projects platform so you can you can listen to
[02:09:45.700 --> 02:09:53.380]  the the whole thing recorded uh later on tonight go ahead that's a quick follow-up on we're talking
[02:09:53.380 --> 02:09:59.300]  about soil tests which is this that um as you know being someone who also some of my work is involved
[02:09:59.300 --> 02:10:03.220]  interpreting soil tests for other people if you're going to be doing lots of soil tests
[02:10:03.220 --> 02:10:09.220]  highly recommend figuring out a way to set up a spreadsheet that's easy to put the data in from
[02:10:09.220 --> 02:10:14.180]  the reports you get from the lab and then also when that spreadsheet have you know unit conversion
[02:10:14.180 --> 02:10:19.620]  factors for if they're giving you the results and you know milligrams per kilogram and you want to
[02:10:19.620 --> 02:10:26.020]  get into parts per million whatever it is it's a lot better to do that early on if you're going
[02:10:26.020 --> 02:10:30.180]  to continue to get soil tests because then it's just going to save you more work on the back end
[02:10:30.180 --> 02:10:34.820]  you know streamline your process of being able to convert the raw data you get from the lab into
[02:10:34.820 --> 02:10:38.020]  whatever you can actually interpret and you can compare to relevant values
[02:10:40.980 --> 02:10:48.920]  great advice leaf great advice all right so any other questions out there
[02:10:58.290 --> 02:11:04.370]  all right looks like it's calmed down um i don't know about you guys but i started podcasting at
[02:11:04.450 --> 02:11:09.650]  10 this morning uh did a four-hour session on future cannabis project which is probably already
[02:11:09.650 --> 02:11:16.850]  up um sun's going down here and it's been another two and a half hours and i'm pretty fried so if
[02:11:16.850 --> 02:11:23.650]  you guys are all cool we'll see you back here next week same bad time same bad channel yeah
[02:11:24.050 --> 02:11:30.690]  since we started i uh took a shower i shaved i cooked dinner i ate dinner
[02:11:35.730 --> 02:11:37.090]  lucky you multitasking
[02:11:40.370 --> 02:11:46.290]  peter uh i dropped this in the chat on the on it's on youtube but uh check your dms
[02:11:46.290 --> 02:11:51.090]  on the instagram that was the the 14 minute video when i was talking about um
[02:11:51.810 --> 02:11:56.130]  we that specific video highlighting the new technologies we can actually look at
[02:11:56.690 --> 02:11:59.810]  uh the metagenome expression but how the methylation of um
[02:12:00.690 --> 02:12:04.370]  of the cannabis chromosome will affect expression of those different gene pathways
[02:12:06.130 --> 02:12:13.090]  all right let me quickly grab it and post it yeah that's you know that's some really new
[02:12:14.210 --> 02:12:21.010]  understanding on how you know these things can can move around on the strand and and so yeah
[02:12:21.650 --> 02:12:28.370]  another part of a piece of information if you're breeding or trying to epigenetic steer that's
[02:12:28.370 --> 02:12:36.690]  critical um but again it's it's relatively new and so it's not um it's not something that's
[02:12:36.690 --> 02:12:42.610]  well studied and remember cannabis has been in in prohibition so long that we've lost years and
[02:12:42.690 --> 02:12:50.450]  years of data um so hopefully uh it remains the most studied plant on the planet in all
[02:12:51.250 --> 02:12:57.570]  human history um and therefore we can we can learn from it and hopefully all plant producers
[02:12:57.570 --> 02:13:03.890]  including big ag learn from conversations like this that they no longer need mpk and we've got
[02:13:03.890 --> 02:13:09.570]  to stop polluting our soil systems and start rebuilding them for the next generations to come
[02:13:10.450 --> 02:13:16.770]  you know it is so critical that we allow the biology to begin to filter the rain water
[02:13:16.770 --> 02:13:21.970]  so that we could actually drink groundwater again could you imagine just digging a hole and
[02:13:21.970 --> 02:13:26.770]  and scooping the water out of that hole and drinking it that's what our ancestors did and
[02:13:26.770 --> 02:13:31.490]  we can't do that anymore and you know that's a problem that's an issue i mean if our soils are
[02:13:31.490 --> 02:13:38.130]  not cleaning our water we're fucked because water is the new oil and it's probably way more valuable
[02:13:38.210 --> 02:13:44.370]  than oil moving forward so i'll shut up on that one no no no you know i was just going to say
[02:13:44.370 --> 02:13:49.890]  there is if you're interested in water and i am that's one of my reasons i'm here too is uh
[02:13:50.610 --> 02:13:55.250]  there is a room called the red line going on now i believe and it's about water security and water
[02:13:55.250 --> 02:14:02.130]  issues as having to do with uh with military issues with societal issues and that's on every
[02:14:02.130 --> 02:14:06.370]  friday night so it's probably where i'll hop to next but i will not be moderating i'll just be
[02:14:06.930 --> 02:14:11.490]  listening and um peter i wanted to thank you too for setting this up on youtube how many uh
[02:14:12.290 --> 02:14:15.570]  how many people did you have at one time listening to this conversation
[02:14:17.090 --> 02:14:26.290]  uh i think it peaked at like 250. wow nice but that's recorded with no announcement
[02:14:27.170 --> 02:14:32.690]  yeah and that's recorded so you know you watch it grow i mean that's that's the beauty of peter's
[02:14:32.690 --> 02:14:39.090]  platform is that he has such a huge worldwide audience that the views and the and the and the
[02:14:39.650 --> 02:14:45.970]  will just keep growing and growing like crazy and just well my my my thing is that in clubhouse you
[02:14:45.970 --> 02:14:52.290]  know you hear these great conversations and they're ephemeral and it's kind of like you get
[02:14:52.290 --> 02:15:00.210]  these experts who who you know aggregate in a room and just drop knowledge bombs and then
[02:15:00.850 --> 02:15:07.890]  they're like eight people watching and then there's no recorded version so that's kind of
[02:15:07.890 --> 02:15:14.610]  what i'm trying to the gap i'm trying to bridge is to like use these two tools for like what i
[02:15:14.610 --> 02:15:20.210]  love about clubhouse is people get attracted into a room and then if you're speaking you can be like
[02:15:20.210 --> 02:15:25.650]  oh like i know the guy like in the audience he's an expert in this topic that we're talking about
[02:15:25.650 --> 02:15:32.130]  like come on up to the stage and peter thank you for all the work you're doing because you really
[02:15:32.130 --> 02:15:38.930]  are providing an incredible value to the to the community as a whole and and in many ways to to
[02:15:38.930 --> 02:15:45.810]  to all future plant production and one last plug if you guys have not seen the symphony of the soil
[02:15:46.450 --> 02:15:54.050]  please it's 15 on amazon uh for the dvd you'll watch it over and over again and every time you
[02:15:54.050 --> 02:15:59.010]  watch you'll get more information out of it but the the one thing that always stuck in my mind
[02:15:59.010 --> 02:16:05.890]  with that dvd was the experiment that was done at rodale my old former stomping grounds uh where the
[02:16:05.890 --> 02:16:11.970]  gentleman poured water 100 mils into an ag three to four different agricultural systems the one on
[02:16:11.970 --> 02:16:17.570]  the left was was pure synthetic the one on the far right was pure organic the water that went into
[02:16:17.570 --> 02:16:22.450]  the pure synthetic system came out cloudy and dark all the water that went in came out of it
[02:16:23.170 --> 02:16:30.130]  on the organic side the 100 mils that went in uh seven eights three quarters of it was absorbed
[02:16:30.130 --> 02:16:38.290]  into the organic system and the water that came out was crystal clear so you know that's what our
[02:16:38.290 --> 02:16:44.610]  soil system is designed to do is filter water for us and we have disrespected our soil and that's
[02:16:44.610 --> 02:16:50.210]  why we got to make it sexy again and make it fertile and healthy so that we can all survive
[02:16:50.210 --> 02:16:57.010]  for the next seven generations amen on that amen well thank you for being here again sexy soils a
[02:16:57.010 --> 02:17:02.530]  living soils conversation for growers we will be back here next thursday and if we do something
[02:17:02.530 --> 02:17:08.290]  before that we will do it it's 4 p.m to 6 p.m pacific time thank you layton and peter and
[02:17:08.290 --> 02:17:13.410]  craig and life and thank you to all the speakers and all the folks that listened in today thank
