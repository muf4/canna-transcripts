[00:00.000 --> 00:06.320]  Look at that timing and just in the nick of time, boom, there's Sticky Lungs.
[00:08.040 --> 00:09.840]  Good morning, boys and girls.
[00:09.880 --> 00:11.200]  Brian, take it away.
[00:11.920 --> 00:12.160]  Yeah.
[00:12.160 --> 00:13.200]  Good morning, boys and girls.
[00:13.200 --> 00:14.960]  Happy Thursday to you as always.
[00:15.440 --> 00:18.040]  This has become quite the little thing in the community.
[00:18.040 --> 00:23.560]  So I'm excited to again, share the platform with somebody that, you know, shout out to Sticky Lungs.
[00:23.560 --> 00:42.000]  When we were at the Home Growers Cup in 2018, I felt like afterwards, Sticky kind of came by and mentioned Stony Jack's 420 as like somebody to keep your eye on, somebody that he felt like had the skill set and that kind of thing that it took to get to a certain place.
[00:42.000 --> 00:46.760]  And I wanted to give you a shout out here, Stony Jack's, just with your accolades alone.
[00:47.080 --> 00:49.640]  I know that you put in the work and you put in the effort.
[00:49.640 --> 00:53.400]  So it's always nice when somebody else is able to talk about your hardware.
[00:53.960 --> 00:58.240]  But for, you know, the grow off and then you were also in the Dude Grows Cup.
[00:58.640 --> 01:03.960]  So just recently here in 2020, you took home first place for potency, first place for flavor.
[01:04.240 --> 01:06.440]  2019, first place for potency.
[01:06.720 --> 01:10.240]  And the Dude Grows Cup 2017, you took home second place.
[01:10.920 --> 01:14.680]  Dude Grows Cup in 2019, you took home second place.
[01:14.920 --> 01:23.680]  And I feel like one of the maybe one of the reasons is because at least it seemed like you were hungry for knowledge, man.
[01:23.680 --> 01:36.720]  I felt like when I first met you in 2018, it was just really cool to be able to judge your cannabis and at the same time see that you were just the way you carried yourself and the way you interacted with people.
[01:36.720 --> 01:38.840]  You know, there's something different about you.
[01:38.840 --> 01:51.480]  And so it's so cool to be able to have this full circle now where we're going to be able to talk to you and pick your brain and kind of find out the growth that you've been able to achieve by just kind of putting your head down, not really caring about what's going on.
[01:51.800 --> 01:58.440]  It seemed like outside of your little world, they're taking care of your family, understanding cannabis farmer, kind of climbing that ladder.
[01:58.680 --> 02:06.720]  And then today, brother, I just want to, you know, again, give you that platform and share that so that Sticky, Layton and Peter as well.
[02:07.200 --> 02:25.200]  We're all just going to kind of pick your brain because just like when I was interviewing Bird, I feel like when you continue to win certain things, when you go back to a certain place and you continue to place in that, especially at some of the leader levels of these cannabis awards, the ones that are kind of respected from the peer group.
[02:26.000 --> 02:27.280]  There's just something to that.
[02:27.280 --> 02:34.800]  And I feel like, again, Sticky, I hope we can, you know, you can march into 2022 at some point and maybe bring back the Home Growers Cup.
[02:34.800 --> 02:40.880]  But there's a lot of things that I feel like are misguided and that kind of stuff with some of the other hardware.
[02:41.200 --> 02:47.280]  But the hardware that you are talking about, man, I feel like the industry respects and it's just going to be cool to be able to pick your brain today.
[02:47.560 --> 02:52.520]  I wanted to give a shout out to Layton here if you wanted to kind of chop it up a little bit.
[02:52.520 --> 02:58.400]  I know that you've been able to interview Sticky before and kind of pick his brain on a variety of things.
[02:58.400 --> 03:08.200]  But today I feel like this is going to be on another level because this is another man that I feel like has been able to build himself up by just staying humble and continuing to educate himself.
[03:10.840 --> 03:12.360]  Nice, looking forward to it, guys.
[03:12.880 --> 03:13.760]  Always a pleasure.
[03:14.760 --> 03:17.160]  And congratulations on all those wins, my friend.
[03:17.840 --> 03:18.320]  That's amazing.
[03:18.320 --> 03:18.800]  Thank you so much.
[03:20.560 --> 03:22.160]  Please do share your techniques.
[03:23.000 --> 03:29.240]  Yeah, so I mean, I guess I'll start with how I started in this industry.
[03:30.120 --> 03:36.320]  I'm from the South, so I know Thomas and Brian can relate.
[03:36.320 --> 03:39.200]  I was born in Georgia and raised in Mississippi.
[03:40.040 --> 03:41.920]  So strict Bible belt.
[03:43.560 --> 03:44.960]  Growing up, I was a nerd.
[03:45.800 --> 03:47.800]  I was in band, ROTC.
[03:48.320 --> 03:52.360]  I didn't really like have a clique or anything like that.
[03:52.480 --> 03:53.280]  Did my own thing.
[03:53.280 --> 03:55.320]  That's just how I read.
[03:56.120 --> 04:03.000]  And it was after I got out of the military, I was in the Marine Corps Reserves for six years.
[04:03.560 --> 04:09.120]  And after I got out, I was pondering, like, what am I going to do with my career?
[04:09.120 --> 04:10.480]  Like, what am I going to do the rest of my life?
[04:10.560 --> 04:18.600]  And joining the military and the job that I had in the military, the only thing I could really fall back on was being like a police officer.
[04:19.320 --> 04:27.320]  And no offense to the good cops out there, but not many people are excited when cops come around.
[04:27.320 --> 04:30.800]  No one's like, oh, yeah, here comes the cops, you know?
[04:31.360 --> 04:38.080]  And so that really didn't fit well with me or didn't line up with what I wanted to do personally with helping people.
[04:39.080 --> 04:49.000]  So me and my beautiful girlfriend at the time, which is now fiance, we we bounced ideas with her brother about moving to Colorado.
[04:49.880 --> 04:56.200]  It was a new green rush back in 2015 or 2014 when we started talking about it.
[04:56.200 --> 04:59.280]  And we were supposed to move mid 2014 out here.
[05:00.240 --> 05:08.840]  Fell through. Her brother had a fallen out relationship, so we didn't move in that year.
[05:09.120 --> 05:14.040]  But me and my girlfriend at the time, Chloe, we still wanted to do this.
[05:14.040 --> 05:16.840]  Like, I needed I needed something else.
[05:16.840 --> 05:21.560]  I needed to do something else besides the service industry, which is South Mississippi.
[05:21.560 --> 05:23.520]  It's pretty much hospitality and service industry.
[05:23.520 --> 05:28.160]  So we don't have any contacts out here.
[05:29.040 --> 05:35.760]  The only thing that we could think of is, hey, let's let's sell all our stuff and and see what happens.
[05:35.760 --> 05:42.080]  So we it took us about a month of having weekly weekend garage sales.
[05:42.880 --> 05:48.560]  And we just sold everything we own because we're like, well, we can't really take much.
[05:48.720 --> 05:55.120]  We had a four door car, a big hundred thirty pound dog and a cat.
[05:55.120 --> 05:57.760]  So it's pretty minimal what we can take.
[05:57.760 --> 06:06.160]  So we probably raised about seven grand in cash and we hit the road.
[06:06.160 --> 06:07.520]  We're just like, all right, we're doing this.
[06:07.520 --> 06:08.880]  Hit the road.
[06:08.880 --> 06:12.240]  Came out here July 2015.
[06:12.240 --> 06:17.440]  It was a fourth of July weekend because I remember watching fireworks here in spring.
[06:17.520 --> 06:22.240]  And luckily, we have we had a friend stationed out here.
[06:22.240 --> 06:31.360]  So we stayed with them over the weekend and we just started house hunting, just dropping in applications to houses.
[06:31.360 --> 06:32.640]  We didn't have a job.
[06:32.640 --> 06:38.240]  So we were trying to find a private landlord because we had cash, cash talk, money talks, you know.
[06:38.640 --> 06:46.080]  So we found a landlord and that's where my cannabis career actually began.
[06:46.080 --> 06:55.200]  I did grow a couple of plants in Mississippi, allegedly, and and they didn't do too hot.
[06:55.200 --> 06:56.320]  They're both males.
[06:56.320 --> 06:57.760]  But I did learn a little bit.
[06:57.760 --> 07:04.320]  But as soon as we got this house here in Colorado for the first time, the apartment for the first time, I was all right.
[07:05.280 --> 07:11.520]  I went to Attitude Seed Bank at the time because I was trying to, I got to find seed.
[07:11.520 --> 07:15.680]  And at that time, that was the hot, the hot site to order from.
[07:15.680 --> 07:21.680]  So I ordered a bunch of singles and stuff like that and ordered 4x4 tent.
[07:23.920 --> 07:31.600]  Facebook Marketplace and Craigslist have been my, my saving grace because of the lack of money.
[07:31.680 --> 07:37.280]  So I buy a lot of used equipment over new equipment and I just make it work.
[07:37.920 --> 07:41.440]  I use what I have and yeah, just make it work.
[07:42.080 --> 07:55.520]  So I actually, and I know my fiance is probably upset, but we actually had a 4x4 grow going before we had a bed here in Colorado.
[07:56.240 --> 07:59.520]  And I was, I was growing, I started deep water culture.
[07:59.840 --> 08:06.240]  That was my first, my first growth setup because I wanted to, I wanted to be scientific.
[08:06.240 --> 08:11.840]  You know, like I had the mindset coming out here that it's medical cannabis.
[08:11.840 --> 08:15.520]  So it's supposed to be the absolute best cannabis I can find anywhere.
[08:16.320 --> 08:22.480]  And now, now as time has passed, it's definitely not.
[08:23.600 --> 08:26.400]  But at that time, I had that mindset.
[08:26.400 --> 08:28.480]  So I wanted to go on the scientific approach.
[08:28.480 --> 08:40.400]  So like how is the roots growing straight into the water fascinated me and the growth rate took me by surprise.
[08:41.680 --> 08:43.760]  I was not ready for that growth rate.
[08:43.760 --> 08:49.440]  And that's kind of what started my cannabis journey, not in commercial.
[08:50.000 --> 08:58.480]  And as soon as we got settled in the house, I got my badge and I have no cannabis experience.
[08:58.480 --> 09:03.040]  So what I do have experience in is food and beverage, hospitality.
[09:03.040 --> 09:05.040]  I've been in food and beverage for 11 years.
[09:06.000 --> 09:09.120]  I know I've interviewed many people in food and beverage.
[09:09.120 --> 09:15.360]  Those people that continue to show interest usually get interviewed at least.
[09:16.320 --> 09:17.600]  So like being persistent.
[09:18.320 --> 09:20.560]  So that's what I had that mindset.
[09:20.560 --> 09:23.040]  And I made up my resume.
[09:23.600 --> 09:26.480]  I printed probably like 50 copies of it.
[09:26.480 --> 09:34.560]  And I just went to every dispensary dropping resumes and making sure I went back.
[09:34.560 --> 09:37.200]  Especially it was a dispensary that I really wanted to work at.
[09:37.200 --> 09:41.440]  I'd go check in and be like, hey, I dropped a resume off here.
[09:42.080 --> 09:43.200]  Is there a manager I could talk to?
[09:43.440 --> 09:48.480]  Just put a face with my resume because it makes it more personable.
[09:49.360 --> 09:55.760]  And you can get at least a talking to easier if you show that persistence, I think.
[09:56.800 --> 10:00.960]  And this one company gave me a chance, called me.
[10:01.760 --> 10:02.960]  I interviewed.
[10:02.960 --> 10:06.880]  And the next day he was like, well, let's see how you work.
[10:06.880 --> 10:08.640]  So I had to do a working interview.
[10:08.640 --> 10:12.400]  I don't know if that's a common thing, but I don't know the industry at this point.
[10:13.200 --> 10:15.600]  So I'm like, all right, yeah, I'm gonna work.
[10:15.600 --> 10:16.560]  I put my head down.
[10:16.560 --> 10:16.960]  I work.
[10:18.000 --> 10:18.800]  So that's what I did.
[10:18.800 --> 10:20.400]  I went in my first day.
[10:21.280 --> 10:25.600]  Oh, man, I was excited, of course, because I'm about to work with weed.
[10:26.480 --> 10:30.720]  And then this room opened up, you know, bright yellow lights, HPS lighting.
[10:31.840 --> 10:33.120]  And the plants are all yellow.
[10:33.840 --> 10:38.560]  I'm like, this is how we look like.
[10:39.520 --> 10:45.040]  And it is like, and you see all the nice pictures on Instagram, everyone shows the
[10:45.760 --> 10:47.040]  good glorious stuff.
[10:48.720 --> 10:50.080]  Because no one wants to show the bad stuff.
[10:50.080 --> 10:52.640]  But I literally walked in this room and it's yellow.
[10:52.640 --> 10:54.320]  I didn't see a hint of green.
[10:54.320 --> 10:57.040]  There's like, it smelled like death.
[10:57.040 --> 11:02.720]  There was there was a ladybug carcasses everywhere because the owner at the time was trying to
[11:02.720 --> 11:05.920]  fight off whatever pests at the time.
[11:05.920 --> 11:06.880]  They're everywhere.
[11:06.960 --> 11:09.680]  They're all in the bud, larva all on the bud.
[11:09.680 --> 11:14.960]  And I honestly was like, oh, so this is how the industry is.
[11:15.520 --> 11:21.200]  And you know, that kind of started my like, brain working like this is really how the
[11:21.200 --> 11:21.840]  industry is.
[11:22.480 --> 11:28.000]  Like, this is supposed to be the cleanest medical cannabis like this will be helping
[11:28.000 --> 11:30.720]  people but I walk into a room and it looks like this.
[11:30.720 --> 11:32.800]  But I guess I just didn't see it.
[11:32.800 --> 11:39.040]  And as time, time went on, I did learn that I walked into a shit show.
[11:39.680 --> 11:43.040]  And I was there for almost two years.
[11:43.040 --> 11:50.480]  And in that time, I learned a ton of working with nutrients, just the whole, whole commercial
[11:50.480 --> 11:50.960]  cycle.
[11:52.400 --> 11:56.240]  And that's, I've always taken being a sponge aspect.
[11:56.240 --> 11:59.600]  I, I don't, I came in here not knowing weed.
[11:59.600 --> 12:05.760]  So a lot of people know weed or gotten successful harvest and I just take in what everyone tells
[12:05.760 --> 12:06.400]  me.
[12:06.400 --> 12:11.120]  I don't take it as, as like the golden rule or anything like that.
[12:11.120 --> 12:16.560]  But it's learning everyone has a different way to get to the end process and it shows
[12:16.560 --> 12:18.080]  and it worked for everybody.
[12:19.840 --> 12:29.120]  But the, just the way, I guess the biggest disappointment is the biggest way I could
[12:29.120 --> 12:35.360]  describe the industry as on the commercial side, I would say, and I've learned that you
[12:35.360 --> 12:38.640]  do get the better quality from home growers.
[12:39.280 --> 12:44.960]  And at that time of working at the Spencery, I met our Rosen tech.
[12:44.960 --> 12:47.840]  His name was Dan, super organic guy.
[12:47.840 --> 12:54.960]  And we happened to go on a little smoke, smoke sesh one day and like he loaded his fat bowl
[12:54.960 --> 13:03.600]  of his Pakistani land race and I hit it and it was so smooth that it gave me goosebumps.
[13:03.600 --> 13:06.640]  Like I was like, Whoa, well, I'm not coughing.
[13:07.280 --> 13:08.720]  This tastes amazing.
[13:09.600 --> 13:11.520]  It, it's smooth.
[13:11.520 --> 13:14.320]  It's, it's, it's just, I was like, how'd you do this?
[13:15.120 --> 13:22.080]  And he's like, Oh man, I grow organically using like raw, raw fertilizers and stuff
[13:22.080 --> 13:22.640]  like that.
[13:23.280 --> 13:26.320]  And I'm like, Oh man, I'm, I have to change something.
[13:26.320 --> 13:31.120]  Because at that time I was using advanced nutrients with the deepwater culture.
[13:31.120 --> 13:34.000]  So one of them, anyway, I use it.
[13:34.000 --> 13:38.240]  When you say raw, are you saying the actual brand raw or just raw ingredients in general?
[13:38.800 --> 13:41.680]  Oh, like, just like brand.
[13:42.560 --> 13:43.360]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[13:43.360 --> 13:46.880]  The NPK brand, the, all the dry amendments and stuff like that.
[13:46.880 --> 13:48.880]  He was, he was into that already.
[13:48.880 --> 13:50.160]  It was 2015.
[13:50.240 --> 13:55.760]  He was, he was, he was into making his own aerated compost tea.
[13:55.760 --> 14:00.560]  That's the one that really like drew me into to starting organics.
[14:00.560 --> 14:02.160]  It was after I smoked this stuff.
[14:02.880 --> 14:07.280]  And I'm like, well, my stuff doesn't, it looks good, but it don't, it's not, it's not that
[14:08.080 --> 14:08.580]  smooth.
[14:09.040 --> 14:13.040]  And that was a big, because I do, I do consume a lot of cannabis.
[14:13.040 --> 14:14.720]  So I want it to be the best.
[14:14.720 --> 14:18.400]  And I think smoothness is a part of quality.
[14:18.960 --> 14:26.320]  So yeah, that, that just changed my whole mind track of where I'm going.
[14:26.320 --> 14:31.840]  Even though I'm growing commercially, I, I, I've always wanted to stay in the commercial
[14:31.840 --> 14:35.680]  aspect because that's the reason why I came out here was to learn the industry and then
[14:35.680 --> 14:43.760]  hopefully take it out to another state, country, wherever I go, because Colorado is a little
[14:43.760 --> 14:49.280]  saturated right now and licenses and stuff with that regards.
[14:50.080 --> 14:53.840]  But yeah, so back to growing organically.
[14:56.160 --> 14:57.760]  Dan, he, he got me on that track.
[14:57.760 --> 15:01.200]  So I started going more on the hybrid approach.
[15:01.200 --> 15:02.320]  I started researching.
[15:03.680 --> 15:07.600]  Every time you see me, I usually have like earbud in my ear.
[15:07.600 --> 15:08.880]  I'm not listening to music.
[15:08.880 --> 15:12.560]  I have some type of knowledge going into my ear.
[15:13.120 --> 15:20.000]  I've almost gotten away from music as entertainment because I'm so into this industry right now
[15:20.000 --> 15:24.640]  that I just need to soak in as much knowledge as I can from everywhere.
[15:25.440 --> 15:37.120]  So I listen to dude grows, Shaking Fire, cannabis cultivation, science, all those
[15:37.120 --> 15:37.360]  talk.
[15:37.360 --> 15:38.000]  There's so many.
[15:38.000 --> 15:40.640]  I'm not gonna, I'm not gonna stop dropping names.
[15:40.640 --> 15:41.520]  I'm gonna miss somebody.
[15:42.080 --> 15:46.960]  But I did that and it got me going like, all right, I'm gonna try this.
[15:46.960 --> 15:49.520]  But I was still a little attached to the bottle.
[15:50.080 --> 15:59.280]  I felt comfort in the bottles because it was already laid out, laid out to me to get to
[15:59.280 --> 15:59.920]  the end.
[15:59.920 --> 16:03.280]  So it was hard to break that dependency.
[16:04.160 --> 16:07.760]  So what I did, I started going more syngamic.
[16:07.760 --> 16:16.800]  So I'd have had my media, which was a cocoa, cocoa and perlite blend, 70-30 blend at home.
[16:16.800 --> 16:23.360]  And I got like the cheap Uncle Wiggy's Wiggles or whatever, or Wiggle Farm casting.
[16:24.160 --> 16:28.080]  And I started like brewing my first compost teas.
[16:28.080 --> 16:32.240]  I cut my salt nutrition down to half.
[16:33.120 --> 16:36.640]  And then I started weekly doing aerated compost tea.
[16:37.360 --> 16:44.080]  And then I could see like my flowers were looking amazing, smelling amazing.
[16:44.720 --> 16:50.480]  And this was, this is at the point where I was like, I think I entered in the cup of
[16:50.480 --> 16:52.320]  Thomas's cup, Sticky Lungs cup.
[16:52.320 --> 16:52.640]  Sorry.
[16:54.640 --> 16:56.080]  I entered in his cup.
[16:56.080 --> 17:02.320]  I forgot what strain I entered, but I was definitely in the syngamic realm.
[17:02.320 --> 17:08.720]  I wasn't completely transitioned over because I wasn't quite sold on organics.
[17:08.720 --> 17:10.400]  But yeah.
[17:10.960 --> 17:16.240]  And yeah, let's bring Sticky into the conversation because I feel like if, you know, if he was
[17:16.240 --> 17:21.040]  trying to like a Columbine, if you will, where it's, you know, the top talents coming to
[17:21.040 --> 17:25.920]  show off their local stuff at the Home Growers Cup, you know, he's mentioning you.
[17:25.920 --> 17:31.200]  So I feel like Sticky, I'd love to kind of get, pick your brain a little bit of what
[17:31.200 --> 17:32.000]  really stood out.
[17:32.000 --> 17:35.040]  And, you know, again, there's a lot of talented people that were in that room.
[17:35.600 --> 17:39.200]  But at the same time, it really is the work ethic and stuff that's going to continue that
[17:39.200 --> 17:39.680]  process.
[17:39.680 --> 17:41.760]  I feel like a lot of people, I see it.
[17:41.760 --> 17:46.560]  I feel like people personally also see it around like year three, year four, you know,
[17:46.560 --> 17:49.120]  there's this like wave of like, I know everything about it.
[17:49.120 --> 17:53.120]  And as long as you kind of keep your head down on that and you kind of run, run through
[17:53.120 --> 17:57.200]  it, I feel like that's where you come out on the other side and you're hungry on a whole
[17:57.200 --> 18:00.960]  another level to try to understand things because you really have taken the time to
[18:00.960 --> 18:04.160]  reflect and know that you don't know really shit about growing cannabis.
[18:04.160 --> 18:07.440]  You've just been really running what a lot of other people have been telling you and
[18:07.440 --> 18:09.120]  it's been working out hopefully for you.
[18:09.120 --> 18:13.840]  But at the same level to run a larger facility or something like that, it really does take
[18:13.840 --> 18:15.360]  experience as well as knowledge.
[18:15.360 --> 18:18.960]  So Sticky, I want to kind of give you the, you know, the mic for a second and just kind
[18:18.960 --> 18:23.840]  of talk about kind of more of the attributes and stuff, because it's amazing to me, man,
[18:23.840 --> 18:26.080]  how you are able to just kind of pick people out.
[18:26.080 --> 18:31.120]  Like you could you could be some kind of cannabis scout, you know, and you have a very
[18:31.120 --> 18:32.480]  unique skill set, my friend.
[18:33.360 --> 18:34.800]  Uh, well, can you hear me?
[18:36.400 --> 18:37.200]  Yeah, cool.
[18:37.200 --> 18:39.680]  I think I got my headset set up now, so we're good.
[18:41.280 --> 18:45.840]  Well, there's a few people that stood out at the cup the first year we had it in 2018.
[18:45.840 --> 18:52.160]  Obviously, the winner, Genome Alchemy with his 18 percent THC organic living soil.
[18:52.880 --> 18:57.200]  But Stoney Jacks, he just seemed like he had a thirst for knowledge.
[18:57.920 --> 19:00.000]  And we had a conversation after the cup.
[19:00.800 --> 19:02.640]  I can't remember who initiated it.
[19:02.640 --> 19:08.720]  I think I was calling him to see if they wanted to move up to Denver and like, you know, whatever,
[19:09.360 --> 19:11.600]  get a place, grow some weed, live.
[19:12.480 --> 19:17.040]  But then we started talking about how he could place higher in the cup or how he could get
[19:17.040 --> 19:18.160]  better weed, whatever.
[19:19.040 --> 19:22.560]  And I kind of told him that, you know, you got to go bigger pots.
[19:23.440 --> 19:24.160]  You got to do this.
[19:24.160 --> 19:24.800]  You got to do that.
[19:24.800 --> 19:28.480]  And that and that, I think kind of maybe locked it in for him.
[19:29.680 --> 19:31.200]  And he was going to start doing it then.
[19:31.200 --> 19:33.120]  So that was about three or four years ago.
[19:33.120 --> 19:37.200]  I think that's how old his no-till beds are now, about three and a half years.
[19:38.160 --> 19:38.720]  Exactly.
[19:42.080 --> 19:44.560]  And do you remember the genetics that he entered in?
[19:44.880 --> 19:45.680]  Man, I don't.
[19:45.680 --> 19:48.080]  I don't remember too many of the genetics.
[19:48.080 --> 19:49.520]  It was on my computer.
[19:49.520 --> 19:53.680]  I almost bet if we went to your homegrower's account, I bet it's still up there.
[19:53.680 --> 19:55.680]  Yeah, I forgot what I entered.
[19:55.680 --> 19:56.240]  Let me look.
[19:56.880 --> 19:58.160]  Yeah, let me look real quick.
[19:58.160 --> 20:02.080]  But yeah, he placed, I think, seventh place, if I remember correctly.
[20:02.080 --> 20:02.880]  Was that right, Duran?
[20:03.680 --> 20:06.080]  No, I think it was actually lower than that.
[20:06.080 --> 20:08.880]  So yeah, I don't remember.
[20:08.880 --> 20:09.360]  I don't remember.
[20:09.360 --> 20:11.520]  So I remember sending you the message.
[20:12.480 --> 20:15.280]  I was like, hey, what did I place in that cup?
[20:15.280 --> 20:17.360]  Because you never posted.
[20:19.280 --> 20:20.560]  You only did one through three.
[20:20.560 --> 20:21.520]  You didn't post the rest.
[20:21.520 --> 20:25.440]  And I'm curious, of course, because I want to know where I was at.
[20:26.240 --> 20:29.200]  And I think I was like 11, 14, something like that.
[20:29.200 --> 20:29.840]  Really low.
[20:31.280 --> 20:31.840]  Hurt my heart.
[20:34.080 --> 20:34.800]  To be fair.
[20:34.800 --> 20:36.080]  Yeah, you took it in stride, though.
[20:36.080 --> 20:36.720]  I mean, you got to.
[20:37.280 --> 20:40.080]  I think that's one of the reasons that, again, you kind of stood out
[20:40.640 --> 20:46.240]  back then is because, to be fair, some of those people did take it to heart and maybe
[20:46.800 --> 20:48.000]  lash out a little bit.
[20:48.000 --> 20:51.600]  And I felt like you had the totally opposite approach to everything on that.
[20:51.600 --> 20:53.280]  You were just like, how can I get better?
[20:53.280 --> 20:54.800]  Sticky, what can I do to improve?
[20:56.720 --> 21:01.520]  And then that's the real thing that I wanted to get across today is just a year or two years in,
[21:01.520 --> 21:04.880]  if you really put in the time and effort, there's a lot of things that could potentially
[21:04.880 --> 21:08.400]  change for you and your family and that kind of stuff, because you have that actual knowledge.
[21:08.400 --> 21:11.440]  Now you have that base system where you can explain things.
[21:11.440 --> 21:13.120]  You mentioned a working interview.
[21:13.120 --> 21:16.000]  I feel like a lot of people probably are moving towards that.
[21:16.000 --> 21:20.400]  I've never even heard of that until today, but it sounds like it's well thought out because
[21:20.400 --> 21:25.840]  how do you vet someone if you're going to put them in a big time position in your facility?
[21:25.840 --> 21:30.000]  How do you know that what they're telling you, they're going to be able to complete
[21:30.640 --> 21:33.600]  three months, six months, nine months as things start to really dial in.
[21:34.160 --> 21:42.320]  So I feel like the playbook, if you will, the things that Sticky, like a scout, is looking for
[21:43.120 --> 21:44.960]  is more of the hunger aspect.
[21:44.960 --> 21:49.280]  So when a potential employer is looking at you, that's going to come across.
[21:49.280 --> 21:52.240]  And Duran, you're a prime example of that, man.
[21:52.240 --> 21:55.280]  There's just somebody that was just, hey, man, you entered this contest.
[21:57.040 --> 21:59.520]  It's kind of up to whatever the judges and everything in life,
[22:00.320 --> 22:01.920]  you placed at that certain position.
[22:01.920 --> 22:04.880]  And then a lot of people did take that a certain way.
[22:04.880 --> 22:10.800]  And then just to go the other road, man, I don't think there were too many from that point on that
[22:10.800 --> 22:11.840]  had any desire.
[22:12.720 --> 22:14.480]  A lot of them kind of fell off, to be honest.
[22:14.480 --> 22:16.240]  I don't really even see them on Instagram and stuff.
[22:16.240 --> 22:21.280]  So just putting in the work, the experience, that's going to trump a lot of the other
[22:21.920 --> 22:26.720]  attributes that maybe somebody has up on you because there is a lot of laziness in the industry
[22:26.720 --> 22:27.220]  as well.
[22:28.180 --> 22:30.100]  Yeah, I really appreciate that.
[22:30.100 --> 22:36.260]  And yeah, the showing your employer thing is a good point you've picked.
[22:36.260 --> 22:39.700]  And that's kind of the reason why I enter in these cups,
[22:39.700 --> 22:42.900]  is because I know I don't have an education.
[22:42.900 --> 22:43.940]  You know, I don't have a degree.
[22:44.500 --> 22:45.220]  Can't afford that.
[22:46.660 --> 22:52.820]  But I do have trophies that show that I have been part of this community
[22:52.820 --> 22:56.260]  and have done well in this community instead of just saying,
[22:56.340 --> 22:59.220]  I got a piece of paper and I should know how to grow.
[22:59.220 --> 23:04.500]  You know, that's been my whole thing is like, this has been a resume builder to me.
[23:04.500 --> 23:07.620]  I don't have anything else really here in Colorado.
[23:07.620 --> 23:10.180]  I've made great friends and stuff like that.
[23:10.180 --> 23:16.260]  But I came here to Colorado with a purpose and that was to learn this industry in hopes to
[23:17.940 --> 23:20.500]  help myself, you know, monetarily.
[23:20.500 --> 23:23.460]  But I also want to grow the absolute best I can.
[23:24.100 --> 23:29.780]  And where this industry is going commercially is not quality.
[23:29.780 --> 23:31.060]  It's more commodity.
[23:32.500 --> 23:35.220]  So I want to be different.
[23:35.220 --> 23:36.900]  I don't want to be just a commodity.
[23:36.900 --> 23:41.140]  I want to be known for what I pulled down in the garden
[23:41.140 --> 23:45.460]  instead of what my box looks like or bag looks like, you know, like
[23:46.980 --> 23:49.780]  my product actually helps people instead of looks cool.
[23:50.420 --> 23:57.460]  And that's what I use these competitions is my resume builder.
[23:57.460 --> 24:01.300]  So if I can enter in as many competitions as I can show that I do good,
[24:01.940 --> 24:10.260]  I think that shows that I have the skill over someone that just has word of mouth, you know?
[24:12.980 --> 24:16.980]  Yeah, I think people on the outside, especially if they are more of like a suit
[24:17.540 --> 24:22.900]  type individual within that operation, bringing on hardware that people have heard about,
[24:23.700 --> 24:28.580]  you know, is just something that I know people feel one way about it and other people,
[24:28.580 --> 24:34.420]  you know, but like to get to your point basically is how do you how are you going to show yourself
[24:35.380 --> 24:39.540]  that you're on the next level or you continue to improve without entering these kind of things?
[24:39.540 --> 24:44.100]  And to win back and back or to place back to back really shows that you're on or you're
[24:44.100 --> 24:49.220]  beginning on your journey to become an elite farmer. And that's why I always like to use
[24:49.220 --> 24:55.300]  that NFL analogies, because it is brutal. Like if let's say you got Russet mites and the suits
[24:55.300 --> 25:01.140]  don't really understand that on a level, you know, you basically get cut, right? Somebody else comes
[25:01.140 --> 25:07.220]  in. It might be might be a year or two before somebody picks you up again. So that aspect of
[25:07.220 --> 25:12.020]  it is extremely brutal. And I don't think enough people know that on the commercial side of things
[25:12.020 --> 25:16.420]  that you might get this one shot. And if you don't feel like you have the skill set to be able
[25:16.420 --> 25:25.620]  to pull this off, it's going to get exposed really quickly. Yeah, yeah, for sure. And in another thing
[25:25.620 --> 25:32.020]  in the commercial aspect is there's such a big disconnect between the suits and the people on
[25:32.020 --> 25:38.420]  the ground, the people that know what is going. So that's been a hard one to that's been a hard
[25:38.420 --> 25:44.900]  hurdle in this whole commercial growing aspect is getting the point across to someone that doesn't
[25:44.900 --> 25:52.420]  know growing doesn't care about growing, because you can't quantify quality into a number for their
[25:52.420 --> 26:00.660]  equations is the easiest way to put it, you know, that that sucks. But hopefully, as the industry
[26:00.660 --> 26:06.980]  matures, and the education gets out there, we'll see a flip in in that.
[26:10.810 --> 26:16.010]  So it's taking what do you mind kind of sharing or what else? I mean, I know you guys talked for
[26:16.010 --> 26:21.210]  a little bit on that. Was there anything deeper on that kind of advice? Because I, I hope that
[26:21.210 --> 26:25.050]  people watching today see this and they're like, hi, in a year, I probably really could achieve
[26:25.050 --> 26:29.050]  something here, especially with the amount of volume, all the podcasts you had mentioned. I
[26:29.050 --> 26:35.210]  mean, there's just a solid base for somebody, even if they started like literally right now,
[26:35.210 --> 26:41.530]  within a year to be ahead of a lot of other individuals that have a certain viewpoint in life.
[26:43.770 --> 26:48.490]  Yeah, I mean, I think we talked about the basics of no till living soil, basically,
[26:48.490 --> 26:54.010]  just to get him kind of get his interest peaked in that and get him researching the rhizosphere
[26:54.890 --> 27:00.170]  and getting the worms process in the amendments that you lay down with a cover crop being benefit
[27:01.290 --> 27:07.450]  or that being the benefit of the cover crop. And then I think we talked about water usage
[27:07.450 --> 27:13.770]  a little bit how you don't use as much water as often. It's a little bit more lax on the
[27:13.770 --> 27:18.730]  water schedule. So it actually seems like a lot of work, but it's a little bit more hands off
[27:18.730 --> 27:26.930]  once you get it rolling. And do you want to kind of jump in? Because I feel like when you
[27:26.930 --> 27:31.730]  were talking about the horizontal system, we were even explaining that yesterday to the soil doctor.
[27:32.370 --> 27:38.290]  And I feel like maybe some of that, you know, some of the more data driven individuals
[27:38.290 --> 27:44.930]  maybe seemed like he really didn't understand fully how your system worked. So I wanted to
[27:44.930 --> 27:49.330]  kind of give you another chance to kind of break down the horizontal system, because I got a lot of
[27:49.330 --> 27:56.770]  DMs about that yesterday. And then we can kind of jump back into Duran about basically, I feel
[27:56.770 --> 28:01.570]  like Sticky was telling you, all right, man, your cannabis is on point. How are you going to be able
[28:01.570 --> 28:06.770]  to win, you know, when it's the peers of, you know, all the peers in one room, and it's really
[28:06.770 --> 28:12.690]  taking your terpene profiles to the next level, really getting that, you know, your flower to
[28:12.690 --> 28:16.690]  hold those concepts. So Leighton, I want to kind of give you a second on that, because I feel like
[28:17.250 --> 28:22.930]  if people misunderstood how the horizontal system set up, you know, if you wanted to give us like a
[28:23.570 --> 28:27.090]  three minute pitch or whatever, again, I would really appreciate that, man.
[28:27.090 --> 28:34.290]  Yeah, sure. No problems. So bottom line is that it came about as a result of working with high end
[28:34.290 --> 28:41.010]  landscape architects on multi-million dollar projects, where these guys wanted to plant
[28:41.010 --> 28:46.850]  inappropriately. So planting inappropriately is like putting a swamp maple that likes its feet
[28:46.850 --> 28:52.530]  wet and then surrounding it by a hedgerow that likes its feet dry. How do you balance that soil
[28:52.530 --> 28:58.210]  so that both these plants will survive adjacent to each other, even though their requirements are
[28:58.210 --> 29:04.450]  vastly different. So I got introduced into the cannabis industry about five years ago, I looked
[29:04.450 --> 29:09.170]  at what they were doing with their super soils. And I was like, well, guys, this really doesn't
[29:09.170 --> 29:15.010]  make sense because your outside is going hydrophobic and your bottom is going anaerobic.
[29:15.010 --> 29:21.250]  So basically all the water sat down at the bottom in the middle of the pot and basically created an
[29:21.250 --> 29:26.610]  anaerobic environment, which basically caused more pest pressure, more fungal pressure.
[29:27.650 --> 29:33.490]  And you're just you're never going to get a true living soils in just organic matter. It's a low
[29:33.570 --> 29:39.490]  tension soil. So by low tension, I mean that it's very porous. It has a lot of air space
[29:40.930 --> 29:46.450]  and it soaks up water and holds it. So the whole reason for the horizontal soil system is basically
[29:46.450 --> 29:53.410]  biominicry. It's copying what nature does. So the bottom layer, the horizon is basically an
[29:53.410 --> 30:01.330]  alluvial layer or a sand filter. And that means that it will not allow organic matter to penetrate
[30:01.330 --> 30:07.010]  into it and then therefore go anaerobic. So you overwater your pot. No problem. It just
[30:07.010 --> 30:15.890]  sinks into the horizon and stays there until the demand, the surface of the pot starts to dry out
[30:15.890 --> 30:24.290]  and naturally creates a hydraulic pressure which pulls the water up. And basically the horizon is
[30:24.290 --> 30:30.930]  the is the key to that. So the horizon is a very high tension soil. It's got clay, a lot of clay
[30:30.930 --> 30:38.130]  and silt as well as some organic matter in it and therefore helps to regulate that pressure. So as
[30:38.130 --> 30:44.290]  the pressure builds on the surface of the pot, the horizon wicks the moisture out of the horizon
[30:44.290 --> 30:51.090]  and allows it to penetrate up into the horizon. Oh, standing for organic layer. So basically this
[30:51.090 --> 30:57.810]  is just copying what nature does naturally. This is how groundwater systems work, how plants do
[30:57.810 --> 31:03.090]  well when they get to excess rain all the time. The moisture is allowed to move through that
[31:03.090 --> 31:10.370]  overrides and down into the A and then out into the E. So it's really just a simple, basic understanding
[31:10.370 --> 31:18.530]  of the way soil works and functions in nature. So that's why I presented it to the cannabis
[31:18.530 --> 31:23.570]  industry. You know, like I said, four or five years ago, basically got laughed off the stage. But,
[31:23.570 --> 31:29.490]  you know, here we are four or five years later, I get hit up all the time and thanked for for giving
[31:29.490 --> 31:33.810]  them this, this knowledge, which is really nature's knowledge. It's not mine. I just, you know,
[31:33.810 --> 31:40.130]  basically copied what I saw. And it does functions extremely well. And I've got some people that have
[31:40.130 --> 31:45.410]  basically said, all I do is water it twice. I fill up the horizon and I walk away from my plants.
[31:45.410 --> 31:52.210]  And then as, as it really starts to dry out and I see that leaf, you know, not tracking the sun as
[31:52.210 --> 31:59.410]  much, I filled it back up again. And so there goes to show you just how easy the system works as far
[31:59.410 --> 32:04.370]  as watering. And I can't tell you how many situations I've seen of underwatering and
[32:04.370 --> 32:09.490]  overwatering. It has to be probably the most complex part of growing this plant. And when
[32:09.490 --> 32:15.410]  you're in a living soil system, if you don't have sand, silt and clay, how do you expect all of
[32:15.410 --> 32:21.090]  those diverse microbes and fungi to function when you're only giving them organic matter? They're
[32:21.090 --> 32:26.850]  not, they're basically going to insist or die off because the environment isn't perfect for them.
[32:27.490 --> 32:33.970]  So when you really push into looking at a completely living soil system, where you've got
[32:33.970 --> 32:42.290]  micro-orthopods, worms, fungi, bacteria, protozoa, you really need all of the ingredients that allow
[32:42.290 --> 32:47.730]  all of them to function in nature naturally. So that's, that's the bottom line on the horizontal
[32:47.730 --> 32:52.370]  soil system. But yeah, it works great for those who have not tried it.
[32:53.490 --> 32:59.410]  And again, shout out to Marco because he kind of wanted to prove that with his little terrarium.
[32:59.410 --> 33:04.930]  He set up a terrarium based off your suggestions. So basically like a little microcosm system.
[33:04.930 --> 33:11.650]  So you can see on your shelf if you want to check that out. It's, I think, just a couple
[33:11.650 --> 33:17.330]  weeks ago. So that's just another way if you guys want to kind of see for yourself if Leighton,
[33:17.410 --> 33:21.570]  you know, what's Leighton talking about here? How am I going to be able to see this without,
[33:22.370 --> 33:25.970]  because to be fair Leighton, right? So many people, especially at this time of year,
[33:25.970 --> 33:30.210]  there's no way they're going to change anything. They got to get through Christmas and then New
[33:30.210 --> 33:34.690]  Year and all that kind of stuff. But I also feel like this is the time where the majority of the
[33:34.690 --> 33:40.450]  industry, the ones that I feel like are motivated, this is where they have time to educate themselves.
[33:40.450 --> 33:43.730]  They have a little money in their pocket and they're able to sit down and kind of start to
[33:43.730 --> 33:48.690]  plan things out. And I hope that newer viewers are in that same boat right now, where there's a
[33:48.690 --> 33:54.610]  lot of things that you could plan out for 2022 and kind of, you know, potential things come to
[33:54.610 --> 34:00.610]  fruition. I'm sure when Stoney Jaxx was starting to put his plan together, there's a lot of times
[34:00.610 --> 34:04.530]  where you have a lot of self doubt with that kind of stuff. I know we all kind of deal with that.
[34:05.090 --> 34:10.610]  But again, as we continue to progress, the real focus is that mother nature is
[34:10.610 --> 34:17.890]  really guiding this whole thing. So when you're able to remove that ego and just kind of continue
[34:17.890 --> 34:23.170]  forward with the education, I feel that's why you continue to bring home the hardware, man. And I
[34:23.170 --> 34:29.410]  like the grow off thing because you can throw up the wrestling, the belt, which is a pretty cool
[34:29.410 --> 34:36.370]  little piece of hardware for a trophy. Yeah, I really like the belt. Hopefully I get two more
[34:36.370 --> 34:43.810]  this year with the competition after I turn in. But yeah, to go back to Sticky Lungs
[34:44.450 --> 34:51.730]  helping me go organic. Yeah, he told me that I needed to grow in bigger pots. And I was growing
[34:51.730 --> 34:58.050]  in five gallon pots, I think at that time. And he's like, Oh, you got to go at least 20. And
[34:58.770 --> 35:06.770]  and I was like, Alright, I'll try that. So I wanted to do it all myself this time, because I'd
[35:06.770 --> 35:11.570]  learned so much and heard so many people mixing their own soil. So I found a recipe to follow.
[35:11.570 --> 35:20.930]  And it was the sub cool recipe is living soul recipe, or super soul recipe. And I mixed it up
[35:20.930 --> 35:29.650]  myself and I followed it, let it let it cook for two, two weeks. And I filled up my real quick,
[35:29.650 --> 35:33.890]  I want to I want to let you kind of define cook because that that confused a lot of people on the
[35:33.890 --> 35:37.970]  forums even back in the day before it was explained. So I want to make sure that newer
[35:37.970 --> 35:45.170]  viewers understand what that means. Yeah, so the the cooking of the soil is, from what I learned
[35:46.050 --> 35:51.890]  is the microbe activity activity happening, everything is starting to, to come together.
[35:53.250 --> 35:59.250]  The dry amendments are starting to break down, which can put off heat, I think, especially with
[35:59.250 --> 36:10.850]  alpha alpha. So doing the two week cook allows all the microbes to mix together and then settle
[36:11.490 --> 36:19.010]  and to where it's not going to be really hot on the plant that gets put into the soil. Because
[36:19.010 --> 36:23.890]  if you mix and then put a plant directly in there could be hot pockets of different nutrients.
[36:25.090 --> 36:29.650]  So basically, what he's talking about is the thermophilic process where certain types of
[36:29.650 --> 36:35.730]  microbes that thermal fights are doing their work and breaking down carbon and breaking our nutrients
[36:36.450 --> 36:40.290]  and then making a plant available. But yeah, if you don't cook it, you're going to cook your plant.
[36:41.730 --> 36:48.530]  So that's that's the point of letting that happen till the till the soil then goes back to what
[36:48.530 --> 36:53.250]  we call a, you know, basically ambient temperature and then then you know,
[36:53.250 --> 36:56.290]  it's ready to plant. So I thought I'd just throw that in there.
[36:58.050 --> 37:05.730]  Yep. And then after I did the cooking, I filled my first two. I think I think I did 20 gallon pots.
[37:06.530 --> 37:14.450]  First, those are those are my first two super soil organic pots. And then I I've been using
[37:14.450 --> 37:22.450]  build a soil. So I had their cover crop mix their 12 seed mix, but I also just went to the garden
[37:22.450 --> 37:30.610]  supply store and got my own like red clover bowl, white clover bowl, different types of legumes,
[37:30.610 --> 37:37.410]  just because of what I read about the nitrogen fixation. I just wanted to mix in as many
[37:38.130 --> 37:43.730]  plants as possible because at that time I learned or I thought I learned that the more diversity,
[37:43.730 --> 37:51.090]  the better. So that's kind of what I did. And I I planted my first cover crop. And
[37:52.690 --> 37:55.010]  now I'm rocking full organics now.
[37:55.570 --> 38:01.490]  Nice, nice. And, you know, I just have to bounce this off. I've been seeing a lot of this
[38:01.490 --> 38:07.890]  discussion on perched soil systems. Basically, that is a situation that occurs in nature,
[38:07.890 --> 38:12.850]  but it's not it doesn't occur in a horizontal soil system. You really have to do the readings.
[38:12.850 --> 38:17.490]  You're basically looking at trying to compare an apple to an orange. So I just wanted to throw
[38:17.490 --> 38:21.410]  that out there in the chat because I've seen this come up a number of times in the past. But
[38:21.490 --> 38:26.930]  yeah. So when you when you first planted your you're in your super soil, what was your blend
[38:26.930 --> 38:31.330]  of ratio of the nutrients, the raw organic aminos that you put into it?
[38:32.770 --> 38:39.890]  Oh, man, it's it's honestly been so long and my memory is not the greatest. I did try following
[38:39.890 --> 38:47.250]  sub cools recipe as close as possible because that was I mean, that was my first time planting
[38:47.650 --> 38:54.770]  because that was I mean, that was my guideline at that moment. So I went and tried to find
[38:55.730 --> 39:01.170]  every every raw ingredient that he enlisted in his recipe and just try following that. Honestly,
[39:01.170 --> 39:05.730]  I didn't do any tweaking or anything like that myself.
[39:07.170 --> 39:10.850]  And you're still running that same system now, three, three years later.
[39:11.490 --> 39:19.090]  Yeah, so I actually do have those two pots still running in. I have six no till pots total at home
[39:19.650 --> 39:26.290]  in rotation, two of them, which I don't know which one are are my two original that I built
[39:26.290 --> 39:36.450]  with sub cool super soil recipe, but the other four I used the build a soil mix version three,
[39:37.010 --> 39:38.210]  version two and version three.
[39:39.090 --> 39:43.090]  Nice, nice. And have you been amending them at all or just letting them go?
[39:43.890 --> 39:49.090]  Yeah, so I do amend I have the the cover crops growing cover crop and companion plants growing.
[39:49.090 --> 39:56.610]  So as they grow tall and unruly, I cut those back. I also I top dress with
[39:57.810 --> 40:05.570]  a craft blend about every two weeks. That's from build a soil also. Sometimes I'll do
[40:05.650 --> 40:14.370]  Bokashi about every week or three. I don't really have a set schedule to anything. And that's kind
[40:14.370 --> 40:20.850]  of the reason why I've liked or been drawn to organics because it's it's not like if you do
[40:20.850 --> 40:25.570]  don't do this, then it's going to die. I mean, there's there's there's some cushion there.
[40:27.410 --> 40:31.490]  That really is kind of the bigger learning curve for people that are transitioning. They're like,
[40:31.490 --> 40:36.130]  all right, so what do I do the first few weeks? You know, what do I do? It's almost their brain is
[40:36.130 --> 40:40.850]  still thinking week one, week two, week three, when the reality is, especially when you're
[40:40.850 --> 40:45.810]  managing these systems and everything starts to come alive is just to kind of make sure that
[40:45.810 --> 40:51.490]  things are improving week by week, month by month. That's why a lot of the bigger names in the living
[40:51.490 --> 40:58.370]  soil system. I think we started to show a lot of them won't show you their entire grow. But a lot
[40:58.370 --> 41:03.810]  of the living soil guys are happy and girls are happy to show you their living soil systems for
[41:03.810 --> 41:08.370]  the most part, because there's not really deficiencies that you see there once things
[41:08.370 --> 41:12.130]  have kind of taken hold. And there really is something to be said about that when you're able
[41:12.130 --> 41:19.330]  to continue the processing and have perpetual harvest that are successful. IPM protocols are
[41:19.330 --> 41:24.370]  on point so that you protect that cannabis and things continue to improve. There's not even
[41:24.370 --> 41:28.690]  really too many brands out there that are willing to kind of show behind the curtain.
[41:28.690 --> 41:33.490]  You know, the the the Oz, if you will, doesn't really want that when anybody know what's going
[41:33.490 --> 41:38.450]  on back there. And even some of the bigger brands here that I feel like people respect. There's
[41:38.450 --> 41:44.610]  still I feel like every company has secrets, but if it's organic and it's it's hopefully on the
[41:44.610 --> 41:53.730]  right point towards medicine. Yeah, man, you hit that. You hit that on the head about the big
[41:53.730 --> 42:00.050]  companies not wanting to show anything because they know their stuff don't look right. But that's
[42:00.050 --> 42:03.810]  a big one in the industry. And that's that's that's a big part of the disappointment I talked
[42:03.810 --> 42:09.010]  about earlier. Like, I came out here in this industry supposed to be the cleanest, best flower
[42:09.010 --> 42:15.410]  ever. But yeah, there's a lot of secrets. And to me, this industry doesn't have many secrets if you
[42:15.410 --> 42:23.330]  know how to grow or know the process. There aren't many proprietary things, I don't think.
[42:24.290 --> 42:30.770]  Unless genetics be one. Yeah, I'll let all the commercial companies in Colorado in on a hint.
[42:31.650 --> 42:36.130]  Dry your weed for longer than five days. Boom. There you go.
[42:37.890 --> 42:44.210]  Bam. That's how you don't get Colorado crispy right there. I just improved 70 80% of the
[42:44.210 --> 42:49.170]  companies out there. If they're listening to this, thank me later, or I'll send you my Venmo number
[42:49.170 --> 42:55.970]  or whatever. I love it. Well, something else that I feel like is an industry secret here in
[42:55.970 --> 43:01.730]  Colorado is they're in bags, right? Now, sometimes they'll even do it right in front of the customer,
[43:01.730 --> 43:06.530]  and then they'll jump, they'll drop it in the jar for you, you know, and then they put it out there.
[43:07.410 --> 43:11.010]  To me, it's just so disrespectful, especially when they do that right in front of you
[43:11.010 --> 43:15.890]  to represent the cannabis in a certain way. And then behind the shelf, or behind the scenes,
[43:16.530 --> 43:23.090]  when it's not on the shelf, it's almost basically a whole different program going on. And I personally
[43:23.090 --> 43:27.970]  saw that at a dispensary that I was at like a week and a half ago. The girl was just out there
[43:27.970 --> 43:34.770]  dumping all day. Well, dumping all the shake cannabis from the bag, basically like the old
[43:34.770 --> 43:39.250]  turkey bags that everybody used to use back. She was still using that kind of stuff, dumping it
[43:39.250 --> 43:43.890]  into the glass jars. And then they have marketing talking about how, you know, how they use their
[43:43.890 --> 43:49.410]  cannabis and all this kind of stuff and how it's top quality. But blatantly in your face,
[43:49.410 --> 43:54.290]  kind of, or I would imagine so most of the customers blatantly in your face about like,
[43:54.290 --> 44:02.690]  just doing the exact opposite. Yeah, I saw some shaking of the jars to smell this one.
[44:03.730 --> 44:10.050]  I was like, man, don't do that. Growers work really hard to keep that stuff immaculate and pristine
[44:10.690 --> 44:17.330]  and unsquished and unshaken and unrolled and unmolested. And then the bud tenders
[44:17.330 --> 44:22.210]  at the last second, shake the whole jar day in and day out. I'm just like, what's going on here?
[44:24.450 --> 44:31.170]  No respect. No respect. And there's a lot of people that I feel like that's why
[44:31.170 --> 44:35.650]  they also want to hide their cannabis. You know, like other dispensaries don't let anybody even
[44:35.650 --> 44:39.330]  kind of open a jar, crack a jar, smell it. One for the reasons you just brought up,
[44:39.330 --> 44:45.330]  or two, it's a lot easier to hide a lot of the growers mistakes when basically the customer can't
[44:45.330 --> 44:51.970]  see it until they're already out of the store. Pretty good business model. That's what I wish
[44:51.970 --> 45:00.610]  was more transparent, I guess, is like, nothing's perfect, you know? So like, if you can accept that
[45:00.610 --> 45:04.450]  and show people like we're all learning, the industry is still new, we're all learning.
[45:05.090 --> 45:10.450]  But I feel like everything has just become a secret and all the problems that people have
[45:12.130 --> 45:17.570]  get pushed aside because look, we have this brand new fucking whatever.
[45:19.410 --> 45:31.410]  It's just, I think the education between like bud tenders and the consumers on their end. And
[45:31.410 --> 45:37.250]  also, I feel like I wish more companies would show their growth. This is a big one. From working
[45:37.250 --> 45:43.250]  in the industry, I wish more people would show their growth. And if you're a grower, you should
[45:43.250 --> 45:50.290]  know that yeah, there's gonna be a problem here and there. But you shouldn't be scared to show
[45:50.290 --> 45:56.690]  off what you have if it's quality, supposedly. Yeah, it shouldn't be a rampant problem day in
[45:56.690 --> 46:02.690]  and day out for months upon months. You got mildew for over five, six months, you got mildew,
[46:02.690 --> 46:09.010]  buddy. You're not getting rid of it with that current regimen. And that is something I feel
[46:09.010 --> 46:15.650]  like, you know, so many companies kind of butt heads because if the head farmer isn't willing to
[46:16.290 --> 46:22.050]  be open to ideas when things aren't working, that's when all the friction starts because sometimes
[46:22.530 --> 46:29.330]  the assistant head grower kind of feels like they know how to fix the problem and they would love to
[46:29.330 --> 46:34.130]  be able to show that opportunity. But the head growers no way gonna let that again, like with
[46:34.130 --> 46:39.570]  the football analogy, because if you if they put you in coach, and you start throwing touchdowns,
[46:39.570 --> 46:44.210]  that dude's long gone. And that's something else that I feel like the consumer hurts on is
[46:44.850 --> 46:49.570]  there is still a lot of that kind of stuff going on. And especially a lot of the developing states,
[46:50.210 --> 46:56.370]  where they just hire a grower, the person sells them on a dream, basically, they're not able to
[46:56.370 --> 47:02.210]  produce like you mentioned, there's just powdery mildew. I saw that a lot in Oklahoma when things
[47:02.210 --> 47:06.930]  first started because there's the experience isn't there once things start to flower out
[47:06.930 --> 47:15.550]  to manage those systems at that level. Yeah, bootleg tech, like he said, it's like Duran said,
[47:15.550 --> 47:20.830]  it's a it's a new industry, but people have been growing weed for a long time. So I kind of have
[47:20.830 --> 47:27.630]  to not cut that many people that much slack. Man, I know some of this technology is new. LEDs,
[47:28.190 --> 47:34.190]  co2 systems are fairly new to people growing at home. I didn't have co2 back in Georgia.
[47:35.470 --> 47:42.910]  But you know, dehumidifiers, those are standard, standard things every grocer to
[47:42.910 --> 47:46.430]  account for. And if they're not sizable, then go ahead and expect some mold.
[47:46.990 --> 47:52.510]  Yeah, you know, and again, I think it really is goes back to education. And the only way to educate
[47:52.510 --> 47:58.270]  the consumers is to do stuff like this, where, you know, we're, we're openly talking about the
[47:58.270 --> 48:03.390]  difference between chem bud and bio bud, and there's a huge difference. You know, more,
[48:03.390 --> 48:09.150]  more and more people will get the experience like what Duran said is, you know, when I,
[48:09.150 --> 48:13.950]  I smoked this guy's weed, and I'm like, wow, that tastes great. And the high is really great. And
[48:14.110 --> 48:19.790]  the high is really great. And why can't I have that? Right? And that's that what that's what
[48:19.790 --> 48:24.030]  will drive the market in the future. But unfortunately, like you guys are talking
[48:24.030 --> 48:29.230]  about, there's so many secrets. And especially when you have someone who's all about the money
[48:29.230 --> 48:33.710]  and doesn't really give a shit about the plant. Of course, you're not going to grow good meat
[48:33.710 --> 48:39.230]  or more medicine. And I can't believe they are even allowed to call it medicine. You know,
[48:39.950 --> 48:44.990]  I'm on the verge of going on a rant about the medical industry as a whole, but I'll keep quiet.
[48:46.990 --> 48:51.070]  Well, Layton, what do you agree one way to, you know, as a consumer to combat this
[48:52.030 --> 48:59.710]  rampant? What do you say? Just bad weed in the industry is to buy from a smaller company?
[49:00.430 --> 49:06.110]  Yeah, well, look, look what happened in NorCal this year. Flo Cana fucked all of the organic
[49:06.110 --> 49:12.030]  farmers up there and refused to pay more than a few hundred dollars a pound, which is just
[49:12.030 --> 49:18.270]  fucking insane. And then you go to a dispensary down here and you smoke this mid shit. I mean,
[49:18.270 --> 49:23.230]  I won't go to the dispensaries anymore. I go there just to see what the fuck is going on and listen
[49:23.230 --> 49:28.350]  to the people talking. And then I encourage them to say, hey, you know, you ever heard of
[49:28.350 --> 49:32.510]  Gandhi air? You might want to look into it, man. I mean, you don't know what the fuck you're
[49:32.510 --> 49:37.310]  talking about. And you're and you're selling junk weed as if it's medicine. It isn't fucking
[49:37.310 --> 49:45.070]  chem. It's chem bud. So, no, I agree, dude. And unfortunately, the big disconnect is between
[49:45.070 --> 49:53.150]  money and the passion for the plant. And if there was an option to be able to sell at like,
[49:53.150 --> 50:00.190]  you know, farmers markets, then the industry would be wiped out. And I think that would be a really,
[50:00.190 --> 50:04.030]  really good thing, because everybody would realize, oh, my God, look at this week compared
[50:04.030 --> 50:08.670]  to the shit I buy at the dispensary for five times as much. Are you fucking kidding me?
[50:10.110 --> 50:16.350]  But the industry as a whole is run by money and politicians and lobbyists that don't allow
[50:17.310 --> 50:21.870]  the little guy to get a foot up because they want to make all the money themselves. So
[50:21.870 --> 50:25.790]  that's the real fight is, you know, the only way to do that is through education
[50:26.350 --> 50:33.870]  and encourage people to find out, seek out this this organic regenerative cannabis.
[50:33.870 --> 50:37.710]  And once they find it, they'll never go back. And when they do, they'll regret it.
[50:39.390 --> 50:44.350]  But that's going to take time. That kind of brings me up to my next question for you, Mr.
[50:44.350 --> 50:50.670]  Stoney Jaxx, is you obviously have an eye for genetics and breeding. Are there certain people
[50:50.670 --> 50:55.470]  that you feel like you'd like to give a tip of the hat to? Again, there's a lot of people that
[50:55.710 --> 51:00.590]  buying seeds right now, planting their things out. And unfortunately, a lot of people get burned
[51:00.590 --> 51:06.670]  when they first get into this, myself included. When I first got it, I thought probably foolishly
[51:06.670 --> 51:11.630]  that if you spend more money on the seeds from certain people, that those would be better
[51:11.630 --> 51:16.350]  genetics. And it's kind of like saying, like, I spent more money for this lottery ticket, so I had
[51:17.070 --> 51:23.390]  a better chance of winning. It just is the odds still are not really with you. So you really
[51:23.710 --> 51:28.110]  got to have the money to pheno hunt. And I know that you're, especially when you first started
[51:28.110 --> 51:33.630]  out, I was hoping to pick your brain on how you knew which genetics to run with a much smaller
[51:33.630 --> 51:40.990]  system compared to probably most of the competition when you entered in 2018. How do you kind of
[51:40.990 --> 51:45.470]  combat that? How do you make your attributes rise? And what genetics were you running?
[51:45.550 --> 51:54.590]  Oh, man. So like, with seeds, I definitely don't like the crazy expensive packs.
[51:56.190 --> 52:03.790]  I personally can't afford anything like that. I would like to see seeds more be easily,
[52:04.350 --> 52:11.230]  more easily available to everyone instead of making it a niche. I want to see everyone grow,
[52:11.230 --> 52:17.630]  I want to see everyone grow, honestly. But back then, the way I picked, I just popped a lot of
[52:17.630 --> 52:24.190]  seeds. Like when I first started growing up pretty much popped everything I had about 10 at a time.
[52:25.070 --> 52:33.310]  And when when I first started growing, I was more about just learning the the way the plant grows,
[52:34.030 --> 52:40.830]  was not doing too many adjustments to the plant or anything. I needed to see how this plant just
[52:41.390 --> 52:47.710]  does this thing regardless, it be a good girl or bad girl. But then also getting into the cannabis
[52:47.710 --> 52:53.790]  industry at the same time helped me see better strains that were already grown commercially. So
[52:55.070 --> 53:00.350]  being in a commercial grow, I could see like, at the time Blue Dream was hot, you know, like,
[53:00.350 --> 53:07.310]  I could see why Blue Dream is hot. It grew gigantic nugs. It's resistant, it, it threw down.
[53:07.870 --> 53:13.150]  So like, just seeing the commercial growing, I could bring that back to my home grow and,
[53:13.150 --> 53:18.990]  and see what I'm looking for. I am a little bit of buy it, I'm a bit biased on weed because I'm
[53:18.990 --> 53:23.790]  from the south. So like purple weed is very attractive to me. I don't know about you guys.
[53:24.430 --> 53:30.750]  But I like perp, you know, so a lot, I ordered a lot of perp strains. And that that was,
[53:30.910 --> 53:37.470]  um, that was a lot of my driving stuff was like, I always like to have a purple, purple genetic
[53:37.470 --> 53:44.190]  purple flower in in the grow because it, it just appealed to my eyes a lot. And it's always the
[53:44.190 --> 53:48.910]  first thing I'm drawn to. And it's kind of the mindset I had with entering in a couple of these
[53:48.910 --> 53:55.150]  cups was that mindset of just like, oh, perp, draws your eyes to it. I'm remember that, you know,
[53:56.110 --> 54:03.470]  um, that's kind of where I got on on seed. But now like, now the way I get seed, I like I like
[54:03.470 --> 54:12.350]  Jinxfruit a lot, because of his message, especially like he just seems like a real person, if that
[54:12.350 --> 54:19.150]  makes sense. You know, he's not like caught up in, in all this hype. Everything is turning into hype.
[54:19.150 --> 54:25.790]  And I personally don't want to see the industry go that way. I like the the community aspect. I
[54:25.790 --> 54:32.270]  don't. I like the giving and like, hey, smell this, try and grab some nugs. Like I like that,
[54:32.270 --> 54:37.950]  that community aspect. And I want to kind of keep that going instead of this commodity aspect
[54:37.950 --> 54:45.230]  coming through here. It's become almost like the guys that are really into like Supreme and stuff,
[54:45.230 --> 54:50.750]  you know, or it's like, we bought this half for $10. I'll sell it to you for three grand.
[54:53.150 --> 54:58.270]  People, people flip good weed and stuff. But at the end of the day, I do hope that more individuals
[54:58.270 --> 55:02.590]  want to actually see it as medicine, then more just, especially when you have a lot of money
[55:02.590 --> 55:06.670]  in your pocket. There should be more people that are reaching out trying to give back or at least
[55:06.670 --> 55:12.430]  let them sample something at some of those events. You know, some of the big names I've seen,
[55:12.430 --> 55:16.110]  like you had mentioned, Jinx Proof, you know, is be positive is what you were kind of talking
[55:16.110 --> 55:21.390]  about getting that the guys just seems very genuine from the heart, man. I believe if you're
[55:21.390 --> 55:26.990]  a veteran when he when he sees you and you say be positive, he'll give you a free seed. So I mean,
[55:26.990 --> 55:33.230]  that's just, you know, for the newer people into this, that's pretty rare for for a lot of breeders.
[55:33.230 --> 55:37.790]  And if you knew how many seeds they actually had, it's pretty comical why they wouldn't be able to
[55:37.790 --> 55:44.910]  do that. Yeah, the price tags on these packs, and if you ever pollen chunked yourself,
[55:45.470 --> 55:51.710]  and you see how many seeds you get back, it is in saying I'd rather just give people my seed,
[55:51.710 --> 55:56.270]  then I'd rather see everyone grow my strain that I gave him for free instead of making it
[55:56.270 --> 56:01.950]  a hot commodity. Like, I want to I do eventually want to have like some strain that's like Blue
[56:01.950 --> 56:06.270]  Dream next hype strain, but I'm not gonna be charging for it. I'm gonna be giving that away
[56:06.910 --> 56:13.400]  type thing. You can believe somebody will be charging for it after that, though.
[56:14.520 --> 56:25.800]  Yeah. That's the industry. But yeah, getting back to the shopping with smaller outfits, I think,
[56:26.600 --> 56:32.600]  I think that might be the way to go for the supporting just the quality of things,
[56:32.600 --> 56:36.280]  because usually the smaller outfits have more control over what they got going on.
[56:38.120 --> 56:44.440]  Just maybe asking how your cannabis is farmed. Yeah, transparency. Nobody asked that.
[56:45.000 --> 56:50.600]  No, transparency is huge. Dude, I every time I go into a dispensary, I ask that question. How
[56:50.600 --> 56:56.120]  is it grown? They can't answer you. They don't know. There's a big disconnect latent between
[56:56.120 --> 57:02.280]  the front of the house, the dispensaries in the back of the house, the cultivators. And yeah,
[57:02.280 --> 57:07.880]  I mean, huge. It's like it's like the offense doesn't know the defense. I mean, I know those
[57:07.880 --> 57:11.320]  are two different positions, but it's like they don't even know that. Hey, they come on the field
[57:11.320 --> 57:17.240]  after after we don't perform. There's just so much so much disconnection going on.
[57:19.400 --> 57:24.680]  And I don't it feels like with some companies in Colorado, it's just like, hey, man, that's how it
[57:24.680 --> 57:29.160]  is. You know, you come in here, you don't like the shit. Well, hey, we'll find somebody else to trim
[57:29.160 --> 57:33.000]  or, you know, it's pretty rare that they promote within. So there's not like you're
[57:33.560 --> 57:38.040]  you're drafting players that are going to be able to that want to work for your for your company for
[57:38.040 --> 57:42.840]  years on end. It creates a culture on the other side of things where I feel like a lot of people
[57:42.840 --> 57:47.880]  feel so disrespected that they will jump on different ships to be able to climb that ladder,
[57:47.880 --> 57:53.320]  because why would there be any loyalty? I see I see how you treat your managers when I'm a peon
[57:53.320 --> 57:58.680]  here trimming, you know, so I just feel like the skill sets, that's where this show really,
[57:58.680 --> 58:03.480]  you know, I feel like that's why I hope that people begin to resonate with a lot of this stuff
[58:03.480 --> 58:08.600]  is that this is, in my opinion, this is how you're going to be able to educate yourself is finding
[58:08.600 --> 58:12.840]  whatever podcast resonates with you and kind of rocking with that, trying these things out for
[58:12.840 --> 58:20.600]  yourself and building that skill set. And then when things eventually evolve where states basically
[58:20.600 --> 58:26.360]  federally legal, there's going to be a lot of opportunity. I mean, I guess I would be gambling
[58:26.360 --> 58:32.200]  on that, you know, but I would imagine that when things are federally legalized, you're still going
[58:32.200 --> 58:37.560]  to want craft cannabis at some level. And it doesn't really take much to be able to farm craft
[58:37.560 --> 58:42.360]  cannabis. If your goal is to just produce good medicine, you don't have dreams of owning yachts
[58:42.360 --> 58:48.040]  and shit like that. You can still provide a quality living not only for yourself, but your
[58:48.040 --> 58:52.280]  employees and actually create something that I feel like is beneficial to the market instead of
[58:52.280 --> 58:56.840]  just always taking from everybody. That's really how a lot of those owners are. They drive the
[58:56.840 --> 59:03.080]  fancy rides when the manager there's, you know, 60, 70 hours a week, whatever they're trying to
[59:03.080 --> 59:09.640]  push you on. And you're not able to enjoy life at all while they're basically living off the
[59:09.640 --> 59:16.200]  spoils of your work. I know that it's people feel jaded. I know, Thomas, I know this is just
[59:16.200 --> 59:20.520]  the industry as a whole, not saying just personally where you've seen, but I just feel like that in
[59:20.520 --> 59:28.680]  Colorado speaks for the majority of people that work at the larger brand dispensaries here in town.
[59:29.560 --> 59:35.720]  Yeah. And even third party, even third party producers.
[59:39.770 --> 59:44.330]  To really maybe harp on something else when the, when the trimmers come through,
[59:45.130 --> 59:50.490]  it seems like when you hire the teams a lot of those individuals just don't really give a shit.
[59:50.570 --> 59:56.010]  And it seems like a lot of the brands out there shoot themselves in the foot. When they hire,
[59:56.010 --> 01:00:00.090]  they go really cheap and just try to hire the teams that go around from, from place to place.
[01:00:00.730 --> 01:00:05.610]  You're usually going to have some kind of issue trying to save money. So again, I just don't
[01:00:05.610 --> 01:00:12.490]  understand when brands have that, that type of profit, why they wouldn't want a team to trim the
[01:00:12.490 --> 01:00:16.570]  weed to make sure that they had a lead on that. You know, if everybody's playing their role,
[01:00:16.570 --> 01:00:20.890]  that's what I mean. This becomes a well-oiled machine. And then you could probably get to a
[01:00:20.890 --> 01:00:26.250]  certain level where, you know, Hey, we're still making profits at I think a lot of the brands
[01:00:26.250 --> 01:00:31.290]  here still their profit margin is if they can get 800 a pound here in Colorado, which
[01:00:32.090 --> 01:00:36.890]  is extremely hard to compete with. That's why everybody's growing booth because it's still
[01:00:36.890 --> 01:00:43.850]  sells. So, so the market is $800 a pound in Colorado commercially.
[01:00:44.730 --> 01:00:51.690]  That's kind of high. Yeah. It's about that. 657, 750 pounds of a commercial that's commercial.
[01:00:52.330 --> 01:00:57.130]  Yeah. And that's commercial where like, if you put in the time and effort, a lot of the buyers,
[01:00:58.250 --> 01:01:02.490]  like these guys are kind of backing up. They don't have the knowledge to really know the
[01:01:02.490 --> 01:01:06.090]  difference. So to them, it's like, well, why would I give you more money for this?
[01:01:06.090 --> 01:01:09.930]  And then you, you know, you, as the farmer feel insulted, cause it's like, well, look at it.
[01:01:09.930 --> 01:01:13.130]  You can clearly see that there's some difference here, but, you know, smell it
[01:01:13.130 --> 01:01:16.810]  where all that's really mattered at the end of the day is how much they paid for.
[01:01:16.810 --> 01:01:26.410]  And if they can flip it, wait, wait, wait. Yeah. What the name is. Yeah. I know here in Colorado,
[01:01:26.410 --> 01:01:30.650]  when Charlie Sheen was going through his crazy shit, it was amazing how everybody all of a
[01:01:30.650 --> 01:01:36.090]  sudden had Charlie Sheen weed, you know, all the little like little pockets in town and stuff.
[01:01:36.090 --> 01:01:40.890]  Everybody had the Charlie Sheen. I just think that the industry kind of jumps on the bandwagons
[01:01:40.890 --> 01:01:46.090]  of that kind of stuff where it's just call it whatever. And it's certain people will.
[01:01:46.090 --> 01:01:49.930]  Oh man. Oh yeah. That's the tiger's blood.
[01:01:49.930 --> 01:01:55.210]  That's the big one. Yeah. They don't like, if people really treat this as medicine,
[01:01:55.210 --> 01:02:01.050]  you wouldn't be going around changing, changing names to strains just because it's not selling
[01:02:01.770 --> 01:02:08.330]  as blue dream, you know, but someone might get really get a lot of relief from blue dream,
[01:02:08.330 --> 01:02:13.290]  but now can never find it because the industry didn't change its name to like Maui sunset or
[01:02:13.290 --> 01:02:21.800]  something. Man, blue dream gets so much hate now. You talk about it in the post or something.
[01:02:26.200 --> 01:02:30.840]  I told you last time I was on the podcast, that's why we started the cups. Cause some guy told me
[01:02:30.840 --> 01:02:35.320]  his synthetic blue dream was better than my organic Scooby snacks. And I was like, all right,
[01:02:35.320 --> 01:02:37.320]  bring it down from the mountains. Let's see what it's about.
[01:02:39.240 --> 01:02:42.760]  But how about Scooby snacks stored away? Squirreled away.
[01:02:43.480 --> 01:02:48.280]  Yeah. My boy has in birds growing it. We got some other people growing it too,
[01:02:48.280 --> 01:02:54.520]  but he's holding onto it for about three years now. That's another dude. Yeah. That's another
[01:02:54.520 --> 01:02:59.000]  dude. I like from the cup, the first cup he sat by the booth, talked to my boy, Zach, who helped
[01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:03.560]  me with the cup the whole time. And then we became good friends and I've hung out with him a few
[01:03:03.560 --> 01:03:09.640]  times since then. Are you going to do the cup again this year or next year? I'd like to, I
[01:03:10.360 --> 01:03:14.840]  recently was introduced to, or a gentleman introduced himself to me. We're going to kind
[01:03:14.840 --> 01:03:20.120]  of collaborate on getting this thing back rolling. I believe with this platform and
[01:03:20.120 --> 01:03:27.400]  his help, we can get it going again. Our main thing is just finding, finding venues to host
[01:03:27.400 --> 01:03:31.960]  monthly meetings. So if we can find a venue, you know, say Southern Colorado,
[01:03:31.960 --> 01:03:39.160]  one in Central Colorado, one on the, on the front of the, I can't think of what they call it now.
[01:03:41.640 --> 01:03:46.440]  Just out in like Breckenridge or something like that. And one of the Fort Collins. Yeah. Front
[01:03:46.440 --> 01:03:51.800]  range. Sorry. But if we can find some venues, then yeah, we'll, we'll definitely get some
[01:03:51.800 --> 01:03:56.760]  things rolling where we can have monthly meetings. We can have, you know, people doing demos on how
[01:03:56.760 --> 01:04:02.920]  to make good bubble hash, how to whatever clone without giving your plants hop latent,
[01:04:04.200 --> 01:04:07.560]  whatever people are interested in. We'll find those people and we'll have them come
[01:04:09.080 --> 01:04:14.680]  do some presentations. But yeah, the cup, we're going to try to get the cup going too. Yeah,
[01:04:14.680 --> 01:04:20.120]  sorry. That's going to build up to the cup. So that's our, our main goal is to get the
[01:04:20.120 --> 01:04:26.120]  community more involved, not just have a cup just once a year, just for a party. That was cool, but
[01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:31.400]  I feel like with a little bit more involvement from the community, it could be a lot cooler.
[01:04:32.680 --> 01:04:38.440]  So that's, that's on me to get that rolling, you know? Well, there were, there used to be so many
[01:04:38.440 --> 01:04:46.760]  things on a monthly basis. And then you know, the Mecca got shut down with COVID cultivated sanity.
[01:04:46.760 --> 01:04:51.640]  And what other really places were there that didn't feel dirty and grimy, to be honest.
[01:04:52.600 --> 01:04:58.520]  You know, it's, it's really hard to have a quality event when certain aspects are where the location
[01:04:58.520 --> 01:05:02.920]  is just makes people feel uneasy. And I've definitely been to some cannabis events in
[01:05:02.920 --> 01:05:08.680]  Colorado where people felt uneasy. And definitely, I mean, we're just all hanging out, supposedly
[01:05:08.680 --> 01:05:12.040]  hanging out, having education. I don't want that where people feel like they have to come in with
[01:05:12.040 --> 01:05:16.680]  certain things and protect themselves. And like, we're all here just chilling, you know, you know,
[01:05:17.560 --> 01:05:23.160]  there's no reason for, for anything like that or to feel like that. So I think we reached out. I
[01:05:23.160 --> 01:05:27.720]  know Katie was talking to some individuals. If she's watching the show, maybe she could
[01:05:29.480 --> 01:05:34.280]  update me on that. The problem I feel like for the bigger, the cups and that kind of stuff,
[01:05:34.280 --> 01:05:39.320]  you would love to have 1500 people probably be there live. But here in Denver, that's probably
[01:05:39.320 --> 01:05:45.480]  going to, it's probably three grand just to open the door at a venue that allows you to consume
[01:05:46.440 --> 01:05:50.840]  on location. Yep. It's costly.
[01:05:50.840 --> 01:05:54.760]  You could do like a fundraiser, sticky, sticky lungs fundraiser.
[01:05:54.760 --> 01:05:57.640]  Go find me one of the 2000 people have signed.
[01:05:57.640 --> 01:06:00.200]  I'm sure someone in the community has like a privately owned
[01:06:01.160 --> 01:06:03.480]  warehouse or something we could find.
[01:06:04.600 --> 01:06:09.800]  So we, we reached out through this. We have talked to a few other people like that, but nobody,
[01:06:09.800 --> 01:06:13.880]  and I totally get that. Nobody wants to have a hundred people come to their spot though.
[01:06:14.520 --> 01:06:19.400]  And that's kind of what was cool about sticky's event is there were so many people there. So it
[01:06:19.400 --> 01:06:25.560]  really had that vibe of like, man, this is, this could be, I feel especially in 2018 sticky, this,
[01:06:25.560 --> 01:06:30.520]  that, I felt like, man, you, you started something here. You know, I think a lot of people were fed
[01:06:30.520 --> 01:06:39.800]  up with some of the other so-called award events where clearly it wasn't, it wasn't, it felt so
[01:06:39.800 --> 01:06:43.560]  biased that it was really hard to accept sometimes when you would see that kind of stuff where
[01:06:44.280 --> 01:06:49.800]  with your events, man, people just smoked the weed, graded the weed, looked at the weed,
[01:06:49.800 --> 01:06:53.560]  everybody added up the points and then boom, you got a winner. I mean, I don't know how else,
[01:06:54.920 --> 01:06:57.640]  that's about as fair as it gets to me as far as I understand.
[01:06:58.280 --> 01:07:03.800]  Yeah. The first year was a little bit harder to compute manually. The second year we had a
[01:07:03.800 --> 01:07:09.160]  spreadsheet, everybody filled out. So it was, you know, it was done. We knew who the winners were
[01:07:09.160 --> 01:07:14.920]  before the day of, we didn't have to process them that day. So we kind of got the swing of things.
[01:07:14.920 --> 01:07:18.360]  Nobody had ever thrown a cup that was helping me. So we didn't know what we were doing.
[01:07:19.400 --> 01:07:23.880]  No, that's what I mean. It was done really well, especially for cannabis events. Like it's really
[01:07:23.880 --> 01:07:28.600]  hard to get people to put in the time and effort to throw an event at that level. I mean, to have
[01:07:28.600 --> 01:07:34.440]  a hundred people show up legally and smoke cannabis and all that, it's extremely hard to do, even in
[01:07:34.440 --> 01:07:39.720]  Denver. You have to have security, you have to pay for, everybody has to pre-register. There's
[01:07:39.720 --> 01:07:43.640]  just so many other things. Otherwise you get yourself in trouble. You can get sued.
[01:07:45.320 --> 01:07:48.680]  It's true. And I'm not an event guy, so I learned a lot, but-
[01:07:49.960 --> 01:07:53.240]  Yeah. I learned about insurance. You got to make sure you pay for that insurance.
[01:07:54.280 --> 01:07:57.160]  Yeah. Somebody gets hurt, man. That's on you.
[01:07:57.640 --> 01:08:04.040]  All right. So let's get more into your growing methodology, Stoney Jacks. You had mentioned,
[01:08:04.040 --> 01:08:09.240]  basically, a guy that I admire, Harley Smith. I think he's heavily involved in that raw brand,
[01:08:10.120 --> 01:08:15.000]  MPK Industries, I think is the parent company of that. But he was one of the first guys,
[01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:18.280]  I hope that people Google that, check that dude out. He was one of the first guys I felt like
[01:08:18.280 --> 01:08:23.000]  where he was, again, breaking down things for the layman, for people that were maybe
[01:08:23.640 --> 01:08:29.080]  schooled in Georgia at the public schools. There's a lot of verbiage sometimes where I had to find
[01:08:29.080 --> 01:08:32.840]  out what that word even meant. Where Harley takes the time, it's nice. He's got his little lab
[01:08:32.840 --> 01:08:37.640]  jacket on. He has his presentation and he's talking about, the best one I feel like is the
[01:08:37.640 --> 01:08:42.360]  soil microbe video that he has. So check that stuff out. But when you're using his products,
[01:08:42.360 --> 01:08:48.040]  I felt like I used his products as well for a little bit there until you always are moving
[01:08:48.760 --> 01:08:55.480]  and learning. But there was something special about even maybe moving away from the,
[01:08:55.480 --> 01:08:59.400]  all right, I got three bottles here. Or like you had mentioned, advanced nutrients.
[01:08:59.400 --> 01:09:02.360]  You already got 32 bottles probably. Yeah, about 50 of them.
[01:09:02.360 --> 01:09:06.120]  Right. Well, they at least broke it down. It's like, all right, if you need this nutrient,
[01:09:06.120 --> 01:09:11.880]  here you go. If you need this nutrient, here you go. So I wanted to let people check that
[01:09:11.880 --> 01:09:15.240]  out for themselves. And then maybe you could explain that background. Because I know you
[01:09:16.040 --> 01:09:18.280]  have products over here, but you don't necessarily have to use them.
[01:09:18.280 --> 01:09:22.440]  Yeah. Well, I think you misunderstood me a little bit. It was actually my friend that
[01:09:23.160 --> 01:09:29.800]  started using the raw, that raw MPK line for his flower. I actually, yeah, I use,
[01:09:31.400 --> 01:09:37.000]  because I, at home, I'm not a big fan of the raw MPK line. I'm not a big fan of the
[01:09:37.960 --> 01:09:46.920]  his flower. I actually, yeah, I use, because I, at home, I would like to be more K&F
[01:09:48.120 --> 01:09:53.320]  related, but with time that I don't have, because I'm here at the commercial grow and I have a
[01:09:53.320 --> 01:10:00.040]  little family now, I've been using Build-A-Soul products. I'm pretty sure everyone's heard about
[01:10:00.040 --> 01:10:06.600]  Build-A-Soul. I really like what Jeremy's doing there with getting, again, the cannabis community
[01:10:06.600 --> 01:10:13.240]  aspect. I like that with Build-A-Soul, getting small farmers to put their inputs all on one side
[01:10:14.760 --> 01:10:18.360]  and all the education that he's putting out there. But I use,
[01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:24.760]  Kraft Blend is my main top dressing that I use now for my no-till pots.
[01:10:27.610 --> 01:10:32.330]  I feel like one of the main ingredients in that is more like the chitin, like the crab meal and
[01:10:32.330 --> 01:10:38.090]  stuff. And then I believe it has a little bit of certain trace minerals, that kind of stuff.
[01:10:38.650 --> 01:10:45.930]  So you're adding more of the creme de la creme of things that can improve Mother Nature.
[01:10:46.730 --> 01:10:53.610]  Yep. I think it's everything that they offer on their website, but not in a balanced
[01:10:53.930 --> 01:11:00.090]  nutrition, or balanced ratio. I kind of use it as just, I know that there's going to be food in
[01:11:00.090 --> 01:11:07.130]  there for the microbes and stuff like that. I've learned as I've been growing organically that
[01:11:07.130 --> 01:11:12.970]  it's not about feeding the plant. Like nothing that I'm doing is necessarily directed towards
[01:11:12.970 --> 01:11:19.530]  the plant. It's more about my soil and keeping the soil happy so the plant can take as needed.
[01:11:19.610 --> 01:11:23.530]  And that's the mindset that I've been doing, just making sure I have a mulch layer.
[01:11:24.490 --> 01:11:30.490]  I got my cover crop that I constantly cut back. And I top dress with Kraft Blend every so often,
[01:11:30.490 --> 01:11:36.490]  Bokashi. And I'm also using this round in particular with the grow-off competition,
[01:11:36.490 --> 01:11:39.450]  I use the fermented plant extracts from Miles.
[01:11:41.210 --> 01:11:48.000]  Yeah, that's another guy in the community that I feel like he's got his marketing down and
[01:11:48.080 --> 01:11:51.760]  he's providing quality products that people are continuing to say are helping them
[01:11:52.880 --> 01:11:56.640]  improve their growth. So shout out to Miles, cool ass dude.
[01:11:58.400 --> 01:12:04.000]  So I know you mentioned Jinx Proof. I feel like a lot of people always try to get me to pull the
[01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:08.960]  genetics out of the people that we interview. So I'm going to attempt again to try to maybe get a
[01:12:08.960 --> 01:12:14.320]  few more breeders that you feel like, if someone's newer to this, that they can actually get a
[01:12:14.480 --> 01:12:19.760]  take the plant basically from seed to harvest without the potential of things harming out on
[01:12:19.760 --> 01:12:24.000]  them. That was one of the bigger things that when I first got into this, I felt like
[01:12:24.960 --> 01:12:30.400]  slided in a way because I didn't realize that just because it's spending a lot of money,
[01:12:30.400 --> 01:12:37.360]  that doesn't necessarily mean that this plant can basically go haywire. And that's probably on me,
[01:12:37.360 --> 01:12:41.680]  not educating myself and really understanding the difference between a plant and a seed.
[01:12:41.680 --> 01:12:46.160]  Not educating myself and really understanding the difference between regular and feminized seeds.
[01:12:46.960 --> 01:12:52.640]  And the fact that just because I did hunt that out, found some females, doesn't necessarily mean
[01:12:52.640 --> 01:12:57.520]  that that female is going to ride all the way through. And environment, obviously, all those
[01:12:57.520 --> 01:13:02.080]  things take place. So what are some of the more of the genetics that you feel like the beginner
[01:13:02.080 --> 01:13:08.960]  could run with, be successful with a couple of flips and continue to educate themselves and improve?
[01:13:09.360 --> 01:13:15.840]  As a beginner, beginner, if you have like, access to clones, I think clean, good clones,
[01:13:15.840 --> 01:13:21.440]  that'd be a good first start without having the confusion of pop and seed. So at least you could
[01:13:21.440 --> 01:13:30.080]  see the growth structure of a plant. Seed wise, you really want me to name some breeders. I haven't
[01:13:30.080 --> 01:13:37.120]  really had any infatuations with any breeders. There hasn't been like a sole breeder that I'm
[01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:44.400]  like, Oh, everything from there is is far. It's more about I try to grow everything and just see
[01:13:44.400 --> 01:13:49.840]  what I like in my personal opinion, because everyone is looking for something different in
[01:13:49.840 --> 01:13:55.760]  their end flower. I personally don't like orange turps. You know, someone loves orange turps.
[01:13:55.760 --> 01:14:01.440]  I think it's more about what's your personal end goal or end product you're looking for.
[01:14:02.160 --> 01:14:12.960]  In my grow at this moment, I do have Relentless Genetics, Rose F2 seedlings going. I've got some
[01:14:14.640 --> 01:14:26.160]  Dominion Seed Co. local skunk. I've got a couple CSI Freak Show seedlings. And I've got Rainbow
[01:14:26.160 --> 01:14:35.840]  Belts from Archive going. Rainbow Belts F2 or Virgin 2. I feel like people specifically asked
[01:14:35.840 --> 01:14:40.480]  me this week to ask you those things because you keep raising those belts above your brother. So
[01:14:40.480 --> 01:14:46.160]  I mean, if you know, you're obviously doing something. I think it's more about to grow
[01:14:46.160 --> 01:14:52.240]  stuff. See that? Like genetics is one thing. I really think it's to grow. And that's, that's
[01:14:52.240 --> 01:14:55.920]  just pulling out those those full expressions. I mean, we say that. Yeah,
[01:14:55.920 --> 01:15:01.440]  yeah. That really is. It's that easy. But at the same time, right? How is that achieved? That's
[01:15:01.440 --> 01:15:07.200]  the really the hard part. All right. So what I've seen in the industry is everyone does not have
[01:15:07.200 --> 01:15:14.320]  patience. So I guess the secret of mine would be that I let the plants go to full, full flower.
[01:15:14.320 --> 01:15:22.080]  Like I let them get, get to the end. I see all these commercial grows cutting down at day 45.
[01:15:22.080 --> 01:15:28.160]  And 50 just so they can squeeze in two or three more harvest, you know. So they're not get to me
[01:15:29.040 --> 01:15:36.960]  in my mindset. There's no other like crop that gets pulled down early. Just to sell it, you know,
[01:15:36.960 --> 01:15:45.520]  so I think of the buying ripen turps, I guess, mindset of like, I want to grow this plant all
[01:15:45.520 --> 01:15:51.440]  the way until it shows me it's finished with the calyx is swelling. It's done swelling,
[01:15:51.440 --> 01:15:58.800]  bringing in the hairs. And it's dense. It's done its senescence and started fading.
[01:15:59.920 --> 01:16:04.320]  It's showing me that it's finishing its life. Like it's I think it's more about reading the
[01:16:04.320 --> 01:16:10.560]  plant is a big one that we all need to learn more about is just reading the plant. They tell you
[01:16:10.560 --> 01:16:16.800]  when they're finished what they need, you know. You know, that you hit the nail on the head right
[01:16:16.800 --> 01:16:22.160]  there because that is that is the problem is a lot of people don't know the plant. And that's why
[01:16:22.160 --> 01:16:27.200]  it takes a few times to really get to understand her and how she's moving and moving through her
[01:16:27.200 --> 01:16:32.720]  life cycles. But yeah, the money is always going to be the problem when when it comes to big
[01:16:32.720 --> 01:16:38.160]  commercial grows. It's like how many how can I fit another running? Fuck, fuck the customer, right?
[01:16:39.280 --> 01:16:45.200]  Which is crazy. But for the audience, the listeners out there. Yeah, definitely educate yourself,
[01:16:45.200 --> 01:16:51.040]  but understand you need to trust the process and trust the girl. If you're doing everything right,
[01:16:51.040 --> 01:16:56.000]  she will show you she will she tell you that you're doing the right things. And if you're not,
[01:16:56.000 --> 01:17:00.800]  she's going to tell you that she doesn't like what you're doing. So that's that's experience.
[01:17:00.800 --> 01:17:06.400]  And that's priceless. But you know, how do you start? I think that Durand was great advice.
[01:17:06.400 --> 01:17:11.600]  Don't fuck around with seeds because you're going to have issues. You're going to need to
[01:17:11.600 --> 01:17:17.120]  chase the males out of there. It's a it's a different animal completely. Then just starting
[01:17:17.120 --> 01:17:21.520]  with a friend's cut. But again, make sure it's a clean cut or you're just going to bring in all
[01:17:21.520 --> 01:17:28.240]  kinds of problems. It's really the catch 22 for beginner farmers like which way do I go because
[01:17:28.240 --> 01:17:32.880]  I don't have skill sets really to manage either one. And I feel like a lot of people out there,
[01:17:32.880 --> 01:17:37.920]  unfortunately, when they do pass out clones, even even the homie to homie, it's not the best
[01:17:37.920 --> 01:17:44.640]  genetics that you got in the stable or rarely is. So I feel like sometimes that you do shoot
[01:17:44.640 --> 01:17:51.040]  yourself in the foot with either way. So I would like to know, Stiggy, what do you think on that?
[01:17:51.600 --> 01:17:56.560]  Like if you just got feminine, like if you're so new to this, should you just maybe buy
[01:17:56.560 --> 01:18:01.280]  feminized seeds? Or if you're super, super new, maybe maybe run the auto flowers?
[01:18:02.160 --> 01:18:08.480]  That's more of a question. If I'm brand new to this and I can have access to seeds over clones
[01:18:08.480 --> 01:18:12.240]  easier, you know what I mean? A lot of people aren't tapped in to have good clones,
[01:18:12.960 --> 01:18:20.880]  but say I can get seeds easier. Yeah, I would run. Not the auto flowers, that's for sure.
[01:18:20.880 --> 01:18:26.560]  I'm not a big auto flower fan, but I know there's a lot of people catching up to it nowadays that
[01:18:26.560 --> 01:18:31.360]  changed my mind with they showed me some buds look pretty, pretty good. But yeah, I would just
[01:18:31.360 --> 01:18:37.040]  get some. What'd you say this? The feminized? Yeah, sorry. Yeah, we get the feminized because
[01:18:37.040 --> 01:18:42.800]  there are good breeders out there that are working with stable pollen donors that they
[01:18:42.800 --> 01:18:48.880]  have selected. I mean, stable as in you're not going to find bananas popping out three and four,
[01:18:49.440 --> 01:18:56.000]  a third of the way up the plant. And as a as a new farmer, you don't even realize all those
[01:18:56.000 --> 01:19:01.200]  kind of nuances with that kind of stuff. And if you paid a pretty, pretty penny for some of those
[01:19:01.200 --> 01:19:05.920]  genetics again, you feel slighted with that when you as you advance as a farmer and you find out
[01:19:05.920 --> 01:19:11.120]  like, man, this dude sold me this bullshit over here and he probably had a whole truck full of it
[01:19:11.760 --> 01:19:14.560]  when he could have probably taken the time to put real genetics down.
[01:19:15.600 --> 01:19:20.560]  So I feel like we say this a lot in the show, but there are just so many people out there that
[01:19:21.120 --> 01:19:26.320]  kind of get scammed with that or set up everything. And genetics is really the last
[01:19:26.320 --> 01:19:32.080]  thing they think of. And I feel like if you're beginning or you're thinking through the winter
[01:19:32.080 --> 01:19:37.600]  on wanting to do this for twenty, twenty two, genetics should be at the forefront of what you're
[01:19:37.600 --> 01:19:43.120]  running. And obviously genetics are at the forefront of what what it takes to stand out.
[01:19:43.760 --> 01:19:49.760]  And Stoney Jacks, obviously, proof of that, you know, you kind of like analogy, I guess you took
[01:19:49.760 --> 01:19:53.760]  some you took someone else's beat. Right. And then you put a hook on that. Right. Because you
[01:19:53.760 --> 01:20:00.000]  didn't create those genetics. But at the same time, you took your own artwork, your style of farming,
[01:20:01.200 --> 01:20:06.720]  and you were able to enter that into a contest and and and take home a trophy. And I feel like
[01:20:06.720 --> 01:20:11.600]  that is really the cool part of cannabis is when you are farming with a living soil system,
[01:20:11.600 --> 01:20:16.800]  if you understand the system, you're able to catch up on the competition in just a few years.
[01:20:17.360 --> 01:20:22.320]  And that's really how long I do feel like it takes. If you want to get to the upper echelons
[01:20:22.320 --> 01:20:27.120]  of cannabis, this has got to be at least maybe a four or five year commitment of you understanding
[01:20:27.120 --> 01:20:33.600]  I'm going to make a lot of mistakes as I continue to progress. But if you're pre-planning being a
[01:20:33.600 --> 01:20:38.880]  proactive farmer, you can minimize most of those mistakes. So now this is what at least in the
[01:20:38.880 --> 01:20:43.600]  poker world we used to call now we're running with calculated risk. Yes, there's risk, but we've
[01:20:43.600 --> 01:20:48.560]  calculated that through and we should be successful with our cannabis endeavors. And
[01:20:49.200 --> 01:20:53.840]  Stoney Jax, I mean, you let's talk about more of the facility that you're at. I mean, I know you're
[01:20:53.840 --> 01:20:58.480]  in a commercial that's kind of everybody's dream, right? Especially growing up in Georgia, you know,
[01:20:58.480 --> 01:21:03.840]  we had to smoke the brown frown most of our life or go down to Atlanta and risk a lot of things,
[01:21:03.840 --> 01:21:08.800]  to be honest, to go to underground Atlanta and talk to random strangers trying to find weed.
[01:21:09.440 --> 01:21:14.560]  And now we're here on a whole nother level out in Colorado where we can cultivate that. We have
[01:21:14.560 --> 01:21:18.000]  friends that are cultivating that. So what are some of the things that you're now seeing? What
[01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:26.480]  are ways you're improving your own facility at the commercial level? So right now at this facility,
[01:21:26.480 --> 01:21:33.760]  I just got to this facility in June. It's a 20,000 square foot grow. We're about at half
[01:21:33.760 --> 01:21:41.200]  capacity right now. We're still in the build out process. So it's really about just getting
[01:21:41.200 --> 01:21:46.240]  the environments dialed in. That's kind of what our biggest project right now, because once the
[01:21:46.240 --> 01:21:54.320]  environments are dialed in, the nutrients and stuff are second to me. Environment is key. And
[01:21:54.320 --> 01:22:00.080]  then once you get the environment down, the nutrients are uptaken correctly, because the
[01:22:00.080 --> 01:22:06.160]  plant is transpiring correctly and all that. So that's where we're at on that. It's just every
[01:22:06.160 --> 01:22:14.640]  day just pulling up our system. We have sensors all through grow. And I can go show you whenever
[01:22:14.640 --> 01:22:25.840]  you guys want to see the grow. But yeah, that's me. But yeah, each flower room right now here has
[01:22:26.560 --> 01:22:32.880]  80 HPS light. One flower room is completely turned off because they're waiting for a license
[01:22:34.160 --> 01:22:42.000]  to go up. But right now it's literally just rocking the environment. Nutrients is kind of
[01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:47.520]  easy already, because I've been doing it for some time now. But here at this facility, what has been
[01:22:47.520 --> 01:22:55.440]  new for me is I actually get a chance to mix raw salt. So even though I am on more of the organic
[01:22:56.160 --> 01:23:02.400]  page, I prefer organics. I like that I am still part of the salt nutrition
[01:23:03.360 --> 01:23:10.160]  fam, the science fam, you know. And I'm going deeper in that by mixing our own. And
[01:23:11.520 --> 01:23:12.720]  I don't know, I forgot where I was going.
[01:23:15.760 --> 01:23:17.600]  No problem. Everybody gets high on this show.
[01:23:20.240 --> 01:23:21.440]  Myself included on that.
[01:23:22.400 --> 01:23:29.120]  So let's ask this question then. Are you using any microbial products in conjunction with your salt?
[01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:38.640]  Yeah. So here we do mycorrhizae. That's part of our transplant. So one gallon and five gallons.
[01:23:38.640 --> 01:23:45.200]  And then we also do the, we have pterogrow, the pterogrow blend that we have that we mix up in
[01:23:45.200 --> 01:23:50.640]  the dirt. That's the little bit of the microbes that we have. And that's pretty much all the
[01:23:50.640 --> 01:24:02.570]  microbes that we have. So I don't know if you heard of this gentleman called Michael Hinden.
[01:24:03.690 --> 01:24:10.810]  He was unfortunately taken away from us way too young, but he did some really interesting work
[01:24:10.810 --> 01:24:16.410]  with low EC salts. Modern epigenetics. I feel like you probably know that.
[01:24:16.410 --> 01:24:24.330]  Yeah. Modern epigenetics is his brainchild that his love still is operating under. And they're
[01:24:24.330 --> 01:24:30.170]  doing some great work with genetics for those out there who are want a safe feminized genetic,
[01:24:30.170 --> 01:24:36.490]  highly recommend you get a whole degree at modern epigenetics. But anyway, back to the reason I
[01:24:36.490 --> 01:24:44.410]  asked these questions is because I took some of his low EC. So again, it's salt based and put it
[01:24:44.410 --> 01:24:49.690]  into compost to see what would happen with the microbes. And I actually increased the microbial
[01:24:49.690 --> 01:24:58.570]  level. So I know that there's a way to balance the use of salts alongside of a complete microbial
[01:24:58.570 --> 01:25:04.650]  community and have solid results. So that's the reason why I asked him. And I would recommend
[01:25:04.650 --> 01:25:12.170]  that you try get a hold of fishbrew.com, buy a five gallon jug of their bold flow and apply it
[01:25:12.170 --> 01:25:16.730]  to some of your plants just to see what happens. But I guarantee you're going to see a plant
[01:25:16.730 --> 01:25:22.970]  reaction. Those microbes do a wonderful job of breaking apart the nutrients that are still locked
[01:25:22.970 --> 01:25:30.010]  up. A lot of the salt nutrient will build up in the soil because as the salts build up, so you're
[01:25:30.010 --> 01:25:37.450]  losing nutritional value. And these guys will come along and open that up and release it to the plant
[01:25:37.450 --> 01:25:45.210]  available. So try it because I recall what you see. Say again, beer called the EC that you were
[01:25:45.210 --> 01:25:51.210]  using with the microbe. They were so low. It's like point point oh seven, I think or point seven.
[01:25:51.210 --> 01:25:56.810]  So really, really low. As a matter of fact, a good friend of mine who was a commercial grower in
[01:25:56.810 --> 01:26:02.410]  Colorado, who bailed out of the industry because he just was horrified at what the fuck was being
[01:26:02.410 --> 01:26:09.210]  sold. He went on to do a commercial lettuce and he was actually on the show at one point.
[01:26:09.210 --> 01:26:15.290]  I sent it to him and have him analyze it and look at it. He's like, yeah, I wouldn't use this.
[01:26:16.490 --> 01:26:22.170]  There's not enough nutrient in it. And I'm like, well, that's because it's not the only source.
[01:26:22.170 --> 01:26:28.890]  You're using microbes in conjunction with this to get that full potential, the full plant potential
[01:26:28.890 --> 01:26:35.130]  or plant expression. And so, yeah, he's still playing with the formula. He's going to come
[01:26:35.130 --> 01:26:43.290]  back at some point with another way to produce it with more stable components, because unfortunately,
[01:26:43.290 --> 01:26:47.450]  the mix that Michael had come up with, which again, this kid was a fucking genius.
[01:26:48.810 --> 01:26:54.570]  You had to mix it exactly right portions in the exact right order or it didn't work. And I still
[01:26:54.570 --> 01:27:01.130]  to this day can't figure out why that is. But now you're talking about alchemy, not chemistry.
[01:27:01.130 --> 01:27:07.450]  So it's a different animal. And way back in the day when I was at Rodale, Elaine always told me,
[01:27:08.250 --> 01:27:13.130]  no fertilizers, don't ever fuck with fertilizers. I did because she's told me not to.
[01:27:14.890 --> 01:27:21.770]  And I did find ways to use the combination. But again, the biggest problem was you had to
[01:27:21.770 --> 01:27:27.370]  continuously use more microbes because you killed a lot of them as they came in contact with those
[01:27:27.370 --> 01:27:35.210]  salts. And in a no-till living bed system, the goal is to cut back on the inputs, not increase
[01:27:35.210 --> 01:27:40.010]  on it. But in a large commercial grow, you guys understand that you're going to be tearing through
[01:27:40.010 --> 01:27:45.050]  nutrients. You're going to be paying for them. So add that microbial solution, my friend,
[01:27:45.050 --> 01:27:48.330]  and watch those plants freak the fuck out on you. Dr. Pompa.
[01:27:48.330 --> 01:27:53.050]  Yeah, I would definitely like to do that. So one hurdle with being in the commercial
[01:27:53.050 --> 01:27:58.010]  grow is that I might be managing this, but I have hurdles that I have to
[01:27:59.370 --> 01:28:06.330]  jump through to add new products into the facility. We have testing, we also have to persuade the
[01:28:06.330 --> 01:28:15.210]  higher ups to run all the numbers. So it's a hard one to change. I never come into a commercial
[01:28:15.210 --> 01:28:22.570]  grow anymore to try to change too much because I stressed myself out in the past with trying to
[01:28:22.570 --> 01:28:28.890]  help these grows be better and they just don't want to be better. So I've kind of learned to
[01:28:28.890 --> 01:28:33.930]  like just I'm here to grow commercial cannabis. I'm still going to try to do it as best as I can,
[01:28:34.650 --> 01:28:40.090]  but there's only certain limitations that I can change and certain things that I can do on my end.
[01:28:40.650 --> 01:28:42.250]  Yeah, the politics of it all, right?
[01:28:42.970 --> 01:28:43.610]  Exactly.
[01:28:45.370 --> 01:28:50.970]  Well, and it's like we had mentioned, it's cutthroat. So like if maybe not the highest
[01:28:50.970 --> 01:28:56.330]  up agrees with you, they run with you on trying to improve some things. And let's say that it
[01:28:56.330 --> 01:28:59.930]  doesn't work out for whatever reason, those people are probably going to lose their position as well.
[01:29:01.370 --> 01:29:06.170]  If you're farming and let's say it's not even the best, but you're actually producing where
[01:29:07.050 --> 01:29:13.210]  the cannabis is being sold, it is extremely hard to get anybody to ever hear you out on anything
[01:29:13.770 --> 01:29:15.370]  besides how the train is moving.
[01:29:16.810 --> 01:29:21.610]  And that's the crazy part is that they're pigeonholed their asses. I mean, you should
[01:29:21.610 --> 01:29:28.010]  be doing side by sides, never ending. You need an R&D department. You can't just do the same old
[01:29:28.010 --> 01:29:33.450]  shit over and over again and expect different results. What is that called? Fucking insanity.
[01:29:33.850 --> 01:29:39.930]  The insanity of humanity. But anyway, and especially if you have pots, there's no reason
[01:29:39.930 --> 01:29:44.330]  why you can't put something in one pot and not in the other and just watch what the fuck happens.
[01:29:45.370 --> 01:29:52.970]  So that's my bitch to the corporate bullshit is that you really are not being a smart person
[01:29:53.530 --> 01:30:00.570]  if you're not proactively testing and looking to develop new and better and affordable systems.
[01:30:00.810 --> 01:30:05.210]  You're just spinning your fucking wheels. That's my bitch.
[01:30:05.210 --> 01:30:10.650]  Yeah. So that we'll be able to do something like that. Well, the way we have to do it here is
[01:30:10.650 --> 01:30:17.050]  we'll have to do a test. I can probably do like one full table as an organic bed. It would
[01:30:17.050 --> 01:30:22.650]  probably have to not be brought up first, but then shown the results of the end process.
[01:30:24.090 --> 01:30:28.170]  It'd be something like that. But also in the commercial setup, like right now,
[01:30:28.250 --> 01:30:35.050]  we're about to get our rec licenses and go up to 2400. So with that extreme bump in plant count,
[01:30:35.050 --> 01:30:40.650]  that opens up a lot more leeway to do these projects instead of being on just a strict
[01:30:40.650 --> 01:30:47.850]  harvest, harvest, harvest mindset. When you have one hell of a facility,
[01:30:47.850 --> 01:30:53.050]  if you have the ability to eventually farm 20,000 square feet indoors, that's a
[01:30:53.530 --> 01:30:56.970]  what is that like half a Walmart? It's a huge place.
[01:30:58.010 --> 01:31:03.050]  Yeah. Yeah. You guys want to see any plants? Yeah. We want to see that.
[01:31:03.050 --> 01:31:08.570]  Oh yeah. All right. Let's go. Let's see how I change this camera.
[01:31:09.210 --> 01:31:15.770]  So tap on the settings and then you should see like a camera and you can pick like the front
[01:31:16.330 --> 01:31:20.090]  camera. Yeah. I'll see. Yep.
[01:31:22.090 --> 01:31:29.700]  We see him laying on his phone. He had fat fingers. He had it for a second.
[01:31:31.300 --> 01:31:35.700]  What are you hitting, dude? I got a cherry pie face today.
[01:31:38.180 --> 01:31:40.180]  There we go. Now we see you. All right.
[01:31:40.180 --> 01:31:45.540]  So this is going to be our bedroom right here. I'm going to go turn the fans off real quick
[01:31:45.540 --> 01:31:56.680]  so I can hear you guys. You know, it's a legit grow when you have the yellow top bin.
[01:32:00.360 --> 01:32:06.980]  All right. So these are our mother plant. That's what I'm going to be doing.
[01:32:06.980 --> 01:32:17.780]  All right. So these are our mother plant back in the back. This room is all lit with
[01:32:18.580 --> 01:32:28.740]  630 ceramic metal halide. There's all the moms back there. This is the generation
[01:32:29.380 --> 01:32:34.260]  that will be going into flower next in these two rows that I'm standing in between.
[01:32:35.060 --> 01:32:43.930]  How many times do you up pot? It looks like at least twice, right?
[01:32:44.490 --> 01:32:49.370]  Yeah. So we go from clone to one gallon and then one gallon to five gallon
[01:32:50.490 --> 01:32:54.890]  and then the five gallons go into flower. Four weeks veg.
[01:32:56.650 --> 01:33:04.290]  What cultivars you running now? All right. So we have right now, since this is a new facility,
[01:33:04.290 --> 01:33:09.330]  we had to get clones from Clone Colorado because they're already in the Colorado metric.
[01:33:09.570 --> 01:33:14.530]  So we are running Animal Mints, Cake Crasher, Cherry Punch, Divine Christmas,
[01:33:14.530 --> 01:33:21.410]  Garanimals, Blue Ball, Gorilla Breath, Grace Lane, Ice Cream Man, Lava Cake, Super Booth,
[01:33:21.410 --> 01:33:29.950]  Tropicana Banana, Tropic Santo, and Violet Dixon. It's quite a selection you got there.
[01:33:31.070 --> 01:33:38.990]  Yeah. We're going to try to get to 14 to 16 strains in rotation and we process, we grow
[01:33:39.150 --> 01:33:45.310]  we process, we grow strictly for fresh frozen right now for our lab. So none of this product,
[01:33:45.310 --> 01:33:51.070]  or once we go to flower, you'll see none of the product goes to flower consumption. It's
[01:33:51.070 --> 01:34:00.270]  all extracted into either rosin or live resin from here. So you don't sell any flower? No. So
[01:34:00.910 --> 01:34:06.030]  we don't sell any flower here. All the products that we pull from this commercial facility
[01:34:06.030 --> 01:34:11.070]  is frozen and then a driver from our lab up in Denver comes and picks it up.
[01:34:11.790 --> 01:34:16.510]  And then they do whatever they do, the process. We usually don't even see the end product.
[01:34:18.270 --> 01:34:23.790]  I feel like the market's changed and I would imagine that's why you do that. Is the,
[01:34:23.790 --> 01:34:29.790]  just more and more people that are, their tolerance is building up with DAB more often?
[01:34:30.750 --> 01:34:36.670]  Yeah, every, everybody, it's the commercial side right now is definitely going to extracts
[01:34:36.670 --> 01:34:44.030]  and it's all DAB, rosin right now, which is great. I personally do prefer flower
[01:34:44.030 --> 01:34:52.030]  and I prefer the like ice water hash, the more natural processes. But to each their own.
[01:34:55.060 --> 01:35:00.500]  So this is veg and then I'm about to walk over to flower. Connection might get a little
[01:35:02.020 --> 01:35:02.980]  a little iffy.
[01:35:05.620 --> 01:35:11.380]  There's only three of us here in the facility. We have a onsite mechanic contractor and it's
[01:35:11.380 --> 01:35:15.380]  myself and the operations director that run the facility right now.
[01:35:17.940 --> 01:35:26.580]  This is one of our flower rooms that's currently running. Let me see if I can. There we go.
[01:35:27.220 --> 01:35:31.770]  Can you guys hear me?
[01:35:33.610 --> 01:35:35.210]  Yep. You sound, you sound great.
[01:35:36.970 --> 01:35:37.850]  Can you do a close up?
[01:35:39.770 --> 01:35:40.490]  Yeah, definitely.
[01:35:43.370 --> 01:35:44.810]  The old Instagram trick.
[01:35:44.810 --> 01:35:51.370]  Yeah, I'm filming through the glasses so we can see the different color. Because if I wasn't,
[01:35:51.370 --> 01:35:56.810]  then it's all yellow like this. So I'm filming through method seven to try to get a better
[01:35:57.130 --> 01:36:02.090]  picture of these nugs for you guys. Let's see.
[01:36:02.090 --> 01:36:03.930]  We appreciate the extra effort.
[01:36:05.770 --> 01:36:09.760]  We're all on rolling tables.
[01:36:09.760 --> 01:36:11.280]  When is this due to harvest?
[01:36:12.160 --> 01:36:16.160]  So these two tables that I'm in between right now will be harvesting next Wednesday.
[01:36:18.080 --> 01:36:26.560]  And you're able to control how long they go through flower or you just being told you have
[01:36:26.560 --> 01:36:27.120]  to harvest?
[01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:34.720]  We're controlling it. We're on a seven week cycle. So it's still commercial growing,
[01:36:34.720 --> 01:36:38.880]  but we're still pushing these as long as we can. We're doing a two week flush,
[01:36:38.880 --> 01:36:45.520]  which a lot of commercial facilities don't do out here. For some reason. I think with using
[01:36:45.520 --> 01:36:52.080]  salt, you kind of need a flush. Because then you don't get these nice fades, fades of brown,
[01:36:52.560 --> 01:36:55.280]  fades of brown, brown, burgundy.
[01:37:00.290 --> 01:37:04.850]  Plus, well, for whatever reason, when you do flush, it does help to get some of the harshness
[01:37:04.850 --> 01:37:09.570]  out of the weed. I smoked some commercial shit up here going on salt and it burned the back of
[01:37:09.570 --> 01:37:10.690]  my fucking throat.
[01:37:10.690 --> 01:37:15.650]  Every other mindset is going towards what I've been hearing is like, you don't have to flush.
[01:37:16.210 --> 01:37:20.850]  But I don't know how, how well that is to me. I think you do need a flush.
[01:37:21.730 --> 01:37:27.490]  I'm not too big on the extracting side just yet because I'm so in love with
[01:37:27.490 --> 01:37:34.290]  growing plants at the moment. I just like being around these guys, gals.
[01:37:35.490 --> 01:37:40.850]  So when did you decide to go after this dream? What year was that? 2015? Is that right?
[01:37:40.850 --> 01:37:46.050]  Yeah. 2015, me and my fiance moved out here with absolutely nothing.
[01:37:47.410 --> 01:37:49.890]  And here you are six years later, real time.
[01:37:49.970 --> 01:37:56.050]  Six years later, definitely making moves for sure. Not where I want to be, but
[01:37:57.330 --> 01:37:58.610]  there's still plenty of time.
[01:38:01.170 --> 01:38:02.290]  Yeah, there's my baby.
[01:38:06.160 --> 01:38:10.560]  So, you know, that was an interesting question about whether you have to flush or not,
[01:38:10.560 --> 01:38:14.400]  if you're going fresh, frozen and off to extract. I don't know if it would really,
[01:38:15.120 --> 01:38:17.600]  I don't know if that's going to affect anything. So maybe that is a
[01:38:18.720 --> 01:38:20.560]  valid point that you don't need to.
[01:38:20.560 --> 01:38:25.600]  Yeah, I'm not quite too sure on it, but I know from a flower side, in my opinion,
[01:38:25.600 --> 01:38:27.600]  if you don't flush your flower is harsh.
[01:38:28.240 --> 01:38:33.560]  Let's ask Sticky on that. Sticky, what do you think?
[01:38:34.280 --> 01:38:36.120]  Oh, I thought you said something else. What did you say?
[01:38:37.400 --> 01:38:38.120]  About flushing?
[01:38:39.240 --> 01:38:41.000]  Do you want to ask the question again, Stoney Jax?
[01:38:41.560 --> 01:38:46.840]  Yeah. So basically the question is, in my experience, if you're going to smoke the
[01:38:46.840 --> 01:38:52.840]  flower, you have to flush what's going to be harsh. And we're in agreement, but Sticky,
[01:38:52.840 --> 01:38:53.560]  what's your opinion?
[01:38:54.520 --> 01:38:58.760]  I definitely think so. I mean, even at the last commercial facility I worked at, we
[01:38:58.760 --> 01:39:04.120]  tried flushing and not flushing. And the flower from the unflushed was noticeably
[01:39:04.840 --> 01:39:10.520]  darker in ash. I don't know if that really means a lot, but it definitely burned harsher
[01:39:10.520 --> 01:39:15.560]  and the feel of the back of the throat. So I prefer a flush whenever possible.
[01:39:17.320 --> 01:39:21.640]  I mean, it feels like common sense, but at the same time, I want to kind of hear your
[01:39:21.640 --> 01:39:26.600]  opinion on that on the back end, because there are a lot of people that are now saying that
[01:39:26.600 --> 01:39:33.480]  you don't need to. But I also think that might come with the skill set of the farmer and
[01:39:33.480 --> 01:39:37.240]  how long they've been doing that. Are they like a PhD level botanist?
[01:39:38.200 --> 01:39:46.200]  I think the amount of salt they pushed also plays a role in if you need to flush or not,
[01:39:46.200 --> 01:39:52.440]  because what I've noticed in most of these facilities is they push really hard. It's
[01:39:52.440 --> 01:39:58.600]  the mindset of more is more, and it's just not the case usually.
[01:40:00.600 --> 01:40:05.480]  Well, I don't know how other facilities work, but some of the facilities that I worked at
[01:40:05.560 --> 01:40:10.040]  the head of grower, maybe the assistant head grower and some head trimmers or something like
[01:40:10.040 --> 01:40:15.720]  that, we would get a bonus based on they would set a certain level for you. If you got more
[01:40:15.720 --> 01:40:22.520]  cannabis over that threshold, then they would give you a bonus on that. The silly thing is,
[01:40:22.520 --> 01:40:28.040]  is next month or a month after that, the goal would be set higher. So it's always just pushed
[01:40:28.040 --> 01:40:32.840]  and pushed and pushed to where it's some things are just not attainable like that unless you
[01:40:32.920 --> 01:40:39.000]  start really pumping your cannabis with basically steroids.
[01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:39.640]  Steroids.
[01:40:39.640 --> 01:40:40.120]  Yeah.
[01:40:40.120 --> 01:40:44.760]  Yeah. Or just growing natural PGRs.
[01:40:46.760 --> 01:40:55.340]  So from the back end of getting your cannabis to fresh frozen and that kind of stuff,
[01:40:55.340 --> 01:40:58.540]  can you go through that process for people that might not understand
[01:40:58.540 --> 01:41:02.700]  those nuances as a farmer and understanding what it is that you're doing?
[01:41:03.020 --> 01:41:07.820]  Understanding what it takes to put your, you know, the guidelines that you have to
[01:41:07.820 --> 01:41:12.220]  to abide by with the genetics that you have to use, because they have to be in a certain system
[01:41:12.220 --> 01:41:17.820]  here in Colorado. It's metric, I think in other states it's something different, but I feel like
[01:41:17.820 --> 01:41:22.140]  for everybody around those, that's another little gold nugget. I don't think enough people
[01:41:23.180 --> 01:41:27.820]  realize that they need to understand to be a commercial farmer is you really need to understand
[01:41:28.780 --> 01:41:30.060]  that A to Z as well.
[01:41:32.860 --> 01:41:40.460]  Yeah. So there's definitely a lot of hoops to go through. Nothing can come into the facility
[01:41:41.100 --> 01:41:45.980]  that isn't already in Colorado metric. So if you're a new facility and you're trying to start,
[01:41:47.580 --> 01:41:51.820]  there's only a certain amount of seed companies. I think Dark Horse is one that's in Colorado
[01:41:51.820 --> 01:41:58.380]  metric, but it has to be in the system, but you can get it from any facility. So
[01:41:59.180 --> 01:42:02.780]  a lot of facilities have that secret, you know, they don't like to share, but
[01:42:03.580 --> 01:42:09.500]  as the growers usually hook up and get talking, the growth community is really nice. You start
[01:42:09.500 --> 01:42:14.780]  meeting different people and you can start getting into these better genetics instead of getting the
[01:42:14.780 --> 01:42:20.460]  genetics that everyone has, like from Clone Colorado, which is the big, the biggest clone
[01:42:20.460 --> 01:42:28.300]  provider here in Colorado of already metric clones. But what we're doing in the, in this
[01:42:28.300 --> 01:42:34.300]  next couple of weeks is we're going to trade with another facility that my friend works at. And as
[01:42:34.300 --> 01:42:40.140]  long as it has a paper trail, it has to have a paper trail. If a plant is in the facility in there,
[01:42:40.140 --> 01:42:47.340]  it's got its own little tag and it goes with it all the way till we harvest it. And we even put
[01:42:47.340 --> 01:42:52.620]  the tags in with the fresh frozen packages, just so that's a little extra step. Like, Hey,
[01:42:52.620 --> 01:42:59.420]  this tag started its life as a one gallon pot, and it's now ended its life in this bag of fresh
[01:42:59.420 --> 01:43:08.530]  frozen material. And do you see the trends kind of moving towards fresh frozen in Colorado Springs?
[01:43:08.530 --> 01:43:16.050]  Cause it's, I know it's not as populated, but at the same time, it seems like almost anywhere
[01:43:16.050 --> 01:43:21.570]  in Colorado, people are pretty well educated on the fact of what is quality and what isn't
[01:43:21.570 --> 01:43:28.690]  from flower all the way to concentrate. Yeah. Fresh frozen seems to be the biggest push right now
[01:43:29.410 --> 01:43:35.890]  in, in the industry. I think a big part of it is you can kind of hide your discrepancies a lot
[01:43:35.890 --> 01:43:41.570]  better with doing the concentrate. So I think that is, that plays a, that's a variable in why
[01:43:42.450 --> 01:43:48.290]  concentrates are getting pushed so hard is I feel like the, the grows aren't up to par, honestly.
[01:43:48.290 --> 01:43:54.130]  So you gotta, you can kind of remediate that, those, the growth steps through the extraction
[01:43:54.130 --> 01:44:05.560]  process and you get these homogenized sledges, you know? I feel like that's, I guess, you know,
[01:44:06.360 --> 01:44:09.720]  people know that, but at the same time, I don't feel like enough people know that.
[01:44:10.600 --> 01:44:15.000]  That's why again, Sticky, you know, with the homegrowers cup, man, I, I like that you
[01:44:15.640 --> 01:44:21.880]  specifically like signaled out those individuals cause from, you know, the two events, I feel like
[01:44:21.880 --> 01:44:26.600]  there's a starting to be a little small roster of people that are continuing to kind of ride the
[01:44:26.600 --> 01:44:31.960]  waves of kind of what you, what you started, man, is you kind of planted the flag for
[01:44:32.680 --> 01:44:40.360]  a cup where people respected it on a, on a peer to peer level. So hopefully, you know,
[01:44:40.360 --> 01:44:45.160]  we can get that back in and then there'll be a lot more Stony Jack individuals that hopefully
[01:44:45.160 --> 01:44:49.960]  pop up in maybe a year or two from now that continue to educate themselves, farm and can
[01:44:49.960 --> 01:44:58.440]  surpass, you know, a majority of cannabis farmers that, that don't see this as the future. I know
[01:44:58.440 --> 01:45:02.440]  that we're biased on this show, but I feel like you might be able to surpass a lot of these
[01:45:02.440 --> 01:45:08.440]  individuals that have been farming for a long time. If the, the market starts to turn more to
[01:45:08.440 --> 01:45:13.240]  quality and I hope, you know, that's why we do the show all the time is I hope that eventually it
[01:45:13.240 --> 01:45:17.880]  does turn to where more and more people, like examples are always like at Walmart, right?
[01:45:18.520 --> 01:45:22.680]  When more and more people want to actually purchase organic, it forces those major brands
[01:45:22.680 --> 01:45:27.160]  that don't want to do, you know, put in the money to have organic. Now it's obviously there on the
[01:45:27.160 --> 01:45:33.080]  shelves. And we can obviously do that on a very small level, influencing things by just spending
[01:45:33.080 --> 01:45:40.200]  your money where it's, it's a medicinal value. And that's a drastic difference from, I don't know
[01:45:40.200 --> 01:45:44.760]  the exact percentage, man, but it definitely feels like sticky. The three fourths of the,
[01:45:44.760 --> 01:45:49.800]  the dispensaries out there really could give a fuck less about medicinal value to anybody.
[01:45:50.920 --> 01:45:55.480]  They don't even hook up their employees with like RSO or something like that when they have just
[01:45:55.480 --> 01:45:59.560]  gobs of it in the back. There's a lot of them out there. That's for sure.
[01:46:00.200 --> 01:46:05.000]  But, you know, there's a few still trying to do it right. They're trying to do the best they can
[01:46:07.240 --> 01:46:12.680]  to put themselves out there as a different kind of operation. I think, like we say,
[01:46:12.680 --> 01:46:20.440]  it's important to seek them out. Don't just buy the hype strain company stuff all the time. It's
[01:46:20.440 --> 01:46:26.120]  sure it's a steady, good stuff usually, but maybe there's something better out there that
[01:46:26.120 --> 01:46:29.720]  you haven't tried. Just doesn't get the love everything else does.
[01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:34.760]  Yep. Vote with your wallet people. That's most important thing you can do.
[01:46:37.240 --> 01:46:41.080]  Well, and I wanted to pick your brain, Stoney Jaxx on this aspect of,
[01:46:42.120 --> 01:46:45.720]  so people with their wallets, with their time, that's the main thing that I really,
[01:46:45.720 --> 01:46:50.360]  especially, I guess, as you get older, that's the thing that's fucking really important. I feel like
[01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:56.600]  is your time. So are there people that you maybe have learned from some books that you have read
[01:46:56.600 --> 01:47:02.440]  that you feel like was worth the effort that aren't necessarily mainstream? I know Jeff
[01:47:02.440 --> 01:47:06.120]  Lowenfeld's books. I feel like everybody kind of knows that aspect. Yeah, that's exactly where I'll
[01:47:06.120 --> 01:47:16.040]  go. But the Cannabis Encyclopedia is a good one. But right now, education-wise, it's more on
[01:47:16.040 --> 01:47:24.360]  the internet that I recommend people go to. Let's see. I guess for introductory type of
[01:47:25.560 --> 01:47:32.760]  podcast, it's like more educational, dip your feet in. It's more entertainment with education
[01:47:32.760 --> 01:47:39.640]  there. Like the Dude Grows show is really good for those that aren't good with big words.
[01:47:39.880 --> 01:47:47.480]  Other than that, like the Growcast, the Cannabis Cultivation Science Podcast,
[01:47:49.800 --> 01:47:56.040]  any of those, Rasta Jeff, Ari Gines, he's really chill. So it's more about like
[01:47:57.480 --> 01:48:06.440]  your own characteristics. You can line up, there's education-heavy and then there's
[01:48:07.320 --> 01:48:13.000]  entertainment-heavy. You just got to pick up what lines with you roll with it and just continue
[01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:18.920]  soaking it in. And I think that's the biggest part of getting ahead in this industry is just
[01:48:18.920 --> 01:48:23.720]  the education. It's continuously changing. And those that just think that they've already figured
[01:48:23.720 --> 01:48:28.760]  it out and they're fine with what they're doing, they're not going to continue to progress in this
[01:48:28.760 --> 01:48:38.440]  industry because so many new people are coming in this industry. It's forever evolving. And to just
[01:48:38.440 --> 01:48:43.560]  be stuck in one way is I think a dumb way to approach this industry, this growing industry.
[01:48:46.600 --> 01:48:53.000]  I agree 100%. We're learning so much now as a species at such a fast clip that
[01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:58.200]  if you're not continuing to learn, then you are what's called stagnating. And you're at this
[01:48:58.200 --> 01:49:02.440]  point, it's just called the slippery slope. Because once you stop, man, you're just going
[01:49:02.440 --> 01:49:08.360]  to get run the fuck over. So that's my best advice. And yeah, those podcasts are a lot of fun.
[01:49:08.360 --> 01:49:14.840]  There's also Shaping Fire. I think he does a wonderful job with his interviewed style and
[01:49:14.840 --> 01:49:19.880]  technique. So yeah, please, you guys, you can listen to these things all day long while you're working
[01:49:20.600 --> 01:49:23.240]  and be learning and earning money at the same time.
[01:49:24.200 --> 01:49:29.320]  Sorry, I fell off. So you're talking, I would imagine a variety of podcasts and stuff like that.
[01:49:30.040 --> 01:49:34.200]  I think in this day and age, that really is probably the best ROI is you can kind of do
[01:49:34.200 --> 01:49:38.920]  something else while you're doing that. Usually, if you're really trying to dive deep into a
[01:49:38.920 --> 01:49:45.000]  subject, you have to watch them once or twice or two or three times anyway. So I kind of put them
[01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:49.000]  on the background sometimes and we'll listen to it two times kind of in the background doing
[01:49:49.080 --> 01:49:53.320]  And for me personally, I feel like I'm able to retain things a lot better that way
[01:49:54.200 --> 01:49:57.640]  is just listening to the same podcast maybe two or three times.
[01:49:59.400 --> 01:50:03.880]  Yeah, you definitely got to keep it keep it coming. And that's been my whole thing since
[01:50:03.880 --> 01:50:11.240]  I moved out here was just to keep the information flow coming. And I think if everyone that's
[01:50:11.240 --> 01:50:16.360]  listening just does that, it's going to be a lot easier to keep the information flowing.
[01:50:16.360 --> 01:50:20.680]  I think if everyone that's listening just does that, if you're trying to get in this industry,
[01:50:21.640 --> 01:50:28.360]  and you can spit out information that will help you in the long run. Also, also finding a niche
[01:50:28.360 --> 01:50:34.040]  because there's so many different routes to get good cannabis. I think finding what resonates
[01:50:34.040 --> 01:50:40.760]  with your own lifestyle also helps with getting the education that you're looking for.
[01:50:40.920 --> 01:50:46.120]  Are you going to be able to like implement different type of like natural farming protocols
[01:50:46.120 --> 01:50:52.120]  into that facility or it's dialed in and in a playbook kind of thing where they want you to
[01:50:52.120 --> 01:50:53.960]  follow step by step?
[01:50:53.960 --> 01:51:01.720]  Right now we are on the more of the playbook where I got to follow because we're still we're
[01:51:01.720 --> 01:51:07.720]  still in the middle of building out we're not at full full running capacity yet. But once we get
[01:51:08.520 --> 01:51:15.560]  But once we get to full running capacity, and there is a overflow of product, then we have a
[01:51:15.560 --> 01:51:24.200]  chance of starting to implement some more microbes or natural processes. But it's, it's also something
[01:51:24.200 --> 01:51:33.480]  that I'm not trying to add that stress onto myself. Because it this is commercial growing,
[01:51:33.480 --> 01:51:40.280]  and this is in my facility. So it's hard. It's that balance. Like I do want to do great,
[01:51:40.280 --> 01:51:47.000]  of course. But just from the past, I don't want to stress myself to death on something that's
[01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:48.200]  not going to get me anywhere, you know?
[01:51:50.600 --> 01:51:57.000]  Yeah, I mean, that's a huge facility. I don't even for newer farmers. I don't think you realize
[01:51:57.880 --> 01:52:03.720]  the majority of the living soil type farms and stuff are 10,000 square feet or less,
[01:52:03.720 --> 01:52:08.600]  it seems like or maybe a few different buildings on a piece of land where there are 2500 square feet.
[01:52:09.320 --> 01:52:14.840]  Sticky, do you see larger facilities in a living soil system besides the ones that are kind of
[01:52:14.840 --> 01:52:22.120]  known transitioning to the big open facilities? Are they usually paying to break them down into
[01:52:22.120 --> 01:52:23.480]  a variety of different rooms?
[01:52:23.560 --> 01:52:30.200]  Man, I've not toured too many facilities. I know there's that one that does the three
[01:52:30.200 --> 01:52:36.120]  tiered living soil in California. Cressibus, I think is who it was.
[01:52:36.680 --> 01:52:38.600]  So hey, guys, just quickly.
[01:52:41.800 --> 01:52:47.160]  I've, I've often or we've all often witnessed Layton's cork being popped.
[01:52:47.320 --> 01:52:50.840]  But I've never seen Brian's cork be popped.
[01:52:53.480 --> 01:52:55.400]  Y'all ready to see Brian's cork popped?
[01:52:56.520 --> 01:52:57.240]  Bring it on.
[01:52:59.480 --> 01:53:00.040]  What up?
[01:53:04.840 --> 01:53:05.960]  What's up, big bro?
[01:53:06.520 --> 01:53:08.120]  Talking about corks getting popped.
[01:53:11.720 --> 01:53:15.560]  Hey, man, it's really good to see you. We mentioned last week that you were out
[01:53:15.800 --> 01:53:20.520]  and for a lot of people out there, while you were behind the scenes, we were able to kind
[01:53:20.520 --> 01:53:25.000]  of update them on things and dispel some rumors that I feel like needed to be squashed.
[01:53:25.960 --> 01:53:30.520]  And so we just I had no idea you're going to be on the show, dude. So I guess that's what
[01:53:30.520 --> 01:53:34.440]  Peter was getting at, man, is just really cool to see the real ones back in action.
[01:53:35.080 --> 01:53:40.280]  I was joking last week with a lot of people that were reaching out. You're kind of the
[01:53:40.360 --> 01:53:45.880]  reaching out. You're kind of the the breeders breeder. You know, within the little upper
[01:53:45.880 --> 01:53:50.840]  echelons, man, there's a lot of respect there that obviously is being shown by, you know,
[01:53:50.840 --> 01:53:55.960]  how quickly your Instagram is growing, man, and things that just real love for for you.
[01:53:55.960 --> 01:54:00.840]  And it's, it's a genuine respect. And I feel like there's so much fake shit out there that
[01:54:00.840 --> 01:54:04.920]  that's why we've always kept it. And just, you know, rocked your hat, man,
[01:54:04.920 --> 01:54:09.000]  wore some shirts and stuff where you're behind there. And it's just fantastic to see you out,
[01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:16.840]  brother. Man, thanks so much, dude. It's good. Good to be back. And yeah, you're right, man.
[01:54:16.840 --> 01:54:24.360]  There's a lot of shit bags out there for sure. But, you know, they only they only fool people
[01:54:24.360 --> 01:54:30.440]  for so long. Anyway, you know, people catch on and be like, dude, so, you know, they're fly by
[01:54:30.440 --> 01:54:35.400]  night, you see them pop up and then, you know, they're, they're gone just as quick as they're
[01:54:35.400 --> 01:54:41.320]  around. So this is how it is, you know, especially like media and shit like that. It's not
[01:54:42.520 --> 01:54:47.640]  like a face to face type thing anymore. And I guess especially now with COVID, you know,
[01:54:47.640 --> 01:54:54.040]  everything's, you know, been internet, internet only. So people weren't knowing who they were
[01:54:54.040 --> 01:54:59.560]  dealing with and shit. And you know, hell, I mean, there's even been people back in the day,
[01:54:59.560 --> 01:55:04.600]  they were like, you know, big into stuff. And then they come out in the public and people are
[01:55:04.600 --> 01:55:11.960]  real fucking douchebag. Like, my old partner, man, like he was real bad about it. You know,
[01:55:11.960 --> 01:55:17.640]  like people got the meaner, man, what are you doing? Working with that? I was like, Yeah, man.
[01:55:18.760 --> 01:55:20.120]  Gotta get away from this guy.
[01:55:22.440 --> 01:55:27.000]  Yeah, so there's a lot of positive things that are kind of going to come. Do you want to share
[01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:30.200]  like maybe even like a little teaser of any of the stuff that you've been working on,
[01:55:30.200 --> 01:55:33.400]  especially when you were behind the scenes? Working on yourself?
[01:55:34.440 --> 01:55:41.960]  Yeah, man. I was writing a book, writing a book while I was in there. And it was just like a how
[01:55:41.960 --> 01:55:49.720]  to how to like do everything like from setting your spot up electrical, plumbing, HVAC, like
[01:55:49.720 --> 01:55:57.160]  literally everything somebody would need to know the setup space, they're moving into, you know,
[01:55:57.160 --> 01:56:04.600]  organic practices, everything from start to finish, drying, maturing, and just being, you
[01:56:04.600 --> 01:56:09.880]  know, trying to make something real complete. And like, you know, talking to it simple, like,
[01:56:09.880 --> 01:56:14.920]  I don't want it to be like a hard textbook or something like that, you know, so.
[01:56:17.160 --> 01:56:20.360]  Well, that's the one thing that resonates with the community, man, is because you,
[01:56:21.080 --> 01:56:25.000]  you're up there, you're spitting knowledge, but at the same time, you're fuck this shit that,
[01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:28.840]  you know, and I know that sometimes, but it resonates with people that you're just,
[01:56:28.840 --> 01:56:32.680]  you're just talking off the cuff, man, you're just you're talking about the shit that you
[01:56:32.680 --> 01:56:36.200]  that you know, when so many people are up there, you're kind of on a,
[01:56:37.080 --> 01:56:42.840]  they have the spotlight for a second. It's just usually bullshit. So that's something that I feel
[01:56:42.840 --> 01:56:47.080]  like the community resonates with you, man, is because you talk on the level that I feel like
[01:56:47.080 --> 01:56:53.160]  a lot of farmers are at. We're not, we're not highly educated individuals, you know, especially
[01:56:53.160 --> 01:56:57.240]  some of us, I'll speak for myself in the South, like public education just wasn't,
[01:56:57.240 --> 01:57:01.480]  it didn't feel like it was important until you got older in life. And you realized, I need to
[01:57:02.280 --> 01:57:07.160]  take some kind of skill set and move on with that. And for a lot of us, we gravitated to farming
[01:57:07.160 --> 01:57:12.840]  cannabis because it was something that we were allowed to kind of take risk with and, and run
[01:57:12.840 --> 01:57:21.000]  with. Yeah, absolutely, man, is like, you know, especially with me, like when I was in school,
[01:57:21.720 --> 01:57:29.480]  um, education and everything was only as good as I could apply it. So like, if I had no,
[01:57:30.760 --> 01:57:35.800]  no way to apply it, or use it or find any use for it, I would just, you know, it would go to the
[01:57:35.800 --> 01:57:43.320]  wayside. So like, when I was doing electrical work, you know, a lot of algebra, geometry,
[01:57:43.320 --> 01:57:49.880]  things like that came into play. I actually had a place to actually apply that. And then once you
[01:57:49.880 --> 01:57:53.800]  get like a passion for something, you're just, you know, always trying to gain that knowledge,
[01:57:54.600 --> 01:57:59.000]  move forward and like, learn everything you can about it, you know, so you can be the best
[01:57:59.720 --> 01:58:09.080]  at that that you can be. So, um, I really feel like what we do, like we learn all types of stuff,
[01:58:09.080 --> 01:58:14.760]  man. Like, I mean, it's like so many varied skill sets that you that you're learning, you know,
[01:58:14.760 --> 01:58:22.440]  microbials, biology, botany, electrical plumbing, instrumentation, like, you know,
[01:58:22.440 --> 01:58:29.800]  if you want to be the, be that dude or do that or whatever, you know, you gotta, you gotta really,
[01:58:29.800 --> 01:58:33.800]  you know, you gotta know a whole lot of different shit. Or, you know, it'd probably be like,
[01:58:34.440 --> 01:58:36.360]  figuring out how to fly to space or some shit.
[01:58:39.160 --> 01:58:40.600]  Did you finish the book, Duke?
[01:58:41.000 --> 01:58:48.120]  Yeah, yeah, it was pretty much all done. It's just, uh, spelling is not my strong suit. So,
[01:58:49.240 --> 01:58:55.960]  I have to, I have to get somebody to go through it and correct all the grammatical errors and,
[01:58:55.960 --> 01:59:01.400]  you know, just kind of edit it. And then I had like a bunch of pictures that I had drawn,
[01:59:01.400 --> 01:59:06.680]  I need to format and like add some charts, like I would need access to a computer to really make
[01:59:07.640 --> 01:59:12.760]  the charts and everything like that. Because like, I wanted like a reference manual in the back,
[01:59:12.760 --> 01:59:19.480]  you know, everything from conversion tables to, you know, about anything and everything a person
[01:59:19.480 --> 01:59:24.360]  would need to know. They can just like keep that book handy. And it's like, yeah, we got a question,
[01:59:24.360 --> 01:59:30.120]  you know, you can look to the back, your conversion, you know, look up a recipe or,
[01:59:30.120 --> 01:59:35.800]  you know, do whatever is kind of like, just like a little guide to success, you know,
[01:59:35.800 --> 01:59:38.360]  or at least like the way that I do it, you know.
[01:59:39.320 --> 01:59:43.320]  That would be awesome. That'd be a really valuable tool. I hope you continue on.
[01:59:45.160 --> 01:59:46.520]  And I hear you on the spelling, man.
[01:59:50.200 --> 01:59:55.400]  Yeah, dude, I spell exactly how I talk. And that is atrocious.
[02:00:00.050 --> 02:00:04.850]  Any plans to grow anything? Or are you going to just chill out until you get your water?
[02:00:05.250 --> 02:00:11.330]  Yeah, I definitely got to chill out a little bit, you know, until
[02:00:12.050 --> 02:00:19.170]  my little phase is done. And then after that, I'll jump back into doing that. And then also,
[02:00:19.810 --> 02:00:30.770]  you know, I had planned on doing a soil thing too. Soil nutrients, all that. And also starting
[02:00:30.850 --> 02:00:36.370]  up like a little podcast. Nothing as cool as you guys, of course, but just figure have little
[02:00:36.370 --> 02:00:43.410]  people on interview. Like, you know, I know so many different, interesting people from just so
[02:00:43.410 --> 02:00:48.690]  many different walks of life and everything. So this is going to be like all encompassing like
[02:00:48.690 --> 02:00:53.970]  any whole friends of mine or cool people that want to, you know, come on, talk about whatever
[02:00:54.450 --> 02:00:59.570]  could be about the weather, this type of stuff or whatever it is they do in life.
[02:01:01.570 --> 02:01:05.730]  It's really the old stories that you have and you the ones that you would probably
[02:01:05.730 --> 02:01:10.370]  choose to share and stuff. I feel like that's a lot of what's missed with some of this stuff.
[02:01:10.370 --> 02:01:17.010]  There's a lot of individuals that respect isn't the first thing that's given. And I feel like,
[02:01:17.010 --> 02:01:23.090]  especially since you been away, man, that is amplified for whatever reason lately. There's
[02:01:23.170 --> 02:01:28.690]  just there's all it is, is really hate, man. This just seems like if anybody is excited or
[02:01:28.690 --> 02:01:32.610]  anybody does anything good, there's a wave of people that for whatever reason don't like that.
[02:01:33.250 --> 02:01:36.930]  And I feel like that's why I've always been a huge proponent of your work. I know stickies
[02:01:38.050 --> 02:01:42.850]  riding with you on a variety of things is because there's so many. It's almost like you're a
[02:01:42.850 --> 02:01:46.850]  candidate, if you will. Right. You're a breeder that's out there doing the work. And it's somebody
[02:01:46.850 --> 02:01:51.410]  that other people want to see continue to survive, because without that, it's just going to be
[02:01:51.410 --> 02:01:55.570]  a bunch of hype genetics that people are going to be ripped off on when you're actually doing
[02:01:55.570 --> 02:02:00.770]  the work. And that's the other thing, man, with your packs and that kind of stuff, like
[02:02:00.770 --> 02:02:05.170]  very simple stuff. Most of it's black and white. Right. You let the genetics speak for itself
[02:02:05.170 --> 02:02:11.250]  on the back of the pack. You have your your kind of like grower notes. But at the same time,
[02:02:11.250 --> 02:02:15.650]  you'll say, like, hey, if you overfeed this, this could harm out on you. You're one of the
[02:02:15.650 --> 02:02:21.330]  very few people that I see will even say that kind of stuff, man. And that's just why I feel
[02:02:21.330 --> 02:02:27.410]  like this whole time and people have been excited to see you come back and to fruition is because
[02:02:27.410 --> 02:02:34.210]  those genetics are needed and that mindset is needed so that we can have quality, quality
[02:02:34.210 --> 02:02:39.410]  stuff that people want to, you know, basically sponsor in a way. Right. Like we want to
[02:02:40.850 --> 02:02:44.050]  be able to rock with individuals that are putting out really good genetics.
[02:02:45.010 --> 02:02:51.650]  Yeah, man, that's always the thing is like any anything that I was doing or getting,
[02:02:52.930 --> 02:02:57.810]  I was always trying to make sure that I'm supporting the right people, you know, people
[02:02:57.810 --> 02:03:03.730]  that were doing the right thing, not only like quality, you know, but they had like a good
[02:03:03.730 --> 02:03:08.610]  purpose and they were like, you know, good people at the end of the day. That way I could
[02:03:09.570 --> 02:03:15.330]  kind of feel good, you know, good about that. Like build a soil, for instance, you know,
[02:03:15.330 --> 02:03:21.490]  great people. Any chance I could, you know, anybody's going to ask me, where do I get this?
[02:03:21.490 --> 02:03:26.210]  Where I get that? I mean, shit, you probably get it to me in different places, but I get it from
[02:03:26.210 --> 02:03:31.810]  them because I want to support them. They're good. They're good people. Same with like Dragonfly.
[02:03:32.770 --> 02:03:40.850]  Same, same type deal. Yeah, they got his mattress, dude. That's my roommate, man.
[02:03:42.930 --> 02:03:46.930]  Yeah, I come through messing with people's mattresses. I ain't gonna call it a mattress.
[02:03:46.930 --> 02:03:54.210]  It's like a yoga mat on a piece of steel. Well, just quickly, and this is kind of the point I
[02:03:54.210 --> 02:03:59.650]  wanted to emphasize to you. You just mentioned good people. And I think while you weren't here,
[02:03:59.650 --> 02:04:08.290]  the common denominator of everybody who talked about you was that as a human being, you are
[02:04:08.290 --> 02:04:14.850]  truly a good human being. And obviously as a breeder, you are a truly fantastic breeder.
[02:04:14.850 --> 02:04:20.610]  But it was the human being part that, you know, everybody came together and cared about you and
[02:04:20.610 --> 02:04:30.690]  was concerned about you. And I thought that was, you know, you got one legacy and you can burn it.
[02:04:32.050 --> 02:04:41.410]  Your legacy is that you're a great human being. And I hope the experience didn't jade you because,
[02:04:41.970 --> 02:04:49.410]  which obviously, I mean, it probably did, but and it definitely can. But just know that a lot of
[02:04:49.410 --> 02:04:58.210]  people care about you and think the world of you as a human. Yeah, man. And I got to see a lot of
[02:04:59.170 --> 02:05:12.530]  that, you know, so widespread. And that really blew me away. I never like when I would do things
[02:05:12.530 --> 02:05:18.690]  for people, I wasn't doing it to be like, hey, look at me. I'm going to take a selfie and go all over
[02:05:18.690 --> 02:05:24.290]  the Internet. Oh, yeah. I hope this person do this or whatever. Like, you know, if I genuinely,
[02:05:24.290 --> 02:05:30.530]  you know, want to help somebody, I just help them. And I guess I've done a lot of that over
[02:05:30.530 --> 02:05:35.490]  the years. And, you know, I just don't really think twice about it. You know, I don't want nothing.
[02:05:36.450 --> 02:05:42.050]  I don't want nothing back. You know, I don't want anything back. I just want to help somebody.
[02:05:42.770 --> 02:05:49.010]  So I guess, you know, I just didn't really think about it or remember it. All these people coming
[02:05:49.010 --> 02:05:55.490]  out of the woodwork being like, 10 years ago, 15 years ago, last year, over the months or whatever,
[02:05:55.490 --> 02:06:00.850]  I did this. I did that. I was like, yeah, I mean, wow. And, you know, all these people came out of
[02:06:00.850 --> 02:06:06.930]  the woodwork. I'm like, yeah, you're a good person. I was like, man, you know, just, you know,
[02:06:06.930 --> 02:06:14.610]  who I am, who I try to be. I wish more people were like that, I guess. But, you know, you know,
[02:06:14.690 --> 02:06:22.130]  you know how it is. So, yeah, I mean, just the whole experience, like, you know, even if you're
[02:06:25.410 --> 02:06:33.650]  in like a really bad environment, a lot of hatred, violence, everything else,
[02:06:35.250 --> 02:06:40.770]  even within the confines of something like that, there's still a lot of love there.
[02:06:40.770 --> 02:06:46.690]  There's a lot of kindness. It might not be as much, but it's still there. You know, you still
[02:06:46.690 --> 02:06:58.370]  got people looking out for other people, you know. So you can still continue to be your best self,
[02:06:58.370 --> 02:07:04.530]  you know, given the situation, of course. But you can still do good things for people,
[02:07:04.610 --> 02:07:12.610]  even in a place like that. So, like, I would liken it to, like, you know,
[02:07:13.890 --> 02:07:19.490]  because it's weird, right? It's like, how do you even put that shit into words or,
[02:07:20.770 --> 02:07:28.930]  like, describe it? It's a really strange, weird thing that it's like, I don't know if people
[02:07:29.810 --> 02:07:33.090]  wouldn't be able to necessarily relate to, but I could equate it to, like,
[02:07:33.890 --> 02:07:41.890]  you got to be this rock, right? And your place as this rock, you're like in the front of the ocean,
[02:07:42.610 --> 02:07:48.850]  and you got waves just coming in, hitting you, unrelenting. It hits you, it covers you up,
[02:07:48.850 --> 02:07:54.690]  and then it drags past you, you know, on the way back out. And every time, it's going to take a
[02:07:54.690 --> 02:08:02.050]  little bit more, a little bit more, and try to erode you down and, you know, take you down to
[02:08:02.050 --> 02:08:09.490]  nothing. So, all you can really do is just kind of resist that and just be strong and try not to
[02:08:09.490 --> 02:08:15.090]  let it take too much away from you, you know. But the good thing for us, since we're not minerals
[02:08:15.090 --> 02:08:23.010]  or rocks, you know, we can get past that, and you can gain that back, you know, because it's a
[02:08:23.010 --> 02:08:32.130]  temporary place. And then once you're back, you know, you can adjust back and start to get back
[02:08:32.130 --> 02:08:38.290]  that, I don't know how to word it, man. It's like, you're kind of dead when you're in there.
[02:08:38.930 --> 02:08:42.530]  So, you know, you just kind of get the life put back into you.
[02:08:42.530 --> 02:08:47.410]  You got that spirit, man. You got that spirit back. You get that sunshine on your face.
[02:08:48.370 --> 02:08:50.530]  Remember what life is really about sometimes.
[02:08:51.170 --> 02:08:55.970]  Exactly. And, you know, you just got to be hard-headed, you know, at the end of the day,
[02:08:55.970 --> 02:08:58.770]  you know, you just can't, you can't let them bastards break you.
[02:09:01.870 --> 02:09:05.630]  Those are powerful words, my friend. Thank you. And I'm sure the audience is going to
[02:09:06.590 --> 02:09:10.270]  appreciate that as well, because we all go through fucking struggles, you know.
[02:09:10.270 --> 02:09:11.070]  Absolutely.
[02:09:12.430 --> 02:09:16.910]  That is a fucking hell of a struggle. Whereas, you know, we complain about our little fucking
[02:09:16.910 --> 02:09:21.390]  worlds, and maybe we ought to take a look in the mirror and say, hey, it could be so much
[02:09:21.390 --> 02:09:27.390]  fucking worse. Yeah. So thank you for those powerful words. And Peter, thank you for bringing
[02:09:27.390 --> 02:09:29.310]  that up, brother. Deep respect and love.
[02:09:30.270 --> 02:09:36.190]  And I wanted to hand the mic to Sticky. I know that he's somebody that is, talk about somebody
[02:09:36.190 --> 02:09:43.390]  that is always loyal, man, and discerns himself between people that are legit and individuals
[02:09:43.390 --> 02:09:49.950]  that you find out are fugazi motherfuckers. And I feel like, Sticky, as well as you are at figuring
[02:09:49.950 --> 02:09:54.350]  out what cannabis everybody's smoking, you seem like you're just as good at realizing who the real
[02:09:54.350 --> 02:09:57.070]  ones are. So I just wanted to give you that moment, dude.
[02:09:58.830 --> 02:10:04.350]  I appreciate it, Brian. I guess I get that from my mother. She's a really good judge of character.
[02:10:04.350 --> 02:10:12.830]  I'm not as good as she is. But I think if you, you know, if somebody shows you who they are,
[02:10:12.830 --> 02:10:17.550]  believe them. That's the best thing I can say. Because in this, in this industry,
[02:10:18.110 --> 02:10:22.270]  people are quick to show you who they are and then tell you that's not who they are.
[02:10:23.470 --> 02:10:27.790]  But, you know, there's a few people out there, like we say, that you meet and they'll tell you
[02:10:27.790 --> 02:10:31.550]  how that how it is, how it's going to be. And then they follow through with that. So
[02:10:32.430 --> 02:10:36.270]  that's what I try to align myself with. And Duke's always been one of those dudes.
[02:10:38.110 --> 02:10:44.710]  Ever since the Breed Bay days. Yeah, dude. Fucking Bonnaroo, bro.
[02:10:44.710 --> 02:10:52.790]  Yeah, really? Yeah. Yep. So yeah.
[02:10:54.470 --> 02:10:59.350]  So did you want to share any more of like your plans for the future? I know you mentioned like,
[02:11:00.390 --> 02:11:06.630]  like your soil and that kind of stuff. And I feel like if there's any, any time where all of us had,
[02:11:06.630 --> 02:11:10.310]  you know, this little platform here, I feel like it's time to give it to somebody. It would be you.
[02:11:10.310 --> 02:11:16.150]  So if, if you want to kind of just break down what you're after, if you want to, man, and plug
[02:11:16.150 --> 02:11:20.870]  away, dude, talk about your new Instagram, you know, all that shit. I feel like it's, it's well,
[02:11:21.590 --> 02:11:27.750]  well, the industry so that more people that have gotten into the cannabis industry in the last two
[02:11:27.750 --> 02:11:33.910]  years, find out about who you are, man. And kind of hopefully today research about what it takes
[02:11:33.910 --> 02:11:40.230]  to actually farm cannabis, where people respect what you're putting in, what the kind of work that
[02:11:40.230 --> 02:11:50.470]  you're putting out. As far as like, anybody, like if you're new to it, congratulations,
[02:11:50.470 --> 02:12:00.870]  you know, you'll never have anything better than your own. Never stop learning. The one thing I
[02:12:00.870 --> 02:12:07.510]  used to hate after legalization happened, but I used to keep hearing this term master, master
[02:12:07.510 --> 02:12:15.750]  grower. And I was like, can't master a fucking plant, dude. Like this is bullshit. So just accept
[02:12:15.750 --> 02:12:20.870]  like, you're never going to master that shit. I wouldn't even want to, you know, because that's
[02:12:20.870 --> 02:12:26.470]  what keeps it cool. You're always learning, you know, everything's always changing, you know,
[02:12:26.470 --> 02:12:32.710]  more and more science coming out behind stuff and you can keep learning. So number one thing being,
[02:12:32.710 --> 02:12:39.190]  you know, knowledge is power. And with that power, you know, you can do a lot of great things with it.
[02:12:40.710 --> 02:12:46.790]  It used to be a big medical movement. It kind of just got left to the wayside when legalization
[02:12:46.790 --> 02:12:52.310]  happened. So there's still like a lot of really sick, needy people out there. So if you get a
[02:12:52.310 --> 02:13:01.270]  chance to help somebody in that regard, absolutely do that. And just don't be like the first is like
[02:13:01.270 --> 02:13:07.510]  fight at something because there's a lot of, there's a lot of bullshit out there. So just be
[02:13:07.510 --> 02:13:14.630]  mindful of that and keep things simple. Simple has always worked best for me. The more I tried
[02:13:14.630 --> 02:13:23.990]  to complicate shit, the worse it would get. So doing that, man, it's such a big question, right?
[02:13:24.790 --> 02:13:33.830]  My brain's not used to working like this anymore. But let's see. Yeah, just, you know, just do your
[02:13:33.830 --> 02:13:42.150]  thing and enjoy, you know, and it's great because there's a lot of, you know, I mean, you can call
[02:13:42.230 --> 02:13:49.110]  them what you want. I mean, bad entities out there that don't want you to be able to grow
[02:13:49.110 --> 02:13:56.070]  at home. They're constantly fighting you behind the curtains every year. They got lobbyists and
[02:13:56.070 --> 02:14:02.230]  shit trying to make sure you can't grow at home. Trying to limit you and what you do because they
[02:14:02.230 --> 02:14:09.590]  feel like you're taking their money. So just make sure that, you know, keep your eyes open for shit
[02:14:09.590 --> 02:14:16.310]  like that because it's happening all the time. We lose more and more shit every single year. So,
[02:14:18.710 --> 02:14:26.790]  you know, keep your eyes open. And don't be afraid to speak up, you know, and there's a lot of people
[02:14:27.430 --> 02:14:31.350]  that are real sensitive and, you know, they don't like people that have an opinion
[02:14:31.350 --> 02:14:35.990]  about anything. But if you stay quiet, you know, these people will walk all over you,
[02:14:35.990 --> 02:14:41.350]  you know, so there's a point where, like, you got to throw all sensitivities and feelings aside and
[02:14:41.350 --> 02:14:46.150]  just tell them straight up, man, shut the fuck up. You're in the fucking wrong. You're trying to take
[02:14:46.150 --> 02:14:51.190]  shit from sick people and the normal people. You're dead ass wrong. And, you know, we're going to fight
[02:14:51.190 --> 02:14:57.670]  you for it. You know, simple as that. And you got to be used to people, you know, talking shit to
[02:14:57.670 --> 02:15:02.230]  you or whatever. I mean, that's going to happen. You're fucking with their money at that point.
[02:15:02.310 --> 02:15:08.710]  So whatever. But it ain't theirs anyway. It's it's here for all of us human beings, you know,
[02:15:08.710 --> 02:15:14.790]  it's not meant to be controlled by government or a company, you know, or some conglomerate,
[02:15:14.790 --> 02:15:20.470]  you know what I mean? So I'm a flat out fuck them people. You know, I've been saying that the whole
[02:15:20.470 --> 02:15:25.350]  time. It doesn't make me the most popular, but I ain't no fucking popularity contest. So
[02:15:26.710 --> 02:15:31.670]  I could give it really good two bucks what they think. So, you know, just remember, you know,
[02:15:31.670 --> 02:15:37.110]  there's a lot of dynamics going around what you do, but at the end of the day, just enjoy and
[02:15:38.390 --> 02:15:43.350]  keep learning and keep doing it. You know, it's a great thing that we can do what we do and you can,
[02:15:43.990 --> 02:15:49.430]  you know, do it as a job. There's so many cool things with it now. You know, times are
[02:15:49.990 --> 02:15:57.590]  times are changing. So. Just all good thing as far as my own personal work,
[02:15:57.990 --> 02:16:06.630]  I'm going to be slowed up for this year. Being able to do that. There were some good
[02:16:06.630 --> 02:16:11.110]  collaborations that I was working on before I had to go away. So.
[02:16:14.070 --> 02:16:18.310]  There's there's a way, you know what I mean? Because in these collabs,
[02:16:18.310 --> 02:16:24.070]  the work excuse me, the work had already been done on my end. So it's just a matter of them
[02:16:24.070 --> 02:16:30.630]  doing their end so that I can stay kind of hands off of it, you know, because I did my side of it.
[02:16:30.630 --> 02:16:37.510]  So, you know, that's totally doable. But as far as my own works, you know, it's you know, I got to
[02:16:38.070 --> 02:16:42.150]  get to get to be good. You know, everybody, all my friends like, hey, man, you got to
[02:16:42.790 --> 02:16:49.750]  you got to chill, dude. You get locked up. But I guess that just goes back to me being hardheaded.
[02:16:50.470 --> 02:16:54.470]  You know, I'm going to chill. I'm going to be good. I ain't going to go away no more.
[02:16:56.790 --> 02:17:01.110]  All these other projects are I mean, it's stuff I've been wanting to do, but that's definitely
[02:17:01.110 --> 02:17:07.990]  going to take take the time out. And, you know, especially with the YouTube how to's tutorials,
[02:17:09.190 --> 02:17:15.910]  a podcast, soil and nutrients book and stuff like that. I guess like having all that free time,
[02:17:15.910 --> 02:17:22.310]  it's going to open me up a lot more to I mean, I always used to answer all my DMs and talk to
[02:17:22.310 --> 02:17:30.390]  everybody, even with what little time I did have. So this way I can kind of give me to all my people
[02:17:30.390 --> 02:17:35.350]  that support me and people that need help. So like, you know, if you need to talk, I mean,
[02:17:35.350 --> 02:17:40.550]  should we have to be about this stuff? Like I'll put up a post probably in like a week,
[02:17:40.550 --> 02:17:45.110]  like I used to do every year. If you've got any friends or family, holidays are rough on you.
[02:17:45.190 --> 02:17:50.790]  And I know the feeling hit me up, you know, bullshit about whatever with, you know. So,
[02:17:51.510 --> 02:17:57.430]  you know, that way I can open myself up more to other people and talk about things, do some
[02:17:57.430 --> 02:18:03.830]  teaching, kind of pay that that part forward. And then when my waiting period's up, man,
[02:18:03.830 --> 02:18:13.910]  back like crack, fucking sound like Donkey Kong, dudes. Yeah. So, you know, that's in a nutshell.
[02:18:13.910 --> 02:18:18.470]  You know, that's that's all we're going to all we're going to be doing. I got my new
[02:18:18.470 --> 02:18:26.950]  Instagram. Lost the old one. The real Duke Diamond. I just hit it up. I'll be posting,
[02:18:26.950 --> 02:18:31.670]  you know, I normally go for some funny shit, some philosophical shit, some redneck shit,
[02:18:31.670 --> 02:18:39.270]  you know, and it's what I'll do during the day. I will say, man, from an Instagram point of view,
[02:18:39.270 --> 02:18:44.710]  you got that shit down to you can take very simple photos and like really get it where people
[02:18:45.590 --> 02:18:49.590]  understand and where at least maybe hopefully trying to understand more what you've been
[02:18:49.590 --> 02:18:55.190]  through with with your posts. So definitely follow him. If you scroll down, I like that
[02:18:55.190 --> 02:19:02.390]  time photo, that watch photo that you took, buddy. Yeah, I remember you came. You came visit
[02:19:02.390 --> 02:19:08.230]  me. I told you about that watch. That's a special watch. Yeah, I just like how you started off the
[02:19:08.230 --> 02:19:14.790]  comeback with that that photo, man. Pretty, pretty special. Yeah, man, that's the idea is like
[02:19:14.790 --> 02:19:21.350]  with this, you take everybody along for the whole journey. They can be along for every single step
[02:19:21.350 --> 02:19:28.550]  of it. And hopefully people enjoy it and get some entertainment out of it. Maybe learn something.
[02:19:28.550 --> 02:19:33.430]  Shit, man, who knows, like whatever they get out of it, it's something good. You know,
[02:19:33.430 --> 02:19:41.370]  I'm cool with that. So if you don't know our our guest while you were away, he's been winning the
[02:19:41.370 --> 02:19:48.490]  belts around town, dude. So, yeah, I would imagine in time he probably running your genetics. So it'd
[02:19:48.490 --> 02:19:55.690]  just be cool to see where you said it basically took him six years to go from the dream of farming
[02:19:55.690 --> 02:20:01.210]  cannabis to now he's in a facility literally as we talked to him that will eventually be 20,000
[02:20:01.290 --> 02:20:06.570]  square feet. So in six years to be able to achieve something like that, hats off to you, buddy.
[02:20:07.130 --> 02:20:13.610]  Yeah, big time. That's a lot of work to do. I already know, man. I know Sticky's seen it.
[02:20:14.410 --> 02:20:21.130]  Pretty sure Brian and seen it before what I used to do by myself. Yeah, people don't realize
[02:20:21.130 --> 02:20:26.490]  the end of the day, it's fucking farming. You're a farmer. And you ever talked to any farmer. It's not
[02:20:26.650 --> 02:20:32.570]  easy work, man. So hats off to you, dude. And best of luck with it, man. Don't let them grind you down.
[02:20:35.130 --> 02:20:41.930]  I appreciate that, man. I'm like a little shook that I'm even on the same show with you, honestly.
[02:20:43.850 --> 02:20:47.690]  Man, I ain't shit for real, dude.
[02:20:50.330 --> 02:20:50.970]  Yeah, I heard so much about you, man.
[02:20:50.970 --> 02:20:54.250]  He puts his pants on one leg at a time, just like the rest of us.
[02:20:54.890 --> 02:21:00.890]  Yeah, I'm actually a two-legged man. Actually, I get them out on the floor.
[02:21:01.450 --> 02:21:06.970]  I put my feet in and then I'm... Yeah, I try to find efficiency in everything. But I mean,
[02:21:06.970 --> 02:21:11.290]  that's my tip on, just sit down on the edge of the bed, put both feet on and then you can just
[02:21:11.290 --> 02:21:16.570]  slide them right up. I got to try that. Yeah, man, over the course of a lifetime, you might save a
[02:21:16.570 --> 02:21:25.690]  couple of minutes. More time with your plants. Exactly, man. Exactly.
[02:21:29.480 --> 02:21:37.960]  What do you have any more advice, man? I feel like I know that this episode will be watched
[02:21:37.960 --> 02:21:43.400]  pretty heavily here because you might feel a certain way, man. But I feel like when the
[02:21:44.200 --> 02:21:49.960]  consensus is a certain aspect about a human being, kind of like where Peter was getting at,
[02:21:50.600 --> 02:21:54.040]  it's the community that's going to kind of decide that shit for you, man. It's like,
[02:21:54.680 --> 02:21:59.320]  how people feel about you. That's not up to you, for you. And there's just something, man,
[02:21:59.320 --> 02:22:04.040]  that I feel like because you are so genuine, people are really ready to rock with you,
[02:22:04.040 --> 02:22:09.720]  myself included. And we're ready to see that comeback, man. So we'll sizzle here for a year
[02:22:09.720 --> 02:22:13.800]  or two, however long that shit takes. But just glad to see the sun shines on your face. And
[02:22:13.800 --> 02:22:17.480]  I know that you're going to be continuing moving forward and doing things your way,
[02:22:17.480 --> 02:22:23.400]  man, which I feel like is the right step for you. That's what the Irish cat told me before I left.
[02:22:23.400 --> 02:22:28.760]  He was like, yeah, may the sun shine on your face. The wind always be at your back. The devil
[02:22:28.760 --> 02:22:37.630]  will be sick at work on the day you die. Yeah, I've heard that proverb before, too.
[02:22:37.950 --> 02:22:46.910]  Yeah. Right. It's a good one. Yeah. I mean, I'm a good thing that you are just being for a couple
[02:22:46.910 --> 02:22:52.270]  years and just let everything fucking shake out, you know, and yeah, for sure. You know, before
[02:22:52.270 --> 02:22:58.910]  you die. And yeah, it's like it takes time with the whole breeding thing anyway. Like you see
[02:22:58.910 --> 02:23:05.150]  anybody just coming out of the woodwork and be like, hey, I'm going to do this thing. And then
[02:23:05.150 --> 02:23:10.670]  within six months, you got like something finished going out there. Right. That's a
[02:23:10.670 --> 02:23:17.790]  fucking red flag. You have not had nearly nearly enough time. So like I said, by the time I actually
[02:23:18.510 --> 02:23:27.150]  get back to doing my own 100 percent in-house, it takes a minute. It really, it really does.
[02:23:27.150 --> 02:23:33.870]  And nothing, nothing comes quick. And I'm not I'm not really a type of person to put things in a
[02:23:33.870 --> 02:23:40.590]  rush. It's got to be right the way I like it or else I'll throw it in the trash. And I'm not above
[02:23:40.590 --> 02:23:45.630]  just throwing the whole the whole project out. I might retry something, you know, that didn't quite
[02:23:45.630 --> 02:23:52.830]  work out, get it where I want it. If not, and 86, that shit, you know, we don't need that. So, yeah,
[02:23:52.830 --> 02:23:58.990]  I'm just going to take my time with it. And, you know, luckily I had some steps like say behind.
[02:23:59.070 --> 02:24:03.390]  So, you know, it's not like start from complete scratch, but I get to continue on
[02:24:03.390 --> 02:24:07.470]  certain things already had. So, you know, no line before it's time. Right.
[02:24:12.390 --> 02:24:16.470]  I guess the real beauty of it is, man, the world went to shit when you're away anyway. So if you
[02:24:16.470 --> 02:24:21.270]  had to go away for two years, that was probably the best fucking two years you could pick, man,
[02:24:21.270 --> 02:24:26.710]  because we didn't do shit anyway. That's what everything went digital. So you're going to be
[02:24:26.710 --> 02:24:32.230]  able to bounce back, have your podcast and just run with it, man, because it seems like almost
[02:24:32.230 --> 02:24:38.630]  the whole world now has moved to acceptance of more digital things. More people are watching
[02:24:38.630 --> 02:24:43.110]  YouTube now than like regular TV and that kind of stuff. And I think all that really kind of
[02:24:43.110 --> 02:24:48.150]  shifted right as covid kind of took over, which is cool to see, man. People shouldn't be just
[02:24:48.150 --> 02:24:53.990]  sitting there watching sitcoms all damn night. You know, educate yourself. Yeah. Get out there.
[02:24:53.990 --> 02:24:59.670]  You know, you know, live, live life, you know what I mean? And, you know, get around, you know,
[02:24:59.670 --> 02:25:05.990]  because like, yeah, people are like stuck in front of the box all day and they they might not be in
[02:25:05.990 --> 02:25:10.150]  prison prison, but they're like kind of building their own cage around them. You know, that's
[02:25:10.150 --> 02:25:16.710]  that's a fucking way to live. Not at all. So get out there and talk to people and learn new stuff.
[02:25:16.710 --> 02:25:21.910]  Perspective, you know, travel broadens the mind. And I believe like even if you're just traveling
[02:25:21.910 --> 02:25:27.190]  over the Internet, you know, new people from new places, different perspectives, different cultures.
[02:25:27.190 --> 02:25:32.150]  It's going to make you a better human being at the end of the day. You get different viewpoints
[02:25:32.150 --> 02:25:37.030]  on stuff, you know. So, yeah, people need to get out there for sure. You know.
[02:25:39.190 --> 02:25:43.430]  And just quickly on a totally different topic, Duran, people want to know,
[02:25:43.430 --> 02:25:48.070]  did you just go because you forgot to flip the fans back on? Did you just go flip the fans back on?
[02:25:48.470 --> 02:25:56.310]  No, but I was good. I should go do that. But I went to go start the feed on two of the four of the tables.
[02:25:57.830 --> 02:26:02.950]  Don't forget to cut the water off, man. Let me go. Yeah, let me go through the fans real quick.
[02:26:04.070 --> 02:26:06.070]  And what the audience got my back. That's a suck.
[02:26:10.150 --> 02:26:11.990]  Yeah, I made that trouble before.
[02:26:12.950 --> 02:26:16.710]  There are a lot of concerned people for the past 30 minutes.
[02:26:20.630 --> 02:26:26.790]  I feel like it's pretty rare to see somebody go from a dream to fruition in six years,
[02:26:27.510 --> 02:26:31.270]  especially in the cannabis industry at the commercial level, because it's really hard to get
[02:26:31.830 --> 02:26:37.190]  picked up, drafted, if you will, to be able to show your skill sets. And before you came on,
[02:26:37.190 --> 02:26:41.670]  Duke, we were kind of talking about, you know, the problem with that is that sometimes even if
[02:26:41.670 --> 02:26:46.470]  you get the opportunity, something goes wrong. You know, you're the quarterback, if you will.
[02:26:46.470 --> 02:26:50.790]  And so you're scrapped. And then it's really hard to maybe pick up, get picked up on another team.
[02:26:50.790 --> 02:26:55.030]  So there's just so many things and so many variables from experience that I feel like
[02:26:55.590 --> 02:27:00.230]  a farmer needs to have to be able to even have the confidence to kind of farm at the level
[02:27:00.950 --> 02:27:07.350]  that Duran's at is because it's really, it's really tough. If you if there's no way to fake
[02:27:07.350 --> 02:27:11.590]  it, I guess is the best way to say that. So you're running that shit. You have it dialed in. You're
[02:27:11.590 --> 02:27:17.510]  able to achieve that in six years. And it's just super cool to watch and see, man. Same thing with
[02:27:17.510 --> 02:27:22.310]  the guy we interviewed with King J. It seems like just the younger individuals, because they're able
[02:27:22.310 --> 02:27:27.350]  to watch videos and stuff, they're just miles ahead of where the older guards were at the,
[02:27:27.350 --> 02:27:33.670]  you know, early 20s kind of thing. Yeah, that's that's cool that you mentioned King J. I did a
[02:27:33.670 --> 02:27:39.270]  little collab with him also. He sent me some pollen and I chucked it on a few of the strains
[02:27:39.270 --> 02:27:44.550]  that I had. And nothing, nothing like you do. But, you know, a little project.
[02:27:47.030 --> 02:27:50.870]  Oh, yeah, there's a future on a lot of that stuff, too, man. He's somebody that
[02:27:50.870 --> 02:27:56.390]  is humble enough, but gets all the other aspects of it. More of a style.
[02:27:58.150 --> 02:28:02.310]  I got a question for y'all. Not really a question. I guess it's a question.
[02:28:03.110 --> 02:28:08.550]  But people used to ask me back when I'd have like jars up, like, it's so good.
[02:28:10.230 --> 02:28:16.470]  I was like, I'm a fuck up. I mean, you're fucked up. It's like, man, the more you the more you do,
[02:28:17.110 --> 02:28:20.870]  the more you're going to fuck up, like when you don't know what you're doing, like not every
[02:28:21.830 --> 02:28:28.070]  just experience at the end of the day. So like a student, six years, he's probably grown more
[02:28:28.070 --> 02:28:33.270]  and done more in six years. And a lot of dudes are doing half ass through 20 years or something
[02:28:33.270 --> 02:28:38.230]  like that. And the more like you fuck up and you mess up as long as you're learning,
[02:28:38.310 --> 02:28:44.230]  it puts you like years ahead, you know, and like with the next guy that's coming up and,
[02:28:44.230 --> 02:28:48.710]  you know, 10 years or whatever, 20 something year old dude watches him like, hey, man,
[02:28:49.350 --> 02:28:55.110]  what'd you do? And he can pass on that little bit to be like, yeah, well, you know, don't do this.
[02:28:55.110 --> 02:29:00.630]  Don't do that. And man, that's what puts our generations ahead. So instead of being like
[02:29:00.630 --> 02:29:04.150]  real greedy with the knowledge, you know, there's certain shit, of course, you know,
[02:29:04.150 --> 02:29:08.390]  we keep to ourselves, trade secrets, whatever. But the basic general consensus,
[02:29:09.030 --> 02:29:12.710]  you can help somebody along, they're going to get a lot further on instead of having to go through
[02:29:12.710 --> 02:29:17.590]  those same mistakes, tribulations and everything. And, you know, you can really advance our,
[02:29:18.230 --> 02:29:23.590]  you know, community as a whole, you know, about passing these experiences along. So,
[02:29:24.150 --> 02:29:28.790]  yeah, man, I can only imagine six years and run out of facility like that. You still learn
[02:29:28.790 --> 02:29:34.550]  something every day, but, you know, the more you get out there, the more shit you see,
[02:29:34.550 --> 02:29:36.630]  and the better off you're going to be at the end of the day.
[02:29:38.230 --> 02:29:43.830]  I think that's a really good point. And I think that is probably a good reason or a good,
[02:29:44.470 --> 02:29:49.430]  yeah, good way of how I got so far, I guess, in six years, because I immediately started
[02:29:49.430 --> 02:29:56.310]  working in the commercial industry. And from what I was learning on the podcast and different
[02:29:56.310 --> 02:30:01.110]  educations, you know, YouTube and stuff like that, what I was seeing in commercial facilities
[02:30:01.670 --> 02:30:10.550]  was almost all what not to do. So my first couple years, I mean, honestly, every facility I've
[02:30:10.550 --> 02:30:17.190]  learned the what not to do over what to do. And that's definitely helped me in my own home grow
[02:30:17.190 --> 02:30:21.030]  the craft side of already seen it happen in the commercial girl, you know?
[02:30:21.270 --> 02:30:28.790]  Big time, dude. I've seen some of the before I went away, people would get me to like,
[02:30:28.790 --> 02:30:35.110]  I can you come look at this or consult? Like, what would you do? Like, and like, you really
[02:30:35.110 --> 02:30:41.030]  want to hear? Yeah. I'm like, you need to tell this shit. Don't start over, man. This is so,
[02:30:41.030 --> 02:30:47.190]  so incredibly wrong. And it's like, the where are you doing your drawing and you're hearing,
[02:30:47.830 --> 02:30:51.910]  it's like you just put a million dollars into this shit. And you're just trying to dry in a
[02:30:51.910 --> 02:30:57.190]  fucking gorilla tent or the Walmart dehumidifier. And you're jarring shit up and just packing it
[02:30:57.190 --> 02:31:03.510]  away. This is right after you trim like, what are you doing? Like, you got you got to you guys got
[02:31:03.510 --> 02:31:08.230]  to stop you're ruining everything that you just worked so hard for. And some people were like,
[02:31:09.030 --> 02:31:13.590]  you know, I didn't think about it that way. I was like, yeah, like, your job didn't like
[02:31:13.590 --> 02:31:18.470]  stop the day that you chopped down the last little IG pic that you took to get people hyped
[02:31:18.470 --> 02:31:23.350]  up like somebody's gonna burn this shit. And if you're someone I'm fucking grass clippings and
[02:31:23.350 --> 02:31:29.670]  charcoal, you ain't gonna be around long. So, you know, just, just a little things, man, I just see
[02:31:29.670 --> 02:31:35.510]  so much wrong on these big, huge grows. And the problem was you get like these big investors,
[02:31:36.550 --> 02:31:42.390]  Chadwick and Bradwick and whoever the fuck and they got fucking sticky working for him. And he's
[02:31:42.390 --> 02:31:46.390]  like, hey, I'm trying to tell you something. Ain't trying to hear it. Oh, I got money. This
[02:31:46.390 --> 02:31:53.430]  is mine. We're gonna do it. How are you? Okay. You know, run a swag farm. That's cool. But yeah,
[02:31:53.430 --> 02:32:00.630]  man, it's just amazing. Just the utter fuckery that you would see out there, man. Like it was
[02:32:00.630 --> 02:32:07.910]  mind boggling. So I'm glad that you got to capitalize on all that shit that you saw, man,
[02:32:08.230 --> 02:32:12.150]  make shit right. Because at the end of the day, when you're putting your shit out there,
[02:32:12.790 --> 02:32:16.070]  every time people are going to realize the difference, you know, they're gonna be like,
[02:32:16.070 --> 02:32:20.630]  well, yeah, such and such has got this bubble, this sour, this, this, this and that. And you
[02:32:20.630 --> 02:32:26.390]  got the same shit too. Huh? Why is it that I can smell his weed? Why do I not have to put my nose
[02:32:26.390 --> 02:32:31.110]  in a jar? Why don't I have to squish a bud? I can open a jar and smell it from feet away.
[02:32:32.070 --> 02:32:36.550]  Interesting. Wow. When I smoke it, I actually taste the shit. Wow. I'm actually getting sun.
[02:32:36.550 --> 02:32:40.630]  There's white ash. Wow. These extracts are really, really fucking way better.
[02:32:41.670 --> 02:32:46.070]  Why is that? It's because you're putting in the work and then the love, putting in the quality.
[02:32:46.070 --> 02:32:51.030]  So I wish there were more people out there like that, because I mean, you all know,
[02:32:51.030 --> 02:32:55.430]  you don't know what's up with them stores, man. Go in there. It's like cardboard factoring,
[02:32:55.430 --> 02:33:01.910]  grass clipping sad. Well, the reality is Duke is a lot of farmers probably really do want to do
[02:33:01.910 --> 02:33:06.390]  that, but they've been getting burned the last few years by some of the breeders. So they want
[02:33:06.390 --> 02:33:11.910]  to put in the work. They don't have the resources or the industry knowledge yet to know that
[02:33:11.910 --> 02:33:17.830]  this certain style is bullshit while this style is not necessarily tried and true, but at least,
[02:33:17.830 --> 02:33:21.750]  you know, something that you could work with, experiment, Fino hunting, and kind of find for
[02:33:21.750 --> 02:33:28.950]  yourself. Yeah, exactly, man. And, you know, it's also good for people to get out there. Like,
[02:33:28.950 --> 02:33:33.910]  if there's something that you want that doesn't exist, take those next steps, make it yourself.
[02:33:33.910 --> 02:33:38.870]  You know, there's nothing wrong with, you know, getting out there and, you know, doing your own
[02:33:38.870 --> 02:33:43.270]  project. Nobody's saying you got to open up a seed bank or get into that business. I mean,
[02:33:44.070 --> 02:33:50.310]  the way I started was just preserving seeds for our family and then making things that I wanted
[02:33:50.310 --> 02:33:55.350]  because it didn't exist. And that's just, that's just how it all kicked off. And I did that for a
[02:33:55.350 --> 02:34:01.750]  long time before I ever sold a bean, you know? So that's great advice. I think I could have
[02:34:01.750 --> 02:34:06.630]  saved a lot of good varieties throughout the year had I just not been, you know, afraid to
[02:34:06.630 --> 02:34:12.390]  throw my own pollen around. Yeah, man. Yeah. And like, you'd be really surprised at what you get.
[02:34:12.390 --> 02:34:17.270]  And if you got just like a little bit of, a little bit of knowledge to go through with it,
[02:34:17.270 --> 02:34:21.270]  or even go through the experiences of it, you know, you're going to learn a whole other side
[02:34:21.270 --> 02:34:26.550]  of that, that whole aspect of things. And it's really, it's real rewarding. It's really interesting,
[02:34:27.190 --> 02:34:31.110]  you know, just to see, see what, what happens, you know, because it's pretty,
[02:34:31.110 --> 02:34:36.710]  it's pretty crazy, you know? And I will warn you though, it's addictive. So you get into doing it,
[02:34:36.710 --> 02:34:43.350]  man, you, you know, being a fucking bean head and, you know, you'd be, you'd be all about it.
[02:34:44.150 --> 02:34:54.380]  Yeah. Yeah. So be, be warned, you know? That was some good advice there. And, and, you know,
[02:34:54.380 --> 02:35:00.540]  I love the discussion of lessons. Like there's no mistakes, there's no fuck ups. It's just a
[02:35:00.540 --> 02:35:05.660]  lesson, man. And if you, if you learn from it, then you are going to rock ahead. If you didn't
[02:35:05.660 --> 02:35:11.980]  learn from it, then shame on you. Right? Yeah, exactly, man. Yeah. Life is, life is one big
[02:35:11.980 --> 02:35:17.660]  lesson, man. Every day. And if you're learning from mistakes and learning from successes,
[02:35:17.660 --> 02:35:22.300]  you know, learning from both of them, you know you're, you're going to be a better person at
[02:35:22.380 --> 02:35:27.420]  the end of the day and your endeavors and just in everyday life, you know, from simple shit,
[02:35:27.420 --> 02:35:35.580]  like putting your pants on to you know, running a business, communicating with people. I mean,
[02:35:35.580 --> 02:35:41.100]  just everything, you know, everything's a science in this world, you know? So why not be the best
[02:35:41.100 --> 02:35:46.460]  that we can be? Like get all of it, right? Even just being a good, good person, you know, it's
[02:35:46.460 --> 02:35:52.140]  not too much to ask, you know? Don't you find it funny though, but nobody seems to learn from
[02:35:52.140 --> 02:35:59.260]  their successes. They just don't. It's like, Oh, now I'm a good grower. Lucky motherfucker.
[02:36:00.940 --> 02:36:06.940]  And that's the thing is like not winning by half a stance. You know, that, that was a big one with
[02:36:06.940 --> 02:36:13.340]  me is like a lot of people have success through half a stance and then they don't know why, like,
[02:36:13.340 --> 02:36:17.900]  why did you, why did you succeed? And they're like, I don't know. You know what, like for me
[02:36:20.460 --> 02:36:30.460]  in the back in the day, I think it, uh, yeah, you're back out by your back buddy. Yeah. But
[02:36:30.460 --> 02:36:36.780]  my personal thing was back in the day, um, I got some organic cane sugar sub cool was like, yeah,
[02:36:36.780 --> 02:36:42.700]  bro. Like, you know, you know, he's teaching me about the Krebs cycle. This is like early 2000s.
[02:36:43.340 --> 02:36:47.420]  I was like, all right. You know, so I'm learning from a really, really, really good grower,
[02:36:47.420 --> 02:36:52.620]  especially for, for back then, you know, he was, he was the man and the dude was a friend of mine
[02:36:52.620 --> 02:36:57.020]  and, you know, taking time and explaining some shit to me. So I'm like, all right, I'll get this
[02:36:57.020 --> 02:37:01.900]  organic cane sugar. And of course, like, you know, it works, you know, my citric acid, blah, blah,
[02:37:01.900 --> 02:37:08.460]  blah, blah, blah. So as all growers do, nobody under does shit. Everybody overdoes everything
[02:37:08.460 --> 02:37:14.140]  too much, love too much, this too much that. And you know, I was no, no exception to that rule.
[02:37:14.780 --> 02:37:20.300]  I learned my lessons with it early on, but I made the happiest little mistake that I ever made
[02:37:21.180 --> 02:37:27.740]  what was far as growing. And I ended up beating this cane sugar like way late in the game,
[02:37:27.740 --> 02:37:34.620]  like way late. It was like, Hmm, it might've been like day 47 or something. And I noticed me and my
[02:37:34.620 --> 02:37:41.100]  shit yellowed the fuck out. And I was like, Whoa, Whoa, why is that? Why did that happen?
[02:37:41.740 --> 02:37:46.940]  You know, there's, there's, there's a method to it. So then I'm like, Oh yeah, well, I'm growing
[02:37:46.940 --> 02:37:52.700]  in soil and I got microbes, microbes like breaking down this, this, the soil, you know, hence pooping
[02:37:52.700 --> 02:38:01.740]  and feeding my plant. Folks like sugar too. It's easier food. This easier food. They're going to
[02:38:01.740 --> 02:38:05.740]  go for that. They're not going to continue breaking down everything in that soil. So I was
[02:38:05.740 --> 02:38:11.740]  like, well, holy shit. I'm not like blushing, you know, like somebody would, you know, on a hydro
[02:38:11.740 --> 02:38:19.900]  table and I'm creating the same effect. I'm ceasing to feed this plant, you know, more anything
[02:38:19.900 --> 02:38:25.660]  in PK micro macro nutrients, these bugs, these microbes are going straight to the sugar now.
[02:38:25.660 --> 02:38:30.940]  So I was like, okay. So now when I'm ready for a plant to start, you know, not flushing out,
[02:38:30.940 --> 02:38:34.940]  but finishing up shit, man, I'm just going to get some organic cane sugar. I'm not going to break
[02:38:34.940 --> 02:38:38.700]  it down. I'm just going to put it in the water and boom, I'm going to hit it a couple of times
[02:38:38.700 --> 02:38:45.900]  and get that perfect fade in organics every fucking time. And now I, now I know happy mistake.
[02:38:45.900 --> 02:38:52.380]  Now I know why now I can purposely do it, you know, and consistently do it and, you know,
[02:38:54.060 --> 02:38:59.100]  do very good with that. So yeah, knowledge, you know, thinking about why you succeed,
[02:38:59.100 --> 02:39:04.940]  why you fail, figuring out the, the why and the science behind it. Yeah. You're gonna,
[02:39:04.940 --> 02:39:11.110]  you're going to go, go far. Well, there's a gold fucking bar.
[02:39:14.630 --> 02:39:17.750]  Thank you for sharing that. Yeah. I've heard of the sugar flushes at the end
[02:39:18.310 --> 02:39:21.510]  and, um, and people have had great successes with it.
[02:39:23.510 --> 02:39:27.510]  Yeah. It works real good. Plus those, uh, these microbes really like it. So if you're not
[02:39:28.070 --> 02:39:32.310]  tossing your soil out, like I don't want to keep mine, those, uh, these microbes,
[02:39:32.310 --> 02:39:37.990]  they eat it up and I mean, they get the fucking like crazy and reproducing. It makes them real
[02:39:37.990 --> 02:39:42.150]  happy. So then once that sugar is gone and that plant's gone and you're putting the next plan in,
[02:39:42.150 --> 02:39:47.750]  man, they're, they're ready to roll for you. The army's all sugared up. I'll fire it up on Fanta.
[02:39:50.390 --> 02:39:55.830]  You, uh, do you grow cover crops in between runs or you just let your pots follow?
[02:39:56.790 --> 02:40:03.190]  Um, like if I was in like an outdoor environment, I would, um, inside I don't, but the one thing I
[02:40:03.190 --> 02:40:08.790]  do like to do is like when I strip my lower third or whatever, and I'm desolating, I'm then suck the
[02:40:08.790 --> 02:40:14.390]  leaf and I throw it on top and then I throw a little bit of calcium with it. And I kind of
[02:40:14.390 --> 02:40:19.990]  treat that as like the, not the cover crop, but you know, like my replenisher and, you know,
[02:40:20.870 --> 02:40:25.990]  about once a year, you know, they're like some top dressing on it, you know, and kind of replenish.
[02:40:28.070 --> 02:40:32.150]  And this is a question for both you, Durham and Duke. Do you guys ever do soil tests?
[02:40:36.710 --> 02:40:41.350]  Yeah. Like somebody convinced me, I was like, well, it's not broke, but you know,
[02:40:41.350 --> 02:40:47.510]  everything's still fine. But I just like to see this, you know, the curiosity of it, you know,
[02:40:47.590 --> 02:40:53.190]  what, what goes down, what goes up, you know, like I said, having some tangible, you know,
[02:40:53.190 --> 02:40:59.910]  number science behind it. So I had one done and excuse me, and I got to see what was going on
[02:40:59.910 --> 02:41:05.510]  within my own pots. And it's pretty, pretty cool to see what's being depleted and what's not, you
[02:41:05.510 --> 02:41:16.360]  know, that's something that I have not tested personally at all. Um, but that is something that
[02:41:16.360 --> 02:41:22.280]  I definitely would like to see how my pots are doing, especially for being so old, going on four
[02:41:22.280 --> 02:41:31.000]  years, I'd like to see what has happened, I guess, what's going on. Well, I found over the years that
[02:41:31.000 --> 02:41:38.440]  even even different cultivars will pull different things, or add some back to it. So it's really
[02:41:38.440 --> 02:41:45.480]  interesting that and you can also track data points like, okay, I know that over this many
[02:41:45.480 --> 02:41:52.520]  course of runs, this got depleted. So I'm going to add clam shell or crab shell meal or whatever,
[02:41:52.520 --> 02:42:00.680]  whatever it is, you know, to offset that nutrient loss, so that you are always sitting full plant
[02:42:01.480 --> 02:42:07.080]  because if it's not there, then that plant can express everything that it wants to. So that's
[02:42:07.080 --> 02:42:12.040]  that's why I always tell people I encourage it. I mean, like I know dragonfly, they don't need to
[02:42:12.040 --> 02:42:17.240]  test I mean, they're they're putting so much organic matter back into their outdoor systems
[02:42:17.240 --> 02:42:23.080]  every year in the fall and get a jump started in the spring. So in that in that situation,
[02:42:23.080 --> 02:42:28.680]  it's not as important, but indoor in pots, I think, and it's not testing. It's crazy.
[02:42:29.720 --> 02:42:36.840]  Yeah, it's definitely a good thing. And like the way I used to model my soil was like, you know,
[02:42:36.840 --> 02:42:43.560]  we can get the same nutrient from a variety of different places, right? Some of it's more
[02:42:43.560 --> 02:42:50.120]  instantly available. Some of it's a little slow releasing some of it's super slow releasing.
[02:42:50.120 --> 02:42:54.840]  So anytime I planned around making a soil mix, I used to have things that were a little faster
[02:42:54.840 --> 02:43:00.440]  releasing medium, and then some things that took like a hot minute to really break down. So I never
[02:43:00.440 --> 02:43:06.760]  really would deplete all the way out, you know, so I had things that were breaking down at multiple
[02:43:06.760 --> 02:43:11.880]  different levels in time. And then as far as like replenishing and everything, it was, you know,
[02:43:11.880 --> 02:43:18.120]  very little. But you're right, you know, certain things are just calcium monsters, you know, they
[02:43:18.120 --> 02:43:24.280]  really are. And certain things are magnesium monsters. So, you know, you know, all over the
[02:43:24.280 --> 02:43:30.360]  place. So like sticky nose, because I know he's worked on farms this whole life. You know, farmers,
[02:43:30.360 --> 02:43:34.440]  we used to rotate crops, man, where I got the tomatoes this year, I'm probably gonna have corn
[02:43:34.440 --> 02:43:39.080]  next year. You know, we're gonna have some sugar beets out in the fall, some rutabagas, stuff like
[02:43:39.080 --> 02:43:46.760]  that, turnips, let that shit break down out there, sweet potatoes, you know. So yeah, you know,
[02:43:46.760 --> 02:43:53.640]  you're, you know, everything's gonna take different things. But another thing that I evolved with
[02:43:53.640 --> 02:44:01.080]  over time was the old way of thinking was like, man, load your soil up with everything under the sun,
[02:44:01.080 --> 02:44:07.400]  put it all in there, you know, like alfalfa, kelp, man, put all this, this and that, just load it
[02:44:07.400 --> 02:44:12.840]  down. And I found like, at the end of the day, like, if you're just trying to add just water,
[02:44:13.560 --> 02:44:17.720]  like sure, by all means, like, you know, do your thing. Or if it's like an outdoor thing,
[02:44:17.720 --> 02:44:23.400]  where you're not really going to be going back and forth to it for whatever reason that might be,
[02:44:23.400 --> 02:44:29.160]  all right, cool. But for all intents and purposes, like how we do it now, you know, I'm a control
[02:44:29.160 --> 02:44:34.760]  freak, man, like, I want to control things. So I don't want, you know, a lot of alfalfa and kelp
[02:44:34.760 --> 02:44:42.680]  in my soil, you know, just continuing to be used past like day 21 in bloom, and fucking me up.
[02:44:42.680 --> 02:44:46.600]  So that's something that I stopped putting in my actual soil. That's something that I just
[02:44:46.600 --> 02:44:51.960]  supplement. So like, I can control that now. And certain other things that I was like,
[02:44:52.520 --> 02:44:57.480]  quit overloading on it, you know, and it's something that I can supplement later as I want,
[02:44:57.480 --> 02:45:01.960]  you know, it takes me a little more work, of course, but I always felt like I got a better
[02:45:02.520 --> 02:45:08.520]  product at the end of the cycle that way. Because like, you know, tricantinol, you know,
[02:45:08.520 --> 02:45:14.200]  and asphalium, no sodium, just sitting there being available in the bloom. You know, I just felt it
[02:45:14.200 --> 02:45:20.600]  like robbed from a lot of the terpenoids and flavonoids at the end and it kind of
[02:45:21.240 --> 02:45:24.840]  what my what my jam. So I started doing shit like that, too.
[02:45:28.400 --> 02:45:32.000]  I had like a breeder question for you. I noticed when I was farming your stuff.
[02:45:33.200 --> 02:45:37.360]  We always were going after we called him the Serena Williams, we needed the bulk stalky
[02:45:37.360 --> 02:45:43.360]  girls so that hopefully we could continue and grow the big stocks into flower. Is there something
[02:45:43.360 --> 02:45:49.280]  that you're doing that because your stuff when we had our rooms, there was a you could look down
[02:45:49.280 --> 02:45:55.680]  the row and you could easily discern which females we were running and those were yours.
[02:45:55.680 --> 02:45:59.920]  Is that just because I got lucky in that pack or is that something that you feel like you're
[02:46:01.200 --> 02:46:06.640]  consciously breeding for is just the overall seems to be with more vigor.
[02:46:07.200 --> 02:46:11.600]  Thank you, man. You want to say hi to all the people out here on your radio interview?
[02:46:12.160 --> 02:46:15.280]  Yeah, you want to say hi, man? Hey, say hi, OG.
[02:46:15.280 --> 02:46:16.480]  Hi, everybody.
[02:46:16.480 --> 02:46:17.760]  Hey, I know, sir.
[02:46:18.640 --> 02:46:21.520]  Yeah. Yeah, they're my roommates.
[02:46:22.720 --> 02:46:26.000]  Oh, yeah, he's cooking some reps. No, I'm good. Thank you, little buddy.
[02:46:28.800 --> 02:46:34.560]  So and what the fuck is this saying? Oh, oh, purposeful breeding. Yeah. So
[02:46:35.280 --> 02:46:42.480]  with vigor in mind is the right. Right. So you got like a list of things like your goals. Right.
[02:46:42.960 --> 02:46:47.680]  And, you know, there's going to be this huge checklist because who doesn't want a huge,
[02:46:47.680 --> 02:46:55.040]  strong plant that flowers quick, that isn't picky, that stinks like high hell,
[02:46:55.040 --> 02:47:00.560]  that tastes super good. It's the most potent thing on Earth. Naturally, that's what we all want.
[02:47:00.560 --> 02:47:06.880]  Right. During the process, though. I mean, that's all well and good, but it doesn't just
[02:47:06.880 --> 02:47:13.840]  happen like that. So as we're breeding along, we're trying to we're trying to take as many
[02:47:13.840 --> 02:47:20.480]  things off this this checklist as we can. So when I'm selecting my males along with my females.
[02:47:21.040 --> 02:47:25.280]  Yeah, I'm looking I'm looking for girth and structure when I'm flowering out my males,
[02:47:25.280 --> 02:47:30.400]  you know, like I'm going to flower these males out before I use them for a few reasons. But one,
[02:47:30.400 --> 02:47:35.200]  I want to see the floral clusters, you know, like I want to see how tight these male flowers are,
[02:47:35.280 --> 02:47:44.240]  how bulky they are. OK, and I'm trying to link, to put it simply, males that are going to carry
[02:47:45.280 --> 02:47:51.520]  as much of the female side of it that I want to try to see in the progeny and also any any
[02:47:51.520 --> 02:47:57.280]  improvements that I can possibly make, whether it's speeding up flower time, you know, structure,
[02:47:57.280 --> 02:48:03.360]  beefiness, stuff like that, as well as, you know, also keeping terpene profile, flavonoids,
[02:48:03.360 --> 02:48:09.520]  potency and all that stuff in mind, too. So it's like kind of a big effort. Like I'm going after
[02:48:09.520 --> 02:48:15.920]  my main set of things, but I'm trying to improve everything that I can with every step that we
[02:48:15.920 --> 02:48:24.080]  that we go along. So when I'm ultimately using a male, you know, that that process just to make
[02:48:24.080 --> 02:48:31.040]  that male might have been two, three years longer trying to get that part just right.
[02:48:31.040 --> 02:48:34.880]  And since I'm so familiar with all the parents and growing it out right when it does come time
[02:48:34.880 --> 02:48:40.400]  to make that selection for that male, I'm confident like, hey, this is going to definitely
[02:48:40.400 --> 02:48:44.880]  be passing along all these favorable things to these females. And then we grow them out and
[02:48:44.880 --> 02:48:50.880]  test them. And yeah, we see, you know, where, you know, all this comes through in the end, you know.
[02:48:50.880 --> 02:48:56.960]  So you're trying to do the best you can with what you got with every step of the way. And by the
[02:48:56.960 --> 02:49:02.480]  time you get to the end, you know, if you did pledge your cards right and you did the work,
[02:49:03.040 --> 02:49:08.000]  you're going to have something good at the end of it that's a result of all that good strong plants,
[02:49:08.720 --> 02:49:15.120]  you know, some powdery mildew resistant, pest resistant, all these other little things that
[02:49:16.000 --> 02:49:21.280]  might not necessarily have been the primary goal. But while you were there, little things that you
[02:49:21.280 --> 02:49:29.120]  may know or, you know, observe, they help in the end, you know. So by the time you're getting it
[02:49:29.120 --> 02:49:34.880]  and doing your thing, you know, you're, it's going to give you more chance to be successful.
[02:49:34.880 --> 02:49:40.240]  And then it's like, I can't, I can't be there. So you need, you know, all the chances you can
[02:49:40.240 --> 02:49:44.880]  get because you might be, you grown up, might be somebody that's tuned in right now, never grown
[02:49:44.880 --> 02:49:50.240]  a fucking plant in their life. It's helping to ensure their success, their happiness and not be
[02:49:50.240 --> 02:49:55.200]  deterred away from growing their own. Because at the end of the day, I just want people to be happy
[02:49:55.840 --> 02:49:59.280]  and have something good because it might be for their own sick needs or,
[02:50:01.120 --> 02:50:04.880]  or who knows, it doesn't matter what, you know, I want them, I want them happy at the end of the
[02:50:04.880 --> 02:50:10.320]  day. So that's another reason with the bulk in the soil is like that was the only X factors,
[02:50:10.320 --> 02:50:14.800]  people were talking to me, I can, you know, I've grown Hydro, I've grown about every way you can
[02:50:14.800 --> 02:50:20.880]  think. That's the only way I can really control and kind of guarantee something's like, all right,
[02:50:20.880 --> 02:50:25.520]  if your environment is meeting this criteria, and you're using the same soil that I'm going to use,
[02:50:25.520 --> 02:50:29.680]  and we're going by the same regimen, we should ultimately have the same result.
[02:50:29.680 --> 02:50:36.880]  And as a breeder and a seed maker and everything, that's what I want. I want consistency
[02:50:37.520 --> 02:50:42.560]  and, you know, set people to be happy. And I think ultimately, at the end of the day,
[02:50:42.560 --> 02:50:45.680]  that's going to be the best way to go about that, you know.
[02:50:49.340 --> 02:50:52.860]  I hope this show inspires people that have been waiting to maybe pull the trigger,
[02:50:53.420 --> 02:50:58.460]  or thinking about it over the winter to, to start farming for themselves, just so they can see like,
[02:50:58.460 --> 02:51:05.740]  all right, I can run genetics with from somebody that's tried and true. And then basically be like,
[02:51:05.740 --> 02:51:10.460]  Mr. Stoney Jacks over here put in the time and effort and within, I feel like that's a short
[02:51:10.460 --> 02:51:18.940]  amount of time to really change your life. Six years is just pretty cool, man. So pretty cool the
[02:51:18.940 --> 02:51:23.340]  way this whole show kind of panned out. And obviously, Peter, I appreciate the way that
[02:51:23.340 --> 02:51:31.020]  you set it up, man. Pretty cool conversations today. Yeah, it was badass for sure. And
[02:51:32.300 --> 02:51:37.660]  fun to get the tour of the facility and then getting Duke bombed in here was
[02:51:37.660 --> 02:51:42.540]  fucking amazing. Good to see you out, brother. Thanks, Peter.
[02:51:44.540 --> 02:51:50.460]  Thanks for jumping on Duke. I appreciate it. Man, thanks so much for having me on. And
[02:51:51.420 --> 02:51:56.540]  yeah, it's just really good seeing everybody. And thanks for all the wishes, like not just
[02:51:56.540 --> 02:52:02.140]  to y'all, but everybody's hitting me up and welcoming me back. And I'm still going through
[02:52:02.140 --> 02:52:08.380]  all the DMs. It was like over 2000 DMs. And I got to hit everyone back up. So
[02:52:09.660 --> 02:52:13.100]  yeah, just thanks so much for all the support over the last couple of years. And
[02:52:14.620 --> 02:52:19.740]  you know, just everything. Yeah, just thank y'all. And thanks for having me on. And anytime, man.
[02:52:19.740 --> 02:52:29.260]  I'm always around. And now back to our regular scheduled program. Take it easy, Duke.
[02:52:29.260 --> 02:52:34.380]  I was just going to say the love was so high that Instagram thought that you were a bot. So I feel
[02:52:34.380 --> 02:52:39.980]  like that's how else could you say it other than that, man? So many people hitting you up that
[02:52:39.980 --> 02:52:45.420]  they think you're cheating. Yeah, I know. Right. Yeah, that's exactly what it was, too. They
[02:52:45.420 --> 02:52:50.140]  thought I was a robot or something like that. I'm like, yeah, I mean, I'm a robotic sort of. I'm
[02:52:50.140 --> 02:52:57.180]  kind of awesome. But new accounts, new accounts in 2021 for Instagram don't usually have 4000
[02:52:57.180 --> 02:53:03.100]  followers in like a day or two unless they're already like Kim Kardashian. Yeah, I mean,
[02:53:03.100 --> 02:53:08.620]  that's very, very rare. So yeah. And again, man, I like the way that you were posting up. You know,
[02:53:08.620 --> 02:53:12.460]  there's a variety of ways that you probably could have taken that. I'm sure, you know,
[02:53:13.420 --> 02:53:16.860]  you've probably gone through every emotion with it with certain things, man. But the way that
[02:53:16.860 --> 02:53:22.460]  you approach it and the way you came back is just classic your style, man. You know, I mean, you
[02:53:23.180 --> 02:53:27.020]  made a couple of posts and you already get more likes than the whole industry on certain shit. So
[02:53:28.060 --> 02:53:31.420]  you know, you're just doing what you do, man. And that's why people rock with you.
[02:53:32.060 --> 02:53:38.460]  Yeah, man, the day that a pack of coffee to get more likes and some somebody showing off the
[02:53:38.460 --> 02:53:41.820]  latest and greatest hype thing, man, that's that's that's saying something.
[02:53:45.480 --> 02:53:48.360]  All right, Stiggy, I think you got to dip off as well. Right.
[02:53:50.120 --> 02:53:53.880]  Should we call it a day there? Because I got a whole lot of shit to do.
[02:53:54.520 --> 02:53:59.640]  Right on. Yeah. Like, you know, Durand, do you feel shortchanged that we
[02:54:00.760 --> 02:54:03.160]  took this conversation a completely different direction?
[02:54:03.800 --> 02:54:08.120]  No, I'm excited to be part of it. Like, I never even thought I'd be,
[02:54:08.120 --> 02:54:11.240]  like I said, up on a panel with these type of people.
[02:54:13.400 --> 02:54:18.440]  Durand, you earned it, man. Six years, you're at a level you deserve it.
[02:54:18.440 --> 02:54:23.400]  Yeah, I super appreciate you guys having me on the show. This is the first time I've done
[02:54:23.400 --> 02:54:30.760]  anything like this. Hopefully not the last. I really enjoy what you guys are doing and I hope
[02:54:30.760 --> 02:54:35.880]  more people keep tuning in and continue learning. That's a big thing in this industry. I think
[02:54:35.880 --> 02:54:40.840]  more people just need to keep keep sucking in that that education, you know.
[02:54:42.120 --> 02:54:42.680]  Never stop.
[02:54:45.000 --> 02:54:52.200]  And my only housekeeping is at 6 p.m. tonight. We got Hota Herbs Grow and Tell
[02:54:53.480 --> 02:54:57.800]  I believe Kelp is today's topic. Tonight's topic. 6 p.m. Pacific.
[02:54:59.560 --> 02:55:02.040]  Nice. All right.
[02:55:03.000 --> 02:55:05.960]  So with that, should we end the live stream?
[02:55:06.520 --> 02:55:08.440]  Yeah. See you guys next week.
[02:55:10.600 --> 02:55:11.240]  Thanks again.
