[00:00.000 --> 00:05.900]  the- the- the- the- the- the
[00:06.000 --> 00:08.240]  right now. What is up living
[00:08.240 --> 00:10.140]  still nerd sorry we are a
[00:10.140 --> 00:12.140]  little bit late here- I'll just
[00:12.140 --> 00:14.140]  be as transparent as I can-
[00:14.140 --> 00:16.180]  today's kids birthday he is on
[00:16.180 --> 00:18.220]  one today- he is that he's
[00:18.220 --> 00:20.280]  angry at Peter and myself- so
[00:20.280 --> 00:22.320]  he took his shovels in any left
[00:22.320 --> 00:24.320]  the playground. So behind the
[00:24.320 --> 00:25.820]  scenes I had to. Throw some
[00:25.820 --> 00:27.320]  hail Mary's like I normally do-
[00:27.320 --> 00:29.320]  and we were able to reach out to
[00:29.320 --> 00:31.420]  you guys- I'm sorry I'm not
[00:31.420 --> 00:33.420]  able to hear you. Mark of you
[00:33.420 --> 00:36.420]  could. Excuse me yeah- so we
[00:36.420 --> 00:38.420]  reached out to you know to
[00:38.420 --> 00:39.420]  London to try to make this
[00:39.420 --> 00:41.420]  happen- because out of respect
[00:41.420 --> 00:43.460]  for you guys- and again- you
[00:43.460 --> 00:44.460]  know can I don't I don't know
[00:44.460 --> 00:46.460]  what you're on buddy but- I
[00:46.460 --> 00:48.460]  hope that- today you kind of
[00:48.460 --> 00:49.500]  think things through man
[00:49.500 --> 00:51.500]  because that was. So out of
[00:51.500 --> 00:52.500]  pocket not a character for you.
[00:52.500 --> 00:54.500]  I don't know I don't even really
[00:54.500 --> 00:56.500]  know what to say. But we're
[00:56.500 --> 00:57.500]  gonna keep it moving positive
[00:57.720 --> 00:59.720]  and- you know back to back for
[00:59.720 --> 01:01.720]  reason because he gave up his
[01:01.720 --> 01:03.720]  spot to you know. Express what
[01:03.720 --> 01:05.720]  the community and ask for was
[01:05.720 --> 01:07.720]  kind of like a another hail Mary
[01:07.720 --> 01:09.720]  show. So again we're having
[01:09.720 --> 01:11.720]  Sheldon come back because- we're
[01:11.720 --> 01:13.720]  the bright minded individuals of
[01:13.720 --> 01:14.720]  the community especially after
[01:14.720 --> 01:15.720]  these last few years you guys
[01:15.720 --> 01:16.720]  see that the community is
[01:16.720 --> 01:17.720]  paramount that's the whole
[01:17.720 --> 01:18.740]  reason why I think a lot of
[01:18.740 --> 01:20.740]  these shows exist. Is because
[01:20.740 --> 01:22.740]  the community especially the old
[01:22.740 --> 01:23.740]  guards the older heads they see
[01:23.740 --> 01:25.740]  that they say being a road it.
[01:26.020 --> 01:28.020]  And so I think moving forward it
[01:28.020 --> 01:30.020]  has to be the younger
[01:30.020 --> 01:31.020]  individuals that kind of
[01:31.020 --> 01:33.020]  continue to carry that torch- so
[01:33.020 --> 01:35.020]  when you understand how to farm
[01:35.020 --> 01:37.020]  when you understand how to- grow
[01:37.020 --> 01:38.020]  your own food as well as
[01:38.020 --> 01:40.020]  cannabis. In my opinion you're
[01:40.020 --> 01:42.020]  just elevating yourself is like
[01:42.020 --> 01:44.040]  a another human being we're able
[01:44.040 --> 01:46.040]  to give out tips and people can
[01:46.040 --> 01:47.040]  see you're like living proof
[01:47.040 --> 01:49.040]  this stuff. And Sheldon has that
[01:49.040 --> 01:51.040]  in spades so we're able to kind
[01:51.040 --> 01:53.040]  of go again it's like a lot of a
[01:53.040 --> 01:55.040]  deeper conversation I know that
[01:55.040 --> 01:57.040]  we're gonna talk about a lot of
[01:57.040 --> 01:59.040]  things and kind of dive deeper
[01:59.040 --> 02:01.040]  into the- you know the nitty
[02:01.040 --> 02:03.080]  gritty again- you know we
[02:03.080 --> 02:05.080]  obviously had some shows that-
[02:05.080 --> 02:07.080]  you know they are what they are
[02:07.080 --> 02:08.080]  we put that information out
[02:08.080 --> 02:10.100]  there. But again education to
[02:10.100 --> 02:12.100]  the community is paramount and-
[02:12.100 --> 02:13.100]  I hope that you guys see that
[02:13.100 --> 02:15.100]  because even- anytime
[02:15.100 --> 02:16.100]  distractions are thrown in our
[02:16.100 --> 02:18.100]  way. I was gonna find a way to
[02:18.100 --> 02:20.100]  bring the show to you and we're
[02:20.100 --> 02:21.100]  always going to keep it free.
[02:21.100 --> 02:22.100]  And we're always going to make
[02:22.100 --> 02:24.100]  sure that we respect your time
[02:24.100 --> 02:26.100]  and your time. Marko. Yes sir
[02:26.100 --> 02:28.100]  yes thank you all for coming
[02:28.100 --> 02:30.100]  again living soul nerds- yeah
[02:30.100 --> 02:32.100]  man it's been a little bit of
[02:32.100 --> 02:34.100]  drama here lately you know what
[02:34.100 --> 02:36.100]  I was covering. All the cowboy
[02:36.100 --> 02:38.140]  cup stuff we did two shows on
[02:38.140 --> 02:40.140]  that. And hey man that's just
[02:40.140 --> 02:42.140]  us giving information sharing
[02:42.140 --> 02:44.120]  what we know what other people
[02:44.120 --> 02:46.120]  know about people to the forum
[02:46.120 --> 02:47.120]  to share you know kind of
[02:47.120 --> 02:49.120]  express. Their feelings on it
[02:49.120 --> 02:51.120]  and all that so we gave a lot of
[02:51.120 --> 02:52.120]  people an opportunity to do
[02:52.120 --> 02:53.120]  that we're done with that for
[02:53.140 --> 02:55.140]  the day thankfully- I'm excited
[02:55.140 --> 02:57.140]  about today Sheldon someone that
[02:57.140 --> 02:59.160]  I respect a lot doing all the
[02:59.160 --> 03:01.160]  good things of natural farming-
[03:01.160 --> 03:03.160]  tearing it up on IG showing his
[03:03.160 --> 03:05.160]  process and his results which is
[03:05.160 --> 03:07.160]  to me always key- so yeah with
[03:07.160 --> 03:09.160]  that said man I want to you
[03:09.160 --> 03:11.160]  know keep this thing positive I
[03:11.160 --> 03:13.160]  love to just talk about a little
[03:13.160 --> 03:15.160]  bit of you know just the
[03:15.160 --> 03:17.160]  goodness and natural farming- if
[03:17.160 --> 03:19.160]  you all haven't noticed I have
[03:19.160 --> 03:21.180]  been off IG I'm taking a little
[03:21.240 --> 03:23.240]  hiatus- and that's just to get
[03:23.240 --> 03:25.240]  shit done I'm working on some
[03:25.240 --> 03:27.240]  projects- you know I want to use
[03:27.240 --> 03:29.240]  my time wisely this winter days
[03:29.240 --> 03:31.240]  are short- so yeah definitely if
[03:31.240 --> 03:33.240]  you and if you got questions
[03:33.240 --> 03:35.240]  check out my man right here
[03:35.240 --> 03:37.260]  Sheldon. Because he's he's a
[03:37.260 --> 03:39.260]  great resource as well I know a
[03:39.260 --> 03:41.260]  lot of people like hitting me up
[03:41.260 --> 03:43.260]  but you guys got to spread that
[03:43.260 --> 03:45.260]  around we got to reach to these
[03:45.260 --> 03:47.260]  younger guys reach the new faces
[03:47.260 --> 03:49.260]  and people's doing good things.
[03:49.380 --> 03:51.380]  And thank you for coming Sheldon
[03:51.380 --> 03:53.380]  so we can talk about some of those
[03:53.380 --> 03:55.380]  good things you're doing brother.
[03:55.380 --> 03:57.380]  Yeah man thanks again guys for
[03:57.380 --> 03:59.380]  having me back on it's always good
[03:59.380 --> 04:01.380]  to talk about this stuff.
[04:01.380 --> 04:03.380]  Yeah I'm all for the positive vibes
[04:03.380 --> 04:05.380]  and you know kind of steering away
[04:05.380 --> 04:07.400]  from the drama for a second you
[04:07.400 --> 04:09.400]  know let's get in our little a
[04:09.400 --> 04:11.400]  little world where we can nerd out
[04:11.400 --> 04:13.400]  about you know soil and
[04:13.400 --> 04:15.400]  microorganisms and plants you know
[04:15.400 --> 04:17.400]  leave all that stuff aside let's
[04:17.540 --> 04:19.540]  get into the drama.
[04:19.540 --> 04:21.540]  Yeah I mean I think that's the
[04:21.540 --> 04:23.540]  thing that really matters at the
[04:23.540 --> 04:25.540]  end of the day you know.
[04:25.540 --> 04:27.540]  Exactly and I feel like you know
[04:27.540 --> 04:29.540]  even though we're not involved
[04:29.540 --> 04:31.540]  with the Cowboy Cup it leads to
[04:31.540 --> 04:33.540]  something that I've learned in my
[04:33.540 --> 04:35.540]  life when you get involved in
[04:35.540 --> 04:37.540]  and around drama that energy
[04:37.540 --> 04:39.540]  comes to you you know and I don't
[04:39.540 --> 04:41.540]  know what's what happened with
[04:41.540 --> 04:43.540]  Ken and all that and I got a lot
[04:43.540 --> 04:45.540]  of respect for Ken and I thought
[04:45.680 --> 04:47.680]  you know I'm gonna bring a little
[04:47.680 --> 04:49.680]  bit more positivity so hopefully
[04:49.680 --> 04:51.680]  you know just doing this show we
[04:51.680 --> 04:53.680]  can get on back on track and
[04:53.680 --> 04:55.680]  you know just stay on that on that
[04:55.680 --> 04:57.680]  positive vibe so yeah what you got
[04:57.680 --> 04:59.680]  Brian where you want to start this
[04:59.680 --> 05:01.680]  thing off man.
[05:01.680 --> 05:03.680]  Yeah I think more individuals need
[05:03.680 --> 05:05.680]  to kind of know Sheldon's
[05:05.680 --> 05:07.680]  background again we especially
[05:07.680 --> 05:09.680]  that kind of the end of this year
[05:09.680 --> 05:11.680]  we're highlighting a lot of the
[05:11.680 --> 05:13.680]  entrepreneurs because of this you
[05:13.820 --> 05:15.820]  know if you choose to go behind the
[05:15.820 --> 05:17.820]  curtain it's not even just all drama
[05:17.820 --> 05:19.820]  it's just some things are out of your
[05:19.820 --> 05:21.820]  control you know maybe
[05:21.820 --> 05:23.820]  board members or somebody see
[05:23.820 --> 05:25.820]  the way the company wants to go in a
[05:25.820 --> 05:27.820]  different direction your experience
[05:27.820 --> 05:29.820]  might tell you oh that's gonna be
[05:29.820 --> 05:31.820]  you know that's gonna be obviously
[05:31.820 --> 05:33.820]  it's gonna be a train wreck at some
[05:33.820 --> 05:35.820]  point and a lot of individuals
[05:35.820 --> 05:37.820]  especially when they first get into
[05:37.820 --> 05:39.820]  living soil or larger facilities or
[05:39.820 --> 05:41.820]  people that just have grand plans for
[05:41.960 --> 05:43.960]  the future.
[05:43.960 --> 05:45.960]  Yeah I think it's a great analogy of
[05:45.960 --> 05:47.960]  it's kind of like buying a high-end
[05:47.960 --> 05:49.960]  car if you will but not knowing how
[05:49.960 --> 05:51.960]  to drive a stick so a lot of the
[05:51.960 --> 05:53.960]  grinding of the gears and people
[05:53.960 --> 05:55.960]  getting pissed off because they're
[05:55.960 --> 05:57.960]  spending a lot of money and here you
[05:57.960 --> 05:59.960]  are fucking up the car when you
[05:59.960 --> 06:01.960]  don't have the skill set for that so
[06:01.960 --> 06:03.960]  what we like to highlight is kind of
[06:03.960 --> 06:05.960]  the small time individual we're
[06:05.960 --> 06:07.960]  definitely like trying to get where
[06:07.960 --> 06:09.960]  the home growers skill set is
[06:10.100 --> 06:12.100]  you know you're gonna be able to grow
[06:12.100 --> 06:14.100]  your own food you're gonna be able to
[06:14.100 --> 06:16.100]  improve the overall beauty of your
[06:16.100 --> 06:18.100]  house you know again shout out to
[06:18.100 --> 06:20.100]  Greg Gino Malcolmi I mean he's
[06:20.100 --> 06:22.100]  living and breathing it front yard
[06:22.100 --> 06:24.100]  backyard gorgeous in the summer
[06:24.100 --> 06:26.100]  you know I think that's what a lot of
[06:26.100 --> 06:28.100]  people aspire to be able to do
[06:28.100 --> 06:30.100]  and the skill sets that you
[06:30.100 --> 06:32.100]  gentlemen possess are what the
[06:32.100 --> 06:34.100]  community needs to understand so
[06:34.100 --> 06:36.100]  that they can achieve these same
[06:36.100 --> 06:38.100]  things for pennies on the dollar and
[06:38.240 --> 06:40.240]  the brass tacks of natural farming
[06:40.240 --> 06:42.240]  should be that we're all learning together
[06:42.240 --> 06:44.240]  and we're all learning so that the cost
[06:44.240 --> 06:46.240]  come down for the community as a whole
[06:46.240 --> 06:48.240]  and I think that's kind of
[06:48.240 --> 06:50.240]  been the backbone I thought for a few
[06:50.240 --> 06:52.240]  years maybe it's drifted a little bit
[06:52.240 --> 06:54.240]  but the core values that I remember
[06:54.240 --> 06:56.240]  of organic natural farming
[06:56.240 --> 06:58.240]  was that we're looking out for each other
[06:58.240 --> 07:00.240]  because especially back then everybody was
[07:00.240 --> 07:05.560]  against you
[07:05.560 --> 07:07.560]  yeah
[07:07.560 --> 07:09.560]  go ahead Joe
[07:09.700 --> 07:11.700]  I was just going to agree man
[07:11.700 --> 07:13.700]  alright so why don't we get
[07:13.700 --> 07:15.700]  into some specifics then
[07:15.700 --> 07:17.700]  like um you know give us
[07:17.700 --> 07:19.700]  your thoughts man so you know
[07:19.700 --> 07:21.700]  give me your philosophies on
[07:21.700 --> 07:23.700]  kind of like natural farming
[07:23.700 --> 07:25.700]  how would you get somebody started or
[07:25.700 --> 07:27.700]  what would you tell somebody to kind of
[07:27.700 --> 07:29.700]  hey man where do I start
[07:29.700 --> 07:31.700]  you know let's go down that rabbit hole I guess
[07:31.700 --> 07:33.700]  okay yeah
[07:33.700 --> 07:35.700]  usually
[07:35.700 --> 07:37.700]  a good place to start is just getting
[07:37.840 --> 07:39.840]  a um
[07:39.840 --> 07:41.840]  at least a basic understanding of the
[07:41.840 --> 07:43.840]  soil food web you know what
[07:43.840 --> 07:45.840]  why is it important what does it
[07:45.840 --> 07:47.840]  consist of what
[07:47.840 --> 07:49.840]  is it responsible for
[07:49.840 --> 07:51.840]  and once you you know are exposed
[07:51.840 --> 07:53.840]  to that knowledge
[07:53.840 --> 07:55.840]  that it's you know the other aspects
[07:55.840 --> 07:57.840]  of natural farming IMO
[07:57.840 --> 07:59.840]  come into play and it's like oh this makes perfect
[07:59.840 --> 08:01.840]  sense if the microbes are doing this
[08:01.840 --> 08:03.840]  and you know they're all different and they do different things
[08:03.840 --> 08:05.840]  and you know bringing in this
[08:05.980 --> 08:07.980]  it logically makes sense when you explain it
[08:07.980 --> 08:09.980]  to someone if they have that foundation
[08:09.980 --> 08:11.980]  you know if you
[08:11.980 --> 08:13.980]  you're talking to someone
[08:13.980 --> 08:15.980]  and they don't have any real
[08:15.980 --> 08:17.980]  knowledge of how soil
[08:17.980 --> 08:19.980]  works you know they're used to you know I'm
[08:19.980 --> 08:21.980]  buying my 10 10 10 or
[08:21.980 --> 08:23.980]  whatever it is and throwing it on the garden tilling it in
[08:23.980 --> 08:25.980]  every year and you know I'm growing stuff that's
[08:25.980 --> 08:27.980]  gardening
[08:27.980 --> 08:29.980]  you know you gotta start soft
[08:29.980 --> 08:31.980]  you know you gotta go in gently
[08:31.980 --> 08:33.980]  real basic stuff and that was a problem
[08:34.120 --> 08:36.120]  I had in the very beginning
[08:36.120 --> 08:38.120]  personally trying to get people
[08:38.120 --> 08:40.120]  interested
[08:40.120 --> 08:42.120]  trying to explain some of these concepts
[08:42.120 --> 08:44.120]  to people it's you get really
[08:44.120 --> 08:46.120]  excited right and a lot of the stuff
[08:46.120 --> 08:48.120]  you do it for so long that it just becomes
[08:48.120 --> 08:50.120]  you think it's common knowledge
[08:50.120 --> 08:52.120]  it's just second nature to you
[08:52.120 --> 08:54.120]  and putting yourself in their shoes is critical
[08:54.120 --> 08:56.120]  not everyone's in that position
[08:56.120 --> 08:58.120]  not everyone has these what you consider
[08:58.120 --> 09:00.120]  basic principles instilled in them
[09:00.120 --> 09:02.120]  so starting there you know
[09:02.260 --> 09:04.260]  finding out where they're at you know
[09:04.260 --> 09:06.260]  what their goals are is also another huge part
[09:06.260 --> 09:08.260]  of it you know you're not gonna tackle everything
[09:08.260 --> 09:10.260]  exactly the same way
[09:10.260 --> 09:12.260]  you might you know bombard
[09:12.260 --> 09:14.260]  someone with a bunch of information
[09:14.260 --> 09:16.260]  that you know is in one ear and out the other
[09:16.260 --> 09:18.260]  because it's not applicable to
[09:18.260 --> 09:20.260]  their situation
[09:20.260 --> 09:22.260]  you know
[09:22.260 --> 09:24.260]  at least from my standpoint with the knowledge that I have
[09:24.260 --> 09:26.260]  that's how I approach it now
[09:26.260 --> 09:28.260]  you know where are you at
[09:28.260 --> 09:30.260]  let me know what you know
[09:30.400 --> 09:32.400]  and hopefully I learned something from you in that process
[09:32.400 --> 09:34.400]  and then we'll get into you know
[09:34.400 --> 09:36.400]  how I might be able to help you
[09:36.400 --> 09:38.400]  well that's really to me
[09:38.400 --> 09:40.400]  how I would say like
[09:40.400 --> 09:42.400]  an effective teacher is
[09:42.400 --> 09:44.400]  right they kind of understand
[09:44.400 --> 09:46.400]  such a broad scope that they're going
[09:46.400 --> 09:48.400]  to hear from the student and then kind of
[09:48.400 --> 09:50.400]  tailor it and dumb it down at least at the beginning
[09:50.400 --> 09:52.400]  so that you know
[09:52.400 --> 09:54.400]  you can find success early
[09:54.400 --> 09:56.400]  and a lot of complex subjects I've found
[09:56.400 --> 09:58.400]  like you know I might be
[09:58.540 --> 10:00.540]  I might be on YouTube and I'm like yo this dude's a little too much for me
[10:00.540 --> 10:02.540]  so then you try to find somebody else that maybe
[10:02.540 --> 10:04.540]  isn't on that same level
[10:04.540 --> 10:06.540]  and then you can get to those videos
[10:06.540 --> 10:08.540]  and I think some of that stuff
[10:08.540 --> 10:10.540]  the community felt that way with natural farming
[10:10.540 --> 10:12.540]  like it seemed pretty complex
[10:12.540 --> 10:14.540]  there wasn't as many videos out there
[10:14.540 --> 10:16.540]  you know now you guys
[10:16.540 --> 10:18.540]  I mean you guys are putting out
[10:18.540 --> 10:20.540]  unbelievably quality
[10:20.540 --> 10:22.540]  on Instagram for free
[10:22.540 --> 10:24.540]  I mean a lot of
[10:24.540 --> 10:26.540]  garden centers and stuff don't even understand
[10:26.680 --> 10:28.680]  all of the stuff that you boys are putting out there
[10:28.680 --> 10:30.680]  and that's why today I think
[10:30.680 --> 10:32.680]  I would love to talk about the things that you've seen Sheldon
[10:32.680 --> 10:34.680]  that are the most effective
[10:34.680 --> 10:36.680]  because I know like when you first get into natural farming
[10:36.680 --> 10:38.680]  you can create labs
[10:38.680 --> 10:40.680]  and all of these kind of basic stuff but
[10:40.680 --> 10:42.680]  at the end of the day that's not really
[10:42.680 --> 10:44.680]  you know that's not as effective
[10:44.680 --> 10:46.680]  as I think maybe you think when you first get into it
[10:46.680 --> 10:48.680]  you can actually have problems with that if you over
[10:48.680 --> 10:50.680]  use it you know you'd be a moron with it
[10:50.680 --> 10:52.680]  so moving forward
[10:52.680 --> 10:54.680]  what do you think are the ones where you spend the time
[10:54.820 --> 10:56.820]  day in and day out or weekend week out
[10:56.820 --> 10:58.820]  where you're still willing to make all of the
[10:58.820 --> 11:00.820]  ferments or the things that are tried and true
[11:00.820 --> 11:02.820]  with your recipe and the way that you
[11:02.820 --> 11:04.820]  farm
[11:04.820 --> 11:06.820]  so let me
[11:06.820 --> 11:08.820]  make sure I'm understanding your question
[11:08.820 --> 11:10.820]  correctly are you asking what I think has the most
[11:10.820 --> 11:12.820]  impact as far as
[11:12.820 --> 11:14.820]  you know yeah like when you're spending your time
[11:14.820 --> 11:16.820]  not only if I'm brand new to this
[11:16.820 --> 11:18.820]  not only do I gotta learn how to do this
[11:18.820 --> 11:20.820]  then I'm probably going to
[11:20.820 --> 11:22.820]  you know execute more than likely
[11:22.960 --> 11:24.960]  maybe fail on a couple different things
[11:24.960 --> 11:26.960]  have success on a few other things go back
[11:26.960 --> 11:28.960]  reassess I mean that's a long process
[11:28.960 --> 11:30.960]  so what are some of the things that you've
[11:30.960 --> 11:32.960]  done with experience that you could
[11:32.960 --> 11:34.960]  pass on to the audience and be like hey this
[11:34.960 --> 11:36.960]  is a tried and true I would learn how to do this
[11:36.960 --> 11:38.960]  these are the bricks and sticks of the house
[11:40.960 --> 11:42.960]  the IMO process just start
[11:42.960 --> 11:44.960]  trying to do it
[11:44.960 --> 11:46.960]  you know get as much
[11:46.960 --> 11:48.960]  information on it as you can you know understand
[11:48.960 --> 11:50.960]  how what's going on there why
[11:51.100 --> 11:53.100]  you're doing the things you are you know from the right
[11:53.100 --> 11:55.100]  white rice and the box and try
[11:55.100 --> 11:57.100]  to put yourself in the perspective
[11:57.100 --> 11:59.100]  of a microbe that you're trying
[11:59.100 --> 12:01.100]  to collect right but getting
[12:01.100 --> 12:03.100]  familiar with that and just start doing it because
[12:03.100 --> 12:05.100]  at the end of the day we're gonna you're gonna be
[12:05.100 --> 12:07.100]  shooting for ultimate diversity anyway
[12:07.100 --> 12:09.100]  you know go ahead and start building
[12:09.100 --> 12:11.100]  up that library you know you're gonna experience
[12:11.100 --> 12:13.100]  failure you're gonna experience more failure
[12:13.100 --> 12:15.100]  than successes with that
[12:15.100 --> 12:17.100]  process it's you know the
[12:17.100 --> 12:19.100]  most daunting part of
[12:19.240 --> 12:21.240]  natural farming that system
[12:21.240 --> 12:23.240]  but it is the most crucial
[12:23.240 --> 12:25.240]  you know it's an arbitrary
[12:25.240 --> 12:27.240]  number but if you were to put one on it
[12:27.240 --> 12:29.240]  you know do they say that IMO is 80%
[12:29.240 --> 12:31.240]  of what KNF is
[12:31.240 --> 12:33.240]  because it is responsible for so
[12:33.240 --> 12:35.240]  much it's
[12:35.240 --> 12:37.240]  kind of the foundation of how
[12:37.240 --> 12:39.240]  all the other little pieces that we make
[12:39.240 --> 12:41.240]  really work you know
[12:41.240 --> 12:43.240]  you know they can work and do certain things on
[12:43.240 --> 12:45.240]  their own but when you have this
[12:45.240 --> 12:47.240]  this IMO and your soil
[12:47.380 --> 12:49.380]  and you know it's diverse and it's thriving at this point
[12:49.380 --> 12:51.380]  you're feeding it with all this other stuff
[12:51.380 --> 12:53.380]  icing on the cake
[12:53.380 --> 12:55.380]  is how it's referenced a lot
[12:55.380 --> 12:57.380]  but just
[12:57.380 --> 12:59.380]  getting that IMO in there
[12:59.380 --> 13:01.380]  start collecting it if you don't
[13:01.380 --> 13:03.380]  go to IMO 3 yet just get familiar
[13:03.380 --> 13:05.380]  with cooking the rice you'd be
[13:05.380 --> 13:07.380]  surprised how many people have never cooked rice
[13:07.380 --> 13:09.380]  in their life you know like I really
[13:09.380 --> 13:11.380]  had very little experience prior to KNF
[13:11.380 --> 13:13.380]  I grew up pretty bland
[13:13.380 --> 13:15.380]  food to be honest with you and
[13:15.520 --> 13:17.520]  we didn't do rice it was always you know
[13:17.520 --> 13:19.520]  Uncle Ben's in the microwave
[13:19.520 --> 13:21.520]  you know what I'm saying so that was a learning
[13:21.520 --> 13:23.520]  process for me you see you know
[13:23.520 --> 13:25.520]  the moisture levels the kinds of rice
[13:25.520 --> 13:27.520]  that you're using and then once you get
[13:27.520 --> 13:29.520]  that down it's like okay well now you're factoring
[13:29.520 --> 13:31.520]  in where do I live
[13:31.520 --> 13:33.520]  has it been raining for the last two weeks
[13:33.520 --> 13:35.520]  is it super hot and dry
[13:35.520 --> 13:37.520]  you know again putting yourself in a
[13:37.520 --> 13:39.520]  perspective of a microbe you want
[13:39.520 --> 13:41.520]  to create that habitat
[13:41.520 --> 13:43.520]  for what would be ideal in that
[13:43.660 --> 13:45.660]  situation that's a long rant but
[13:45.660 --> 13:47.660]  IMO
[13:47.660 --> 13:49.660]  that's the short answer
[13:49.660 --> 13:51.660]  yeah I can second that
[13:51.660 --> 13:53.660]  definitely IMO and
[13:53.660 --> 13:55.660]  just backing up real quick for the young folks
[13:55.660 --> 13:57.660]  or anybody that's just getting into
[13:57.660 --> 13:59.660]  I say young meaning just starting
[13:59.660 --> 14:01.660]  you can be an old man if you're just getting
[14:01.660 --> 14:03.660]  into something you're green you know what I mean so
[14:03.660 --> 14:05.660]  have an ethos you know
[14:05.660 --> 14:07.660]  and what that means is like if you're
[14:07.660 --> 14:09.660]  going to call yourself you know Marco
[14:09.660 --> 14:11.660]  Farms right
[14:11.800 --> 14:13.800]  you should have an ethos and that's something you can
[14:13.800 --> 14:15.800]  always fall back on for an example
[14:15.800 --> 14:17.800]  your ethos may be
[14:17.800 --> 14:19.800]  you know to grow the cleanest
[14:19.800 --> 14:21.800]  you know healthiest
[14:21.800 --> 14:23.800]  medicine in a sustainable
[14:23.800 --> 14:25.800]  way you know what I mean and what that
[14:25.800 --> 14:27.800]  does if you write that down
[14:27.800 --> 14:29.800]  then as you're doing processes
[14:29.800 --> 14:31.800]  throughout your farming
[14:31.800 --> 14:33.800]  you can always fall back on that like if I
[14:33.800 --> 14:35.800]  if you question whether or not you should do
[14:35.800 --> 14:37.800]  something look back at your ethos
[14:37.800 --> 14:39.800]  does it fit that and that's
[14:39.940 --> 14:41.940]  something that can kind of help keep you on track
[14:41.940 --> 14:43.940]  as you're starting this process
[14:45.940 --> 14:47.940]  that's a really good point
[14:47.940 --> 14:49.940]  taking notes
[14:49.940 --> 14:51.940]  that's something that
[14:51.940 --> 14:53.940]  I mean right off the bat
[14:53.940 --> 14:55.940]  like if I'm doing an in person class or something
[14:55.940 --> 14:57.940]  it's like before you even get there
[14:57.940 --> 14:59.940]  bring a notebook and a pen
[14:59.940 --> 15:01.940]  like that's mandatory
[15:01.940 --> 15:03.940]  for me that was a thing when I took
[15:03.940 --> 15:05.940]  Chris Trump's class and I was one of those people
[15:05.940 --> 15:07.940]  that was like I've got a phone
[15:08.080 --> 15:10.080]  you know like I'm going to record videos
[15:10.080 --> 15:12.080]  I'm going to type this in my notes you know whatever
[15:12.080 --> 15:14.080]  I'm that guy but then
[15:14.080 --> 15:16.080]  once the class started and you start
[15:16.080 --> 15:18.080]  taking this information it's like oh
[15:18.080 --> 15:20.080]  I realize now there's a lot of this stuff
[15:20.080 --> 15:22.080]  I'm going to have to go back and reference
[15:22.080 --> 15:24.080]  you cannot capture this in a video
[15:24.080 --> 15:26.080]  or you know take it in here
[15:26.080 --> 15:28.080]  and text it at the same time
[15:28.080 --> 15:30.080]  you know you're not going to be able to grasp it fully
[15:30.080 --> 15:32.080]  and I think that the notes are crucial
[15:32.080 --> 15:34.080]  so when you're learning when you're starting
[15:34.080 --> 15:36.080]  out like collecting IMO or making
[15:36.220 --> 15:38.220]  IMO 3 write down
[15:38.220 --> 15:40.220]  what you're doing you know the specifics
[15:40.220 --> 15:42.220]  how much water to rice did I use this time
[15:42.220 --> 15:44.220]  what were the conditions outside when I
[15:44.220 --> 15:46.220]  placed those boxes what were the results
[15:46.220 --> 15:48.220]  now you've got this
[15:48.220 --> 15:50.220]  log that you can go back and flip through
[15:50.220 --> 15:52.220]  that you can you know if you haven't
[15:52.220 --> 15:54.220]  you know completely intuitively dialed
[15:54.220 --> 15:56.220]  into just knowing how to go
[15:56.220 --> 15:58.220]  about it that day you've got stuff to reference
[15:58.220 --> 16:00.220]  and you're increasing
[16:00.220 --> 16:02.220]  your chances of
[16:02.220 --> 16:04.220]  success
[16:04.360 --> 16:06.360]  and then just one quick gold bar
[16:06.360 --> 16:08.360]  and that I'm going to call it a gold
[16:08.360 --> 16:10.360]  bar because it's helped so many people
[16:10.360 --> 16:12.360]  is instead of just
[16:12.360 --> 16:14.360]  going out with one box and waiting a week
[16:14.360 --> 16:16.360]  and hoping you get a good collection go ahead
[16:16.360 --> 16:18.360]  and set out you know 5 or 6 if you can
[16:18.360 --> 16:20.360]  you know cause
[16:20.360 --> 16:22.360]  you know if you only get one collection out of 6
[16:22.360 --> 16:24.360]  you've still got a good collection where as if
[16:24.360 --> 16:26.360]  you only set out one and it's a failure and you do
[16:26.360 --> 16:28.360]  that week after week after week you're never
[16:28.360 --> 16:30.360]  going to get anywhere and I see that holding a lot
[16:30.360 --> 16:32.360]  of people back so just go ahead
[16:32.500 --> 16:34.500]  and put in the effort up front to get your boxes prepared
[16:34.500 --> 16:36.500]  and set out multiple collections at one time
[16:36.500 --> 16:38.500]  Gold
[16:38.500 --> 16:40.500]  bars and I think a lot of individuals
[16:40.500 --> 16:42.500]  when they hear that then they're not going to be as
[16:42.500 --> 16:44.500]  discouraged you got to think of it more
[16:44.500 --> 16:46.500]  or I think it was Trump was saying
[16:46.500 --> 16:48.500]  you got to think of it more of like baseball stats
[16:48.500 --> 16:50.500]  like 2 out of 3
[16:50.500 --> 16:52.500]  or I'm sorry getting 2 out of 3
[16:52.500 --> 16:54.500]  out of the 10 or you know so
[16:54.500 --> 16:56.500]  that you're putting out there you know that
[16:56.500 --> 16:58.500]  those are still like big league numbers especially
[16:58.500 --> 17:00.500]  when you're first starting out so don't get so
[17:00.640 --> 17:02.640]  discouraged
[17:02.640 --> 17:04.640]  myself dude I'm going out
[17:04.640 --> 17:06.640]  there putting the boxes out there driving out
[17:06.640 --> 17:08.640]  there you know
[17:08.640 --> 17:10.640]  it does feel like a kick in the teeth man when you
[17:10.640 --> 17:12.640]  come back and it's really nothing of
[17:12.640 --> 17:14.640]  value but at the same time
[17:14.640 --> 17:16.640]  what you're teaching is to kind of just
[17:16.640 --> 17:18.640]  minimize this stuff so that individuals
[17:18.640 --> 17:20.640]  can realize that
[17:20.640 --> 17:22.640]  maybe I need to up my skill sets
[17:22.640 --> 17:24.640]  a little bit before I even venture out there
[17:24.640 --> 17:26.640]  to put these boxes because
[17:26.640 --> 17:28.640]  you do get gung ho you want to do everything
[17:28.780 --> 17:30.780]  especially if you dive into this you know the first
[17:30.780 --> 17:32.780]  couple of months man you want to become
[17:32.780 --> 17:34.780]  almost like a wizard with it
[17:34.780 --> 17:36.780]  seeing you boys you know you're pretty close
[17:36.780 --> 17:38.780]  to that and I think being brand
[17:38.780 --> 17:40.780]  new to these things
[17:40.780 --> 17:42.780]  it entices a lot of individuals
[17:42.780 --> 17:44.780]  to want to get into this because the long
[17:44.780 --> 17:46.780]  term you guys are showing each
[17:46.780 --> 17:48.780]  and every day that the success is
[17:48.780 --> 17:50.780]  real you know
[17:50.780 --> 17:52.780]  in the forums and that kind of stuff when there wasn't as much
[17:52.780 --> 17:54.780]  video a lot of the more
[17:54.780 --> 17:56.780]  regenerative styles that were being
[17:56.920 --> 17:58.920]  brought up just seemed foreign
[17:58.920 --> 18:00.920]  and again shout out to Mountain Organics
[18:00.920 --> 18:02.920]  Blue Bird he again was
[18:02.920 --> 18:04.920]  one of the first ones at least that I saw
[18:04.920 --> 18:06.920]  that was going out of his way to
[18:06.920 --> 18:08.920]  kind of show that on the forums back in the
[18:08.920 --> 18:10.920]  day and obviously
[18:10.920 --> 18:12.920]  you know Ian is
[18:12.920 --> 18:14.920]  well known in the industry so
[18:14.920 --> 18:16.920]  these small individuals have
[18:16.920 --> 18:18.920]  now you know
[18:18.920 --> 18:20.920]  created a wave and I think Sheldon
[18:20.920 --> 18:22.920]  and Marco you know
[18:22.920 --> 18:24.920]  you boys are doing that and I know
[18:25.060 --> 18:27.060]  you can't talk about it so I wanted to bring it up
[18:27.060 --> 18:29.060]  because I commend the fact that
[18:29.060 --> 18:31.060]  you're continuing to educate from the heart
[18:31.060 --> 18:33.060]  being genuine and then showing
[18:33.060 --> 18:35.060]  in real time like this is what we do
[18:35.060 --> 18:37.060]  and you boys are on point
[18:37.060 --> 18:39.060]  with that stuff and I think the community
[18:39.060 --> 18:41.060]  needs to find certain individuals to
[18:41.060 --> 18:43.060]  continue to rock with
[18:43.060 --> 18:45.060]  and realize that
[18:45.060 --> 18:47.060]  you know not everything has to cost a lot of money
[18:47.060 --> 18:49.060]  it's something of value
[18:49.060 --> 18:51.060]  you know sometimes people are spitting out stuff that is
[18:51.060 --> 18:53.060]  of high value for free
[18:53.200 --> 18:55.200]  and we as a community might not
[18:55.200 --> 18:57.200]  value it because we don't understand it yet
[18:57.200 --> 18:59.200]  of wow that guy just spit out shit
[18:59.200 --> 19:01.200]  that saved me six months of time
[19:01.200 --> 19:03.200]  figuring this stuff out
[19:03.200 --> 19:05.200]  well yeah Sheldon just
[19:05.200 --> 19:07.200]  saved you possibly weeks
[19:07.200 --> 19:09.200]  because if you only did one and you only
[19:09.200 --> 19:11.200]  can get out on a weekend to a
[19:11.200 --> 19:13.200]  nice forest or something then
[19:13.200 --> 19:15.200]  like you said if you're going back next
[19:15.200 --> 19:17.200]  week hope you get another one but if you go ahead and put
[19:17.200 --> 19:19.200]  five or six that first day
[19:19.200 --> 19:21.200]  you're gonna get a hit you know one of those
[19:21.340 --> 19:23.340]  you know I recommend
[19:23.340 --> 19:25.340]  also take a collection in your yard
[19:25.340 --> 19:27.340]  if you have a yard you know just
[19:27.340 --> 19:29.340]  a simple collection under a tree
[19:29.340 --> 19:31.340]  see what you get you know work on your timing
[19:31.340 --> 19:33.340]  you know what I mean stuff like that
[19:33.340 --> 19:35.340]  and save that collection
[19:35.340 --> 19:37.340]  too because that's still valuable
[19:37.340 --> 19:39.340]  you know microorganisms
[19:39.340 --> 19:41.340]  if you have a good collection
[19:41.340 --> 19:43.340]  so yeah and then just before
[19:43.340 --> 19:45.340]  you know anybody comes up with the
[19:45.340 --> 19:47.340]  well you don't collect anything in rice
[19:47.340 --> 19:49.340]  but the mold that's already in the rice
[19:49.480 --> 19:51.480]  well then I just bring up liquid IMO
[19:51.480 --> 19:53.480]  because that process is
[19:53.480 --> 19:55.480]  seeing spores
[19:55.480 --> 19:57.480]  seeing spores grow
[19:57.480 --> 19:59.480]  seeing spores split lengthen
[19:59.480 --> 20:01.480]  and turn into mycelium
[20:01.480 --> 20:03.480]  fungi
[20:03.480 --> 20:05.480]  and you see that under a microscope
[20:05.480 --> 20:07.480]  and there's no denying
[20:07.480 --> 20:09.480]  that that process is taking place
[20:09.480 --> 20:11.480]  so you know that's kind of where
[20:11.480 --> 20:13.480]  I listen I entertain that
[20:13.480 --> 20:15.480]  but I do believe in the rice
[20:15.480 --> 20:17.480]  I do believe microbiology is
[20:17.620 --> 20:19.620]  I've seen it with my own eyes
[20:19.620 --> 20:21.620]  and I think obviously we wouldn't even
[20:21.620 --> 20:23.620]  be going down this road if we didn't think
[20:23.620 --> 20:25.620]  it was a viable
[20:25.620 --> 20:27.620]  growing method you know what I mean
[20:27.620 --> 20:29.620]  yeah
[20:29.620 --> 20:31.620]  crucial points man
[20:31.620 --> 20:33.620]  the
[20:33.620 --> 20:35.620]  the rice
[20:35.620 --> 20:37.620]  thing that's a topic
[20:37.620 --> 20:39.620]  isn't it so
[20:39.620 --> 20:41.620]  I want to speak on that for just a second
[20:41.620 --> 20:43.620]  so we gotta
[20:43.620 --> 20:45.620]  understand right that our
[20:45.760 --> 20:47.760]  knowledge on the
[20:47.760 --> 20:49.760]  microbiology that covers our planet
[20:49.760 --> 20:51.760]  is so incredibly miniscule
[20:51.760 --> 20:53.760]  right we know about maybe
[20:53.760 --> 20:55.760]  1% and of those 1%
[20:55.760 --> 20:57.760]  we know just a small fraction
[20:57.760 --> 20:59.760]  what those organisms are capable
[20:59.760 --> 21:01.760]  of doing what their function is
[21:01.760 --> 21:03.760]  and in that instance
[21:03.760 --> 21:05.760]  we only know how they function
[21:05.760 --> 21:07.760]  in isolation most of the time right
[21:07.760 --> 21:09.760]  we've cultured it out of the wild
[21:09.760 --> 21:11.760]  and put it in a petri dish in a lab with
[21:11.760 --> 21:13.760]  you know perfect foods and there's no
[21:13.900 --> 21:15.900]  we don't know how these
[21:15.900 --> 21:17.900]  things work in conjunction with
[21:17.900 --> 21:19.900]  other organisms
[21:19.900 --> 21:21.900]  so take that into consideration
[21:21.900 --> 21:23.900]  when we talk about well you're not doing this
[21:23.900 --> 21:25.900]  or you are doing that none of us
[21:25.900 --> 21:27.900]  really know at the end of the day what the hell we're doing
[21:27.900 --> 21:29.900]  so you know don't come at me like that
[21:29.900 --> 21:31.900]  for one so but second of all
[21:31.900 --> 21:33.900]  we've gotta factor
[21:33.900 --> 21:35.900]  in horizontal gene transfer too
[21:35.900 --> 21:37.900]  right this is a new topic that's just
[21:37.900 --> 21:39.900]  you know blowing my mind lately
[21:39.900 --> 21:41.900]  but that's
[21:42.040 --> 21:44.040]  a crucial part of it now that I've thought back to some
[21:44.040 --> 21:46.040]  of the those things that were taught to me
[21:46.040 --> 21:48.040]  early on that just kind of went over
[21:48.040 --> 21:50.040]  my head because I wasn't experienced like
[21:50.040 --> 21:52.040]  oh oh oh
[21:52.040 --> 21:54.040]  you know it's like you start with
[21:54.040 --> 21:56.040]  this seed culture
[21:56.040 --> 21:58.040]  basically in IMO 1
[21:58.040 --> 22:00.040]  these are like the real base level micro organisms
[22:00.040 --> 22:02.040]  you're gonna get you know some fungal spores and such
[22:02.040 --> 22:04.040]  in there but it's not gonna be the
[22:04.040 --> 22:06.040]  diversity that's gonna eventually be in your
[22:06.040 --> 22:08.040]  IMO 4 right and then
[22:08.040 --> 22:10.040]  when you go through the process of
[22:10.180 --> 22:12.180]  IMO 3 and culturing those out and expanding
[22:12.180 --> 22:14.180]  you've got that horizontal gene transfer happening there
[22:14.180 --> 22:16.180]  things are mutating and expanding
[22:16.180 --> 22:18.180]  and diversifying in that process
[22:18.180 --> 22:20.180]  and then you bring in the native soil
[22:20.180 --> 22:22.180]  in IMO 4 and all of those organisms
[22:22.180 --> 22:24.180]  into the game and the same thing is happening
[22:24.180 --> 22:26.180]  this whole check and balance system's going on
[22:26.180 --> 22:28.180]  they're like
[22:28.180 --> 22:30.180]  what you started with in IMO 1 again
[22:30.180 --> 22:32.180]  is not ends up in IMO 4 it isn't
[22:32.180 --> 22:34.180]  a complete process that's
[22:34.180 --> 22:36.180]  why it is so suggested to go
[22:36.180 --> 22:38.180]  all the way to IMO 4
[22:38.320 --> 22:40.320]  like IMO 2 is valuable yeah you can
[22:40.320 --> 22:42.320]  dilute that in the water and get some benefit
[22:42.320 --> 22:44.320]  from it in your garden but
[22:44.320 --> 22:46.320]  it's minuscule and I mean
[22:46.320 --> 22:48.320]  minuscule compared to
[22:48.320 --> 22:50.320]  the power of IMO 4
[22:50.320 --> 22:52.320]  applied properly
[22:54.320 --> 22:56.320]  so to
[22:56.320 --> 22:58.320]  so I think some of the other you know
[22:58.320 --> 23:00.320]  both sides of this we always at least
[23:00.320 --> 23:02.320]  try if we understand
[23:02.320 --> 23:04.320]  some of the argument or
[23:04.320 --> 23:06.320]  at least maybe not argument or
[23:06.460 --> 23:08.460]  but the thought process was
[23:08.460 --> 23:10.460]  if people are so new to this that they could
[23:10.460 --> 23:12.460]  be going out there spending their time
[23:12.460 --> 23:14.460]  wasting their time because they're not
[23:14.460 --> 23:16.460]  creating the correct
[23:16.460 --> 23:18.460]  kind of microbes that
[23:18.460 --> 23:20.460]  they think are
[23:20.460 --> 23:22.460]  what you're after you know how
[23:22.460 --> 23:24.460]  sometimes you could go out there it might be white
[23:24.460 --> 23:26.460]  and fluffy other times it could be the rainbow
[23:26.460 --> 23:28.460]  some people have called that the rainbow of death
[23:28.460 --> 23:30.460]  some people still use that
[23:30.460 --> 23:32.460]  I mean there's a lot of obviously ways to continue
[23:32.460 --> 23:34.460]  to harness these kind of things
[23:34.600 --> 23:36.600]  that's the way I saw it too
[23:36.600 --> 23:38.600]  I think it was Luna and a few
[23:38.600 --> 23:40.600]  others were saying but if you're brand new to
[23:40.600 --> 23:42.600]  it what are you creating out
[23:42.600 --> 23:44.600]  there so I guess kind of
[23:44.600 --> 23:46.600]  what we're now I guess
[23:46.600 --> 23:48.600]  coming together from hearing what you're saying
[23:48.600 --> 23:50.600]  is that the skill sets need to
[23:50.600 --> 23:52.600]  be there but in your opinion
[23:52.600 --> 23:54.600]  and Marco's opinion
[23:54.600 --> 23:56.600]  the skill set is worth the end
[23:56.600 --> 23:58.600]  goal because the trophies are
[23:58.600 --> 24:00.600]  you know you guys are seeing those with your own
[24:00.600 --> 24:02.600]  eyes under the microscope
[24:02.740 --> 24:04.740]  yeah absolutely
[24:04.740 --> 24:06.740]  something else just real quick
[24:06.740 --> 24:08.740]  I want to talk about is
[24:08.740 --> 24:10.740]  it's tied into this but the experimentation
[24:10.740 --> 24:12.740]  process guys I get how exciting
[24:12.740 --> 24:14.740]  this is how we
[24:14.740 --> 24:16.740]  you know go into a situation
[24:16.740 --> 24:18.740]  and automatically just human nature
[24:18.740 --> 24:20.740]  want to apply what we already know
[24:20.740 --> 24:22.740]  and try to figure out how to do this new thing
[24:22.740 --> 24:24.740]  that we've learned better
[24:24.740 --> 24:26.740]  before we've ever done it
[24:26.740 --> 24:28.740]  you know and I see that setting people
[24:28.740 --> 24:30.740]  back so so much
[24:30.880 --> 24:32.880]  instead of coming at this
[24:32.880 --> 24:34.880]  with weapons and trying to shoot it down
[24:34.880 --> 24:36.880]  because you're so smart
[24:36.880 --> 24:38.880]  try it and then come
[24:38.880 --> 24:40.880]  talk to me about it when it doesn't work
[24:40.880 --> 24:42.880]  for you after you've done this you know
[24:42.880 --> 24:44.880]  by the book then we'll talk
[24:44.880 --> 24:46.880]  we'll figure out what went wrong we can have
[24:46.880 --> 24:48.880]  a discussion about it but
[24:48.880 --> 24:50.880]  there are a lot of people that shoot themselves in the foot
[24:50.880 --> 24:52.880]  right from the get go because they're so smart
[24:52.880 --> 24:54.880]  you know I've done
[24:54.880 --> 24:56.880]  experimentation over the years
[24:56.880 --> 24:58.880]  and it's like I've done that
[24:59.020 --> 25:01.020]  I started out that way I'm guilty
[25:01.020 --> 25:03.020]  my goodness I'm guilty of so many bad
[25:03.020 --> 25:05.020]  habits as far as you know this is
[25:05.020 --> 25:07.020]  concerned but
[25:07.020 --> 25:09.020]  what I've come to at the end of the day
[25:09.020 --> 25:11.020]  going through all that at the end of the
[25:11.020 --> 25:13.020]  day doing it the way that
[25:13.020 --> 25:15.020]  it is taught works
[25:15.020 --> 25:17.020]  better than anything
[25:17.020 --> 25:19.020]  I ever experimented with it came
[25:19.020 --> 25:21.020]  out better 100% of the time
[25:21.020 --> 25:23.020]  you know side by side trials
[25:23.020 --> 25:25.020]  it's like this you know this is
[25:25.020 --> 25:27.020]  obviously going to work better because of this and this
[25:27.160 --> 25:29.160]  can't explain it
[25:29.160 --> 25:31.160]  I cannot explain it I'll be honest
[25:31.160 --> 25:33.160]  with you but it's proven
[25:33.160 --> 25:35.160]  to me that at the end of the day there
[25:35.160 --> 25:37.160]  are very good reasons why these
[25:37.160 --> 25:39.160]  methods are
[25:39.160 --> 25:41.160]  you know put out there and taught the way that they are
[25:45.200 --> 25:47.200]  yeah definitely
[25:47.200 --> 25:49.200]  learn things the quote on quote
[25:49.200 --> 25:51.200]  correct way when you learn something
[25:51.200 --> 25:53.200]  new find someone that's doing it a proper
[25:53.200 --> 25:55.200]  way and learn it that way
[25:55.200 --> 25:57.200]  and then experiment like once
[25:57.340 --> 25:59.340]  I didn't experiment and start
[25:59.340 --> 26:01.340]  applying different things until really
[26:01.340 --> 26:03.340]  I let nature kind of tell me
[26:03.340 --> 26:05.340]  like I'm making IMO 3
[26:05.340 --> 26:07.340]  piles very hot
[26:07.340 --> 26:09.340]  middle of summer
[26:09.340 --> 26:11.340]  well black soldier fly colonized
[26:11.340 --> 26:13.340]  my pile I was like hmm interesting
[26:13.340 --> 26:15.340]  so I didn't fight that I kind of just let
[26:15.340 --> 26:17.340]  them now it's their pile
[26:17.340 --> 26:19.340]  that
[26:19.340 --> 26:21.340]  still was a valuable IMO 3
[26:21.340 --> 26:23.340]  now that showed me damn black soldier
[26:23.340 --> 26:25.340]  fly ran through it so hey that's another
[26:25.480 --> 26:27.480]  little option I have for adding
[26:27.480 --> 26:29.480]  you know biology and
[26:29.480 --> 26:31.480]  nutrient cycling to my soil
[26:31.480 --> 26:33.480]  you know the main thing
[26:33.480 --> 26:35.480]  we're doing this for is people gotta remember
[26:35.480 --> 26:37.480]  you're building all this IMO
[26:37.480 --> 26:39.480]  so your soil will cycle nutrients
[26:39.480 --> 26:41.480]  and you want that soil to
[26:41.480 --> 26:43.480]  cycle those nutrients for the benefit
[26:43.480 --> 26:45.480]  of your plants you know what I mean so ultimately
[26:45.480 --> 26:47.480]  your plants are gonna tell you these things
[26:47.480 --> 26:49.480]  work you know what I mean
[26:49.480 --> 26:51.480]  so yeah definitely I like that great
[26:51.480 --> 26:53.480]  great point with that Sheldon like
[26:53.620 --> 26:55.620]  find a good source learn it
[26:55.620 --> 26:57.620]  properly then experiment is the way
[26:57.620 --> 26:59.620]  I've always found you know that seems
[26:59.620 --> 27:01.620]  to work for me I do see a lot of people
[27:01.620 --> 27:03.620]  that just jump right up and
[27:03.620 --> 27:05.620]  and actually
[27:05.620 --> 27:07.620]  show the show what they're doing
[27:07.620 --> 27:09.620]  but almost in a teaching way
[27:09.620 --> 27:11.620]  when it's their first time doing this
[27:11.620 --> 27:13.620]  process and that's a little bit kind of
[27:13.620 --> 27:15.620]  you know like alright well you're kind of teaching
[27:15.620 --> 27:17.620]  masses this and you're
[27:17.620 --> 27:19.620]  learning and you haven't even run it all the way
[27:19.620 --> 27:21.620]  through so you know things like that but
[27:21.760 --> 27:23.760]  you know hey man to each their own
[27:23.760 --> 27:25.760]  you know to me building soil
[27:25.760 --> 27:27.760]  is also key with natural farming
[27:27.760 --> 27:29.760]  you gotta have a good soil
[27:29.760 --> 27:31.760]  we're collecting all these IMO like I said
[27:31.760 --> 27:33.760]  the soil
[27:33.760 --> 27:35.760]  that's the stomach for your plants so we want
[27:35.760 --> 27:37.760]  that high rate of nutrient cycling
[27:37.760 --> 27:39.760]  and to have all that when we add that IMO
[27:39.760 --> 27:41.760]  you gotta be feeding them so that's kind of where the whole
[27:41.760 --> 27:43.760]  process comes in
[27:43.760 --> 27:45.760]  but yeah great points man
[27:45.760 --> 27:47.760]  just keep in the back of your mind
[27:47.760 --> 27:49.760]  if you're changing something
[27:49.900 --> 27:51.900]  you know experimenting
[27:51.900 --> 27:53.900]  make sure you have something to compare to
[27:53.900 --> 27:55.900]  you know don't do something for the first time
[27:55.900 --> 27:57.900]  and say oh it worked
[27:57.900 --> 27:59.900]  because you see you know fungus growing in your
[27:59.900 --> 28:01.900]  soil or what have you you know that's a visual
[28:01.900 --> 28:03.900]  indicator but how can you say
[28:03.900 --> 28:05.900]  for sure if it's working better or as
[28:05.900 --> 28:07.900]  good or if it's even doing period
[28:07.900 --> 28:09.900]  what it's intended to
[28:09.900 --> 28:11.900]  do you know do it
[28:11.900 --> 28:13.900]  the way that someone has taught you
[28:13.900 --> 28:15.900]  do your own thing on the side if you want to
[28:15.900 --> 28:17.900]  while you're learning that's fine you know the power
[28:18.040 --> 28:20.040]  of natural farming comes from observation
[28:20.040 --> 28:22.040]  right at the end of the day
[28:22.040 --> 28:24.040]  it comes down to observation and getting back
[28:24.040 --> 28:26.040]  to those intuitive senses
[28:26.040 --> 28:28.040]  using our olfactory right
[28:28.040 --> 28:30.040]  sight taste smell
[28:30.040 --> 28:32.040]  so definitely get involved in that
[28:32.040 --> 28:34.040]  but have something to compare to
[28:36.040 --> 28:38.040]  what do you boys think like
[28:38.040 --> 28:40.040]  again if I'm brand new to this
[28:40.040 --> 28:42.040]  I'm trying to figure things out
[28:42.040 --> 28:44.040]  maybe just kind of going out getting some
[28:44.040 --> 28:46.040]  you know some duff
[28:46.180 --> 28:48.180]  some duff from the woods
[28:48.180 --> 28:50.180]  bringing that back playing around with that
[28:50.180 --> 28:52.180]  because I would imagine you're going to see that
[28:52.180 --> 28:54.180]  maybe put it in your worm bin or something
[28:54.180 --> 28:56.180]  that's kind of how I've always
[28:56.180 --> 28:58.180]  tried to take that approach is I know you're not
[28:58.180 --> 29:00.180]  going to mess with your garden I know probably
[29:00.180 --> 29:02.180]  you believe 50% of you know what's
[29:02.180 --> 29:04.180]  being said here so let's just try it
[29:04.180 --> 29:06.180]  on your worm bin corner and start to see
[29:06.180 --> 29:08.180]  it for yourself and when people start to see
[29:08.180 --> 29:10.180]  that there's actually life in that or there's ways
[29:10.180 --> 29:12.180]  to improve on you know fungus net issues
[29:12.180 --> 29:14.180]  by using mother nature to combat
[29:14.320 --> 29:16.320]  that's when I
[29:16.320 --> 29:18.320]  if somebody's kind of like on board with it
[29:18.320 --> 29:20.320]  it is kind of when that curtain opens up
[29:20.320 --> 29:22.320]  for them in that moment so more
[29:22.320 --> 29:24.320]  individuals are hesitant on natural farming
[29:24.320 --> 29:26.320]  I think trying IMO or throwing
[29:26.320 --> 29:28.320]  stuff into your worm bin
[29:28.320 --> 29:30.320]  leaf litter those kind of things to start to see
[29:30.320 --> 29:32.320]  where that mycelium can start
[29:32.320 --> 29:34.320]  to take hold and when you can see
[29:34.320 --> 29:36.320]  it with the naked eye or you have a fruiting body
[29:36.320 --> 29:38.320]  again I think
[29:38.320 --> 29:40.320]  that's where you start to see for yourself that
[29:40.320 --> 29:42.320]  wow this can really be achieved and
[29:42.460 --> 29:44.460]  maybe I do need to
[29:44.460 --> 29:46.460]  next flip maybe do two or three plants
[29:46.460 --> 29:48.460]  and then go from there so I know
[29:48.460 --> 29:50.460]  that nobody's going to change overnight but to
[29:50.460 --> 29:52.460]  start their little corners and that kind of stuff for
[29:52.460 --> 29:54.460]  2023 I hope that
[29:54.460 --> 29:56.460]  you guys feel a little more confident this year
[29:56.460 --> 29:58.460]  to kind of do that and
[29:58.460 --> 30:00.460]  I hope that you guys you know reach out to us
[30:00.460 --> 30:02.460]  and come back because feedback
[30:02.460 --> 30:04.460]  is always paramount when someone's new
[30:04.460 --> 30:06.460]  to this and the entire community seems
[30:06.460 --> 30:08.460]  a little lost with natural farming
[30:08.460 --> 30:10.460]  Absolutely
[30:10.600 --> 30:12.600]  I just wanted to step back
[30:12.600 --> 30:14.600]  for just a second because you asked me where I'd recommend
[30:14.600 --> 30:16.600]  starting and you mentioned it's cold right now
[30:16.600 --> 30:18.600]  getting ready for next year great
[30:18.600 --> 30:20.600]  point now is the perfect time to get
[30:20.600 --> 30:22.600]  started on your FAA and OHN
[30:22.600 --> 30:24.600]  right those two inputs take the longest
[30:24.600 --> 30:26.600]  to complete and OHN
[30:26.600 --> 30:28.600]  is used in essentially every
[30:28.600 --> 30:30.600]  KNF preparation there is
[30:30.600 --> 30:32.600]  all the different you know feed solutions and everything
[30:32.600 --> 30:34.600]  you're going to need it go ahead
[30:34.600 --> 30:36.600]  and get it started that way by the time spring rolls around
[30:36.600 --> 30:38.600]  and you got stuff you know ready to plant
[30:38.740 --> 30:40.740]  you need to get IMO piles made and such
[30:40.740 --> 30:42.740]  you got it ready to go you know
[30:42.740 --> 30:44.740]  because it's almost a 3 month process start to finish
[30:44.740 --> 30:46.740]  to the OHN alone
[30:46.740 --> 30:48.740]  FAA that's a year you know
[30:48.740 --> 30:50.740]  to be complete so
[30:50.740 --> 30:52.740]  go ahead and get that started ASAP
[30:52.740 --> 30:54.740]  you know while you're getting into
[30:54.740 --> 30:56.740]  the IMO thing too that's a learning process
[30:56.740 --> 30:58.740]  but things you can do right from the get go
[30:58.740 --> 31:00.740]  OHN and
[31:00.740 --> 31:02.740]  fish amino acids
[31:02.740 --> 31:04.740]  and Brian
[31:04.740 --> 31:06.740]  along your same lines
[31:06.880 --> 31:08.880]  I tell people all the time
[31:08.880 --> 31:10.880]  grab some stuff out the forest
[31:10.880 --> 31:12.880]  and make yourself a little bin or a
[31:12.880 --> 31:14.880]  tote or a cooler and you can
[31:14.880 --> 31:16.880]  set an IMO collection in there
[31:16.880 --> 31:18.880]  you know what I mean that will let you feel
[31:18.880 --> 31:20.880]  out what's going on
[31:20.880 --> 31:22.880]  you know you got something right there in the convenience
[31:22.880 --> 31:24.880]  of your house you can look in there on it
[31:24.880 --> 31:26.880]  kind of see what's growing what's going on
[31:26.880 --> 31:28.880]  to me that's also valuable
[31:28.880 --> 31:30.880]  you can do that this time of year it's tough
[31:30.880 --> 31:32.880]  outdoors obviously it's frozen
[31:32.880 --> 31:34.880]  a lot of places you see
[31:35.020 --> 31:37.020]  I got my big coat on
[31:37.020 --> 31:39.020]  cold as hell out there tough to make collections
[31:39.020 --> 31:41.020]  but you can try sometimes there's windows
[31:41.020 --> 31:43.020]  like especially in warmer zones
[31:43.020 --> 31:45.020]  like Virginia it may be winter
[31:45.020 --> 31:47.020]  but if you watch the weather we may
[31:47.020 --> 31:49.020]  get 3, 4, 5, 6 days
[31:49.020 --> 31:51.020]  of like 40s and 60s
[31:51.020 --> 31:53.020]  you know 50s high 50s
[31:53.020 --> 31:55.020]  where you could get a collection so
[31:55.020 --> 31:57.020]  open mind you know I like
[31:57.020 --> 31:59.020]  the idea of grabbing some things
[31:59.020 --> 32:01.020]  from the forest I like the idea of bringing something
[32:01.020 --> 32:03.020]  with you when you go or
[32:03.160 --> 32:05.160]  at least taking some trash and picking up
[32:05.160 --> 32:07.160]  some things to take out as you go too
[32:07.160 --> 32:09.160]  just keeping that balance
[32:09.160 --> 32:11.160]  What do you boys think
[32:11.160 --> 32:13.160]  about
[32:13.160 --> 32:15.160]  I guess after you kind of got the skill set
[32:15.160 --> 32:17.160]  you're being a little successful with it
[32:17.160 --> 32:19.160]  of now taking the time to do this at least
[32:19.160 --> 32:21.160]  four times a year you're getting
[32:21.160 --> 32:23.160]  your seasonal
[32:23.160 --> 32:25.160]  collections and then as the years are
[32:25.160 --> 32:27.160]  going by you're continuing to have those
[32:27.160 --> 32:29.160]  collections so you know just a couple
[32:29.160 --> 32:31.160]  years go by now you almost have a shelf
[32:31.300 --> 32:33.300]  of this stuff do you feel like it's worth
[32:33.300 --> 32:35.300]  the time and effort to see
[32:35.300 --> 32:37.300]  value in the future of what's
[32:37.300 --> 32:39.300]  your farm
[32:39.300 --> 32:41.300]  could potentially become by
[32:41.300 --> 32:43.300]  going out and doing all this due diligence
[32:45.300 --> 32:47.300]  I think so yeah you know you're gonna
[32:47.300 --> 32:49.300]  get rewarded for the work that you put in
[32:49.300 --> 32:51.300]  I mean again
[32:51.300 --> 32:53.300]  at the end of the day we're shooting for diversity
[32:55.300 --> 32:57.300]  go ahead and get as many as possible
[32:57.300 --> 32:59.300]  you're gonna have a lot anyway
[32:59.440 --> 33:01.440]  even if you only do all the different
[33:01.440 --> 33:03.440]  variables in one year
[33:03.440 --> 33:05.440]  because you've got spring, summer, fall
[33:05.440 --> 33:07.440]  sometimes winter depending on where you are
[33:07.440 --> 33:09.440]  and you've got different situations in each one of those
[33:09.440 --> 33:11.440]  seasons that you'd want to collect from
[33:11.440 --> 33:13.440]  in the middle of summer here in Texas I got a lot of
[33:13.440 --> 33:15.440]  collections when we went two months with no
[33:15.440 --> 33:17.440]  rain and it was 100 degrees plus
[33:17.440 --> 33:19.440]  that entire time I've never experienced
[33:19.440 --> 33:21.440]  I know I need those microbes in my soil
[33:21.440 --> 33:23.440]  if I'm gonna grow food here without irrigation
[33:23.440 --> 33:25.440]  especially I need those ones that are
[33:25.440 --> 33:27.440]  gonna survive and be able to
[33:27.580 --> 33:29.580]  continue doing their thing under those conditions
[33:29.580 --> 33:31.580]  so think about that
[33:31.580 --> 33:33.580]  heavy rain seasons really
[33:33.580 --> 33:35.580]  hot, cold you want all that
[33:35.580 --> 33:37.580]  and year after year different places
[33:37.580 --> 33:39.580]  high and low and north, south
[33:39.580 --> 33:41.580]  east, west
[33:41.580 --> 33:43.580]  because all those microbes are gonna be a little
[33:43.580 --> 33:45.580]  different in all those different places
[33:45.580 --> 33:47.580]  again when you look at it
[33:47.580 --> 33:49.580]  under a microscope
[33:49.580 --> 33:51.580]  as far as what we do know
[33:51.580 --> 33:53.580]  and can see a lot of it may look the same
[33:53.580 --> 33:55.580]  but what
[33:55.720 --> 33:57.720]  don't we know that we don't
[33:57.720 --> 33:59.720]  see with what we're capable of seeing
[33:59.720 --> 34:01.720]  there are gonna be slight changes
[34:01.720 --> 34:03.720]  in each one of those spots
[34:03.720 --> 34:05.720]  think about the mountain, one side of the mountain is gonna
[34:05.720 --> 34:07.720]  be completely different vegetation
[34:07.720 --> 34:09.720]  than the other side of the mountain
[34:09.720 --> 34:11.720]  therefore obviously the microbes
[34:11.720 --> 34:13.720]  in the soil are gonna be different too
[34:13.720 --> 34:15.720]  it's a no brainer so
[34:15.720 --> 34:17.720]  get all of those
[34:17.720 --> 34:19.720]  continue to build and build and build, do your due diligence
[34:19.720 --> 34:21.720]  like you said and then diversity
[34:21.720 --> 34:23.720]  will come back and pay you long term
[34:25.720 --> 34:27.720]  yeah Brian I think it is worth it
[34:27.720 --> 34:29.720]  because it's also part of
[34:29.720 --> 34:31.720]  a process, you know what I mean
[34:31.720 --> 34:33.720]  you're baking a cake, there's steps to do
[34:33.720 --> 34:35.720]  to make that cake turn out
[34:35.720 --> 34:37.720]  right, you can have all the ingredients
[34:37.720 --> 34:39.720]  if you put them in
[34:39.720 --> 34:41.720]  the wrong sequence
[34:41.720 --> 34:43.720]  you don't end up with a cake, you end up with
[34:43.720 --> 34:45.720]  something else, so that's why
[34:45.720 --> 34:47.720]  it is important I think
[34:47.720 --> 34:49.720]  to go in there, take those
[34:49.720 --> 34:51.720]  collections, learn how to cook that rice
[34:51.720 --> 34:53.720]  that was valuable up front too
[34:53.860 --> 34:55.860]  learn how to cook rice because for me
[34:55.860 --> 34:57.860]  we grew up, mom and dad
[34:57.860 --> 34:59.860]  always putting on a pot of rice
[34:59.860 --> 35:01.860]  that was second nature, I saw it
[35:01.860 --> 35:03.860]  just kind of oh ok, that's about equal weight
[35:03.860 --> 35:05.860]  equal water and rice and get a good pot of rice
[35:05.860 --> 35:07.860]  but for some people
[35:07.860 --> 35:09.860]  like you said, they grab the uncle
[35:09.860 --> 35:11.860]  Barron's bag, throw it in the drone and boil it up
[35:11.860 --> 35:13.860]  so yeah it is key to kind of
[35:13.860 --> 35:15.860]  learn that and also
[35:15.860 --> 35:17.860]  I found a place in Arkansas
[35:17.860 --> 35:19.860]  with some native grown
[35:19.860 --> 35:21.860]  organic rice, I had
[35:22.000 --> 35:24.000]  the opportunity to share that company
[35:24.000 --> 35:26.000]  but that's been my source
[35:26.000 --> 35:28.000]  now, you know what I mean, that's as close
[35:28.000 --> 35:30.000]  as I can get to
[35:30.000 --> 35:32.000]  where I live in Virginia, it's on the
[35:32.000 --> 35:34.000]  soil of the US and it's an organic
[35:34.000 --> 35:36.000]  product so I feel like
[35:36.000 --> 35:38.000]  it's a great option
[35:38.000 --> 35:40.000]  it just eliminates some of the
[35:40.000 --> 35:42.000]  oh well where did that rice come from
[35:42.000 --> 35:44.000]  did it ship in from Thailand
[35:44.000 --> 35:46.000]  that kind of stuff, so just doing those kind of things
[35:46.000 --> 35:48.000]  to me, take that principle
[35:48.000 --> 35:50.000]  those processes
[35:50.140 --> 35:52.140]  and just refine them and make them fit
[35:52.140 --> 35:54.140]  kind of what you got going
[35:54.140 --> 35:56.140]  you can make things better
[35:56.140 --> 35:58.140]  you know what I mean, there are better
[35:58.140 --> 36:00.140]  sources of ingredients
[36:00.140 --> 36:02.140]  we all know that so if you take
[36:02.140 --> 36:04.140]  the time I think you can find
[36:04.140 --> 36:06.140]  some of those better ingredients
[36:06.140 --> 36:08.140]  and make that process even better than it already is
[36:08.140 --> 36:10.140]  it's made to kind of be
[36:10.140 --> 36:12.140]  the poor man's nutrition
[36:12.140 --> 36:14.140]  for the poor farmer
[36:14.140 --> 36:16.140]  because most farmers, if you're
[36:16.140 --> 36:18.140]  not poor, you don't really have the money to
[36:18.280 --> 36:20.280]  be wasting, right, and that's all of us
[36:20.280 --> 36:22.280]  so if you can kind of do these processes
[36:22.280 --> 36:24.280]  very low, very
[36:24.280 --> 36:26.280]  cheap cost, now you got
[36:26.280 --> 36:28.280]  money for other things, so yeah definitely
[36:28.280 --> 36:30.280]  I think it's all part of that process man
[36:30.280 --> 36:32.280]  and a lot of people hit me with, well if I
[36:32.280 --> 36:34.280]  take this mold
[36:34.280 --> 36:36.280]  and then combine it with this
[36:36.280 --> 36:38.280]  isn't that technically going to be IMO 3
[36:38.280 --> 36:40.280]  but no, I say
[36:40.280 --> 36:42.280]  every time I say no because it's a process
[36:42.280 --> 36:44.280]  it's collect the IMO
[36:44.280 --> 36:46.280]  and the rice
[36:46.420 --> 36:48.420]  make it dormant
[36:48.420 --> 36:50.420]  with sugar, IMO 1
[36:50.420 --> 36:52.420]  take it on to the next step
[36:52.420 --> 36:54.420]  adding the sugars, IMO 2
[36:54.420 --> 36:56.420]  and then from there working your IMO
[36:56.420 --> 36:58.420]  3 piles, but you can't
[36:58.420 --> 37:00.420]  just take a part of this
[37:00.420 --> 37:02.420]  to me and then throw it in and call
[37:02.420 --> 37:04.420]  it something, now that doesn't mean what you did
[37:04.420 --> 37:06.420]  wasn't valuable, but it's
[37:06.420 --> 37:08.420]  just not called, you know
[37:08.420 --> 37:10.420]  IMO 3 because you didn't go through that process
[37:10.420 --> 37:12.420]  so that's all it is, and what that does
[37:12.420 --> 37:14.420]  man, and that's not like anyone
[37:14.560 --> 37:16.560]  trying to say, well you're not doing
[37:16.560 --> 37:18.560]  it the right way, or you're not doing
[37:18.560 --> 37:20.560]  what that is, is keeping us all on the same
[37:20.560 --> 37:22.560]  playing field, so when we're talking
[37:22.560 --> 37:24.560]  we know we're talking about the same
[37:24.560 --> 37:26.560]  thing, you know, we're talking IMO 3
[37:26.560 --> 37:28.560]  you know, we're not talking
[37:28.560 --> 37:30.560]  an inoculated
[37:30.560 --> 37:32.560]  straw pile or something, you know what I'm saying
[37:32.560 --> 37:34.560]  there's different levels to this so
[37:34.560 --> 37:36.560]  I think it's worthwhile for us to kind of
[37:36.560 --> 37:38.560]  stick to kind of the
[37:38.560 --> 37:40.560]  main teachings, you know, Master Cho
[37:40.560 --> 37:42.560]  obviously is a great resource
[37:42.700 --> 37:44.700]  and then others such as I feel like
[37:44.700 --> 37:46.700]  Sheldon, others, myself
[37:46.700 --> 37:48.700]  that are out there, and learn
[37:48.700 --> 37:50.700]  these processes the right way
[37:50.700 --> 37:52.700]  call them the right thing, then jump into
[37:52.700 --> 37:54.700]  the experimentation
[37:56.700 --> 37:58.700]  When you're talking quality
[37:58.700 --> 38:00.700]  time and effort, return on your
[38:00.700 --> 38:02.700]  investment of time
[38:02.700 --> 38:04.700]  do you think boiling the water
[38:04.700 --> 38:06.700]  is worth it instead of throwing it
[38:06.700 --> 38:08.700]  in the microwave and
[38:08.700 --> 38:10.700]  you know, some people say
[38:10.840 --> 38:12.840]  the kind of rice matters
[38:12.840 --> 38:14.840]  some people say as long as you get the rice
[38:14.840 --> 38:16.840]  cooked the right way, it doesn't necessarily matter
[38:16.840 --> 38:18.840]  what are your thoughts on that as well?
[38:23.750 --> 38:25.750]  You can cook it however you want to
[38:25.750 --> 38:27.750]  you can use whatever
[38:27.750 --> 38:29.750]  you want to, you know what
[38:29.750 --> 38:31.750]  I mean? There are best practices
[38:31.750 --> 38:33.750]  and then there's
[38:33.750 --> 38:35.750]  use what you have, right
[38:35.750 --> 38:37.750]  and it's about finding that
[38:37.750 --> 38:39.750]  happy medium there, so best
[38:39.750 --> 38:41.750]  practice as it was taught to me
[38:41.890 --> 38:43.890]  is short or medium grain, cow rose
[38:43.890 --> 38:45.890]  like sushi rice
[38:45.890 --> 38:47.890]  right, it's the actual physical
[38:47.890 --> 38:49.890]  property, like the physical
[38:49.890 --> 38:51.890]  makeup of it, the shape of it, and how
[38:51.890 --> 38:53.890]  when it is cooked this certain way
[38:53.890 --> 38:55.890]  it creates this conglomerate
[38:55.890 --> 38:57.890]  with the right amount of air flow
[38:57.890 --> 38:59.890]  and everything that is good for the microbes
[38:59.890 --> 39:01.890]  as well as being that
[39:01.890 --> 39:03.890]  an intentional poor
[39:03.890 --> 39:05.890]  food source, so that the microbes that
[39:05.890 --> 39:07.890]  are able to, you know
[39:07.890 --> 39:09.890]  get into that collection and start colonizing
[39:10.030 --> 39:12.030]  the strong ones, they are able to live and
[39:12.030 --> 39:14.030]  survive even under these less
[39:14.030 --> 39:16.030]  than desirable conditions, it's a very
[39:16.030 --> 39:18.030]  simple basic cheap food
[39:18.030 --> 39:20.030]  but here we are, you know, that's what
[39:20.030 --> 39:22.030]  we're taking with us now
[39:22.030 --> 39:24.030]  so that being
[39:24.030 --> 39:26.030]  said, you can use what you
[39:26.030 --> 39:28.030]  have, but when you're doing like the
[39:28.030 --> 39:30.030]  Uncle Ben's rice bag and you're putting it in there
[39:30.030 --> 39:32.030]  you have no control over the moisture
[39:32.030 --> 39:34.030]  content of the rice, that's a
[39:34.030 --> 39:36.030]  variable that you want to have control
[39:36.030 --> 39:38.030]  over, and
[39:38.170 --> 39:40.170]  personally I wouldn't use it for
[39:40.170 --> 39:42.170]  several reasons, but the consistency when it's
[39:42.170 --> 39:44.170]  done is so soft and sticky, you don't want
[39:44.170 --> 39:46.170]  it that really soft
[39:46.170 --> 39:48.170]  squishy consistency, because
[39:48.170 --> 39:50.170]  that's when things get anaerobic, that's when you
[39:50.170 --> 39:52.170]  that's what causes those really
[39:52.170 --> 39:54.170]  funky looking collections with the reds and the
[39:54.170 --> 39:56.170]  blues and purples and greens, there's no
[39:56.170 --> 39:58.170]  oxygen in there, they can't breathe
[39:58.170 --> 40:00.170]  we want aerobic, meaning
[40:00.170 --> 40:02.170]  oxygen preferring organisms
[40:02.170 --> 40:04.170]  not anaerobic
[40:04.170 --> 40:06.170]  you know, those anaerobic organisms, they're
[40:06.310 --> 40:08.310]  easy to come by, we don't need to intentionally
[40:08.310 --> 40:10.310]  culture those, we want the good aerobic
[40:10.310 --> 40:12.310]  ones, right?
[40:12.310 --> 40:14.310]  I hope I'm still on track, sorry
[40:14.310 --> 40:16.310]  Yeah, good point, man
[40:16.310 --> 40:18.310]  we've also, we've actually, well my wife
[40:18.310 --> 40:20.310]  did, read some stuff here recently
[40:20.310 --> 40:22.310]  about the microwave, you know
[40:22.310 --> 40:24.310]  like, it's not even really, it kind of changes
[40:24.310 --> 40:26.310]  the properties of some of your food
[40:26.310 --> 40:28.310]  it's not the best option, if you
[40:28.310 --> 40:30.310]  really want to heat your food up, a better option
[40:30.310 --> 40:32.310]  is like the oven, a pan
[40:32.310 --> 40:34.310]  or like an air fryer, you know, like
[40:34.450 --> 40:36.450]  direct heat, but that's a whole different
[40:36.450 --> 40:38.450]  rabbit hole, I've never
[40:38.450 --> 40:40.450]  made rice in the microwave, you know
[40:40.450 --> 40:42.450]  like, to me that would be like, kind of sacrilegious
[40:42.450 --> 40:44.450]  but, just cause
[40:44.450 --> 40:46.450]  you know, like
[40:46.450 --> 40:48.450]  make a pot of rice, you know what I mean?
[40:48.450 --> 40:50.450]  I don't do a lot of microwave cooking, but
[40:50.450 --> 40:52.450]  like Sheldon said, man, use
[40:52.450 --> 40:54.450]  what's available to you, you know what I mean?
[40:54.450 --> 40:56.450]  If you live in a studio apartment
[40:56.450 --> 40:58.450]  and you only have a microwave, microwave
[40:58.450 --> 41:00.450]  some rice, if you got
[41:00.450 --> 41:02.450]  a pot in the stove, put a pot
[41:02.590 --> 41:04.590]  on, you know, try
[41:04.590 --> 41:06.590]  two different ways, you know, see what you think
[41:06.590 --> 41:08.590]  the key to the rice is more about
[41:08.590 --> 41:10.590]  just the consistency, like Sheldon
[41:10.590 --> 41:12.590]  was saying, like the, you know, the
[41:12.590 --> 41:14.590]  al dente, you want to, you know, you don't want it too
[41:14.590 --> 41:16.590]  soft, be too wet, and you want
[41:16.590 --> 41:18.590]  that rice to lay kind of loose, you want the
[41:18.590 --> 41:20.590]  particles to be loose in there, not just
[41:20.590 --> 41:22.590]  tightly packed, you know what I mean? So you don't want
[41:22.590 --> 41:24.590]  to wet rice for that reason
[41:24.590 --> 41:26.590]  but, yeah, I mean, I would
[41:26.590 --> 41:28.590]  you know, kind of say microwaving is probably
[41:28.590 --> 41:30.590]  a bit much, but, you know, just
[41:30.730 --> 41:32.730]  if you need boiling water, a microwave
[41:32.730 --> 41:34.730]  will boil water, you know?
[41:34.730 --> 41:36.730]  You mentioned the consistency
[41:36.730 --> 41:38.730]  do you feel like, well
[41:38.730 --> 41:40.730]  maybe if, you know, money isn't an object
[41:40.730 --> 41:42.730]  you know, money's always an object
[41:42.730 --> 41:44.730]  but maybe it's, you know, I've saved
[41:44.730 --> 41:46.730]  a little bit to budget this out
[41:46.730 --> 41:48.730]  do you think it's worth buying, like, a sushi
[41:48.730 --> 41:50.730]  rice machine so that
[41:50.730 --> 41:52.730]  you are consistent because you are taking
[41:52.730 --> 41:54.730]  that rice out to the, you know
[41:54.730 --> 41:56.730]  usually probably at least 30 minutes or an hour
[41:56.730 --> 41:58.730]  out to somewhere that's away
[41:58.870 --> 42:00.870]  from the city unless you're lucky enough to live
[42:00.870 --> 42:02.870]  you know, where we all hope to live
[42:02.870 --> 42:04.870]  one day out, you know, with your own property
[42:04.870 --> 42:06.870]  but to get it away from the city, I mean, that's
[42:06.870 --> 42:08.870]  a trick in itself, do you think
[42:08.870 --> 42:10.870]  the consistency, you know
[42:10.870 --> 42:12.870]  obviously is paramount
[42:12.870 --> 42:14.870]  so spending money on a machine
[42:14.870 --> 42:20.130]  is that worth it?
[42:20.130 --> 42:22.130]  I don't know what a sushi machine is
[42:22.130 --> 42:24.130]  brothers, I can't speak on that
[42:24.130 --> 42:26.130]  I got a rice cooker, you know
[42:26.130 --> 42:28.130]  It's like a, yeah, it's basically
[42:28.130 --> 42:30.130]  a rice cooker but it does it a little bit softer
[42:30.270 --> 42:32.270]  so that it's stickier than, like, a rice
[42:32.270 --> 42:34.270]  cooker. Well, we don't want that, remember
[42:34.270 --> 42:36.270]  that's going to be too sticky, we want that
[42:36.270 --> 42:38.270]  al dente. But I think you
[42:38.270 --> 42:40.270]  yeah, I think you can, like, dial them in
[42:40.270 --> 42:42.270]  and stuff like that. Oh, okay, I got you
[42:42.270 --> 42:44.270]  but yeah, so maybe it does
[42:44.270 --> 42:46.270]  sound like if you overdo technology
[42:46.270 --> 42:48.270]  you're probably going to have issues
[42:48.270 --> 42:50.270]  than just boiling some rice
[42:50.270 --> 42:52.270]  My personal favorite
[42:52.270 --> 42:54.270]  Yeah, you can boil it but a rice cooker is easy too
[42:54.270 --> 42:56.270]  brother, sorry, sorry
[42:56.270 --> 42:58.270]  a rice cooker is super simple, man
[42:58.410 --> 43:00.410]  you can buy, like, really cheap ones
[43:00.410 --> 43:02.410]  they're, like, small and they're, like, 20 bucks
[43:02.410 --> 43:04.410]  That's all I was going to say
[43:04.410 --> 43:06.410]  is that's what I personally use
[43:06.410 --> 43:08.410]  is a $10-20 cheapo
[43:08.410 --> 43:10.410]  rice cooker, man. Put your
[43:10.410 --> 43:12.410]  rice and water in there, you can
[43:12.410 --> 43:14.410]  use a measuring cup, a 1 to 1
[43:14.410 --> 43:16.410]  or, you know, .75 to 1, whatever you're
[43:16.410 --> 43:18.410]  doing, it's super simple, close it, press a button
[43:18.410 --> 43:20.410]  when it beeps, come back, it's
[43:20.410 --> 43:22.410]  ready to go, man. I mean, it literally doesn't
[43:22.410 --> 43:24.410]  get any easier once you figure out what those ratios
[43:24.410 --> 43:26.410]  are and how they work and how
[43:26.550 --> 43:28.550]  to just dial it in on call
[43:28.550 --> 43:30.550]  you're set
[43:30.550 --> 43:32.550]  repeated results
[43:34.550 --> 43:36.550]  I think that's just honestly what
[43:36.550 --> 43:38.550]  people want is because it's
[43:38.550 --> 43:40.550]  honestly, it's frustrating if you
[43:40.550 --> 43:42.550]  don't find success at the beginning
[43:42.550 --> 43:44.550]  especially if you spend the time, like, if you're so new
[43:44.550 --> 43:46.550]  to this that you built your own boxes
[43:46.550 --> 43:48.550]  and, you know, I mean, there's
[43:48.550 --> 43:50.550]  a lot of time and labor and trips to
[43:50.550 --> 43:52.550]  Home Depot and, I mean, there's just a lot of time
[43:52.550 --> 43:54.550]  involved, so
[43:54.690 --> 43:56.690]  getting this dialed in with almost like some kind
[43:56.690 --> 43:58.690]  of beginner blueprint
[43:58.690 --> 44:00.690]  I know that the audience will appreciate
[44:00.690 --> 44:02.690]  what you boys are talking about today to try
[44:02.690 --> 44:04.690]  to minimize that learning curve
[44:04.690 --> 44:06.690]  but, again, this is a lifelong skill
[44:06.690 --> 44:08.690]  so, you know, there's something
[44:08.690 --> 44:10.690]  to be said about that as well
[44:10.690 --> 44:12.690]  So, Blue,
[44:12.690 --> 44:14.690]  like, just think about
[44:14.690 --> 44:16.690]  it, though, have you ever, when you
[44:16.690 --> 44:18.690]  taken the time, found a great
[44:18.690 --> 44:20.690]  spot, set your collection
[44:20.690 --> 44:22.690]  have you ever really had
[44:22.830 --> 44:24.830]  issues getting a good collection
[44:24.830 --> 44:26.830]  when you did those steps that it took
[44:26.830 --> 44:28.830]  ahead of the process?
[44:30.830 --> 44:32.830]  Yes, but not often
[44:32.830 --> 44:34.830]  you know, it usually
[44:34.830 --> 44:36.830]  comes down to
[44:36.830 --> 44:38.830]  life happening, you know, it's like
[44:38.830 --> 44:40.830]  I plan on getting out there at 1pm
[44:40.830 --> 44:42.830]  on this day, but, you know, this came up
[44:42.830 --> 44:44.830]  so I don't get out there until 6 or 7pm
[44:44.830 --> 44:46.830]  and that's enough time
[44:46.830 --> 44:48.830]  when we're talking about IMO, especially, you know
[44:48.830 --> 44:50.830]  oh, shit, it rained between 4 and 5pm
[44:50.970 --> 44:52.970]  you know what I'm saying?
[44:52.970 --> 44:54.970]  So that changes things dramatically, too
[44:54.970 --> 44:56.970]  and things to consider when
[44:56.970 --> 44:58.970]  you're setting out your box
[44:58.970 --> 45:00.970]  look at the forecast, you know
[45:00.970 --> 45:02.970]  even if it doesn't call for rain, you want to have
[45:02.970 --> 45:04.970]  extra, you know, caution
[45:04.970 --> 45:06.970]  tape up, well, not tape, but tie up a tarp
[45:06.970 --> 45:08.970]  or something, you know, up to the tree
[45:08.970 --> 45:10.970]  cover your box or whatever you've got
[45:10.970 --> 45:12.970]  laundry baskets, what have you, just to protect it
[45:12.970 --> 45:14.970]  rodents, animals
[45:14.970 --> 45:16.970]  that's a big thing, you know
[45:16.970 --> 45:18.970]  people always message me like, man
[45:19.110 --> 45:21.110]  I can't keep the rats out or the raccoons
[45:21.110 --> 45:23.110]  every time I come back, my box is, you know
[45:23.110 --> 45:25.110]  10 yards away, it's empty
[45:25.110 --> 45:27.110]  you know, it's like, I'm tired of it
[45:27.110 --> 45:29.110]  it's been a month straight now, it's like, do something
[45:29.110 --> 45:31.110]  about it, you know, put a cage
[45:31.110 --> 45:33.110]  around it, take a laundry basket and put a
[45:33.110 --> 45:35.110]  cinder block on top to weight it down, whatever you've got
[45:35.110 --> 45:37.110]  to do, use what you've got, but, you know
[45:37.110 --> 45:39.110]  IMO is your baby, treat it
[45:39.110 --> 45:41.110]  as such
[45:41.110 --> 45:43.110]  Yeah, good points, man
[45:43.110 --> 45:45.110]  on, a lot of times, it is
[45:45.110 --> 45:47.110]  the timing, like, that gets
[45:47.250 --> 45:49.250]  people in trouble, like, and you've got to be honest
[45:49.250 --> 45:51.250]  with yourself, because I'll ask people
[45:51.250 --> 45:53.250]  they'll send me, does this look like a good collection?
[45:53.250 --> 45:55.250]  I'm like, you know, well, it looks okay
[45:55.250 --> 45:57.250]  you know, usually I say it looks good
[45:57.250 --> 45:59.250]  then I say, how long did it collect?
[45:59.250 --> 46:01.250]  and usually, it'll be
[46:01.250 --> 46:03.250]  too long, it's usually they set
[46:03.250 --> 46:05.250]  out too long, so, you know, 12
[46:05.250 --> 46:07.250]  days, I'm like, damn, man, it's summertime
[46:07.250 --> 46:09.250]  that's gone, it's like through a three-day
[46:09.250 --> 46:11.250]  process, you know, and so
[46:11.250 --> 46:13.250]  that's usually what it boils down to
[46:13.250 --> 46:15.250]  Brian, I think those
[46:15.390 --> 46:17.390]  things increase your odds
[46:17.390 --> 46:19.390]  doing it, really being meticulous about
[46:19.390 --> 46:21.390]  where you collect, and how you collect
[46:21.390 --> 46:23.390]  and then, a collection
[46:23.390 --> 46:25.390]  ain't shit, like Blue said, if you
[46:25.390 --> 46:27.390]  don't have security, you know, I mean, if you don't
[46:27.390 --> 46:29.390]  if you come back and all your stuff
[46:29.390 --> 46:31.390]  is gone and scattered, then the collection
[46:31.390 --> 46:33.390]  wasn't anything, no matter how
[46:33.390 --> 46:35.390]  good it was, so take the
[46:35.390 --> 46:37.390]  time early, and if you ever see an animal
[46:37.390 --> 46:39.390]  get in your box, don't
[46:39.390 --> 46:41.390]  think, alright, well, I'll put it somewhere else
[46:41.390 --> 46:43.390]  and it won't happen again, you've been
[46:43.530 --> 46:45.530]  exposed, you know what I mean, go ahead and
[46:45.530 --> 46:47.530]  up your game, I like the laundry basket
[46:47.530 --> 46:49.530]  tech, I actually like a tote
[46:49.530 --> 46:51.530]  for me, better, because
[46:51.530 --> 46:53.530]  I like to close off that air
[46:53.530 --> 46:55.530]  space in there, kind of make a little micro
[46:55.530 --> 46:57.530]  climate that's where just my box
[46:57.530 --> 46:59.530]  the air space around
[46:59.530 --> 47:01.530]  and then the earth, you know
[47:01.530 --> 47:03.530]  so, but yeah, man, I think
[47:03.530 --> 47:05.530]  this will be great, I love kind of where
[47:05.530 --> 47:07.530]  this conversation's going, and I
[47:07.530 --> 47:09.530]  you're dropping lots of nice tips and
[47:09.530 --> 47:11.530]  tricks, I've been already
[47:11.670 --> 47:13.670]  taking about three pages of notes, man, just
[47:13.670 --> 47:15.670]  things that, like, you know, when you
[47:15.670 --> 47:17.670]  do things, sometimes you forget shit
[47:17.670 --> 47:19.670]  like, you forgot that
[47:19.670 --> 47:21.670]  you know, like, oh, that's right, damn, I'm forgetting
[47:21.670 --> 47:23.670]  my own principles, you know, so
[47:23.670 --> 47:25.670]  it doesn't matter who you are, man, it's good to talk
[47:25.670 --> 47:27.670]  about this stuff with people, listen to shows
[47:27.670 --> 47:29.670]  like this and get kind of reminders
[47:29.670 --> 47:31.670]  about, oh yeah, that's right, you know
[47:31.670 --> 47:33.670]  so yeah, great show
[47:33.670 --> 47:35.670]  so far, man
[47:35.670 --> 47:37.670]  I saw this weird documentary
[47:37.670 --> 47:39.670]  I don't know why it made me think of this, but
[47:39.810 --> 47:41.810]  these people
[47:41.810 --> 47:43.810]  were jumping out of planes and, like, doing
[47:43.810 --> 47:45.810]  photography, so if you paid to jump out of the plane
[47:45.810 --> 47:47.810]  you know, they would record your
[47:47.810 --> 47:49.810]  jump, and it was, like,
[47:49.810 --> 47:51.810]  you know, your tandem to a professional and all this stuff
[47:51.810 --> 47:53.810]  well, event, like, throughout
[47:53.810 --> 47:55.810]  that industry, there were individuals
[47:55.810 --> 47:57.810]  that were dying because
[47:57.810 --> 47:59.810]  they were forgetting, because they were such pros
[47:59.810 --> 48:01.810]  at this stuff, they were actually
[48:01.810 --> 48:03.810]  literally forgetting to pull their own shoot
[48:03.810 --> 48:05.810]  because they were so into, like, you know, doing
[48:05.810 --> 48:07.810]  the camera and all this, so I think
[48:07.950 --> 48:09.950]  it's good to, when you're a professional
[48:09.950 --> 48:11.950]  when you're a pro, when you feel like you're maybe
[48:11.950 --> 48:13.950]  one of the thought leaders in what you're trying to do
[48:13.950 --> 48:15.950]  to kind of bring yourself back
[48:15.950 --> 48:17.950]  and rethink some things and kind of
[48:17.950 --> 48:19.950]  get back to, well, you know, how is a
[48:19.950 --> 48:21.950]  beginner person thinking through these things? How is
[48:21.950 --> 48:23.950]  an intermediate type individual thinking
[48:23.950 --> 48:25.950]  through these things? Because
[48:25.950 --> 48:27.950]  you know, I guess in a weird way, that metaphor
[48:27.950 --> 48:29.950]  would be like, because you could potentially blow up
[48:29.950 --> 48:31.950]  your living soil system if you just go
[48:31.950 --> 48:33.950]  crazy with amendments and you're
[48:33.950 --> 48:35.950]  constantly thinking you have to add things
[48:36.090 --> 48:38.090]  or you're just constantly hovering over stuff when you
[48:38.090 --> 48:40.090]  should be, you know, maybe enjoying life
[48:40.090 --> 48:42.090]  a little bit, because that's the point of a living soil
[48:42.090 --> 48:44.090]  system, is you kind of set it up, and then the goal
[48:44.090 --> 48:46.090]  is to maintain it. Those girls shouldn't
[48:46.090 --> 48:48.090]  be so dependent on you like you're probably
[48:48.090 --> 48:50.090]  used to if you've come from different
[48:50.090 --> 48:52.090]  methodologies. You know, those girls
[48:52.090 --> 48:54.090]  are dependent on you when pH is paramount.
[48:54.090 --> 48:56.090]  Yeah, it's all, you know,
[48:56.090 --> 48:58.090]  everything is up to the way that you
[48:58.090 --> 49:00.090]  handle that, but again,
[49:00.090 --> 49:02.090]  when we realize that it's not really up to us,
[49:02.090 --> 49:04.090]  we trust the process, I think that's
[49:04.230 --> 49:06.230]  where a lot of individuals that might not have
[49:06.230 --> 49:08.230]  that botany level
[49:08.230 --> 49:10.230]  understanding of plants can still find
[49:10.230 --> 49:12.230]  success because they're using Mother Nature.
[49:12.230 --> 49:14.230]  And myself included in that,
[49:14.230 --> 49:16.230]  and I hope that you guys see I've been
[49:16.230 --> 49:18.230]  carrying that banner forever, where it's
[49:18.230 --> 49:20.230]  Mother Nature doing this, so we can all get
[49:20.230 --> 49:22.230]  it, you know, you don't have to be college
[49:22.230 --> 49:24.230]  educated or something like that to really
[49:24.230 --> 49:26.230]  understand this. It's more about just kind
[49:26.230 --> 49:28.230]  of like going through the experience, seeing what
[49:28.230 --> 49:30.230]  works, listening to others, and then
[49:30.230 --> 49:32.230]  dialing in your own process.
[49:34.230 --> 49:36.230]  Definitely. Hey, I want to just say
[49:36.230 --> 49:38.230]  right quick,
[49:38.230 --> 49:40.230]  man, hey, anybody out there,
[49:40.230 --> 49:42.230]  suicide's a serious
[49:42.230 --> 49:44.230]  thing, bro, like,
[49:44.230 --> 49:46.230]  there's a show on YouTube, and I
[49:46.230 --> 49:48.230]  don't want to turn it this way, but I want to say
[49:48.230 --> 49:50.230]  this, because a lot of people have shit going on out there.
[49:50.230 --> 49:52.230]  There's a YouTube out there
[49:52.230 --> 49:54.230]  where there's like, I think it was 27
[49:54.230 --> 49:56.230]  people that jumped off the Golden
[49:56.230 --> 49:58.230]  Gate Bridge to kill themselves and lived.
[49:58.230 --> 50:00.230]  And they interviewed some of these
[50:00.230 --> 50:02.230]  people. And all the people,
[50:02.370 --> 50:04.370]  every one of them said as soon
[50:04.370 --> 50:06.370]  as they motherfucking jumped, they were like,
[50:06.370 --> 50:08.370]  damn, I shouldn't have did that.
[50:08.370 --> 50:10.370]  You know what I'm saying? And they tightened up
[50:10.370 --> 50:12.370]  and somehow survived. Point
[50:12.370 --> 50:14.370]  is,
[50:14.370 --> 50:16.370]  there's other options, man.
[50:16.370 --> 50:18.370]  You know what I mean? And if you guys
[50:18.370 --> 50:20.370]  out there having a tough time, man, reach out to some
[50:20.370 --> 50:22.370]  people to talk to. I just want to throw that out there.
[50:22.370 --> 50:24.370]  You know,
[50:24.370 --> 50:26.370]  serious stuff. But back to
[50:26.370 --> 50:28.370]  the natural farming, these kinds
[50:28.370 --> 50:30.370]  of things are also what can keep you grounded,
[50:30.510 --> 50:32.510]  man. Have something
[50:32.510 --> 50:34.510]  to occupy your mind. I had
[50:34.510 --> 50:36.510]  someone hit me on Instagram
[50:36.510 --> 50:38.510]  a little bit back and said, man,
[50:38.510 --> 50:40.510]  you're the only reason
[50:40.510 --> 50:42.510]  I'm wanting to keep on
[50:42.510 --> 50:44.510]  growing or whatever it was.
[50:44.510 --> 50:46.510]  I could sense that he was having issues.
[50:46.510 --> 50:48.510]  And I was like, man, there's a lot
[50:48.510 --> 50:50.510]  of us out here, bro.
[50:50.510 --> 50:52.510]  You know what I mean? It's not just me.
[50:52.510 --> 50:54.510]  Look for good, positive people.
[50:54.510 --> 50:56.510]  You know what I mean? These things
[50:56.510 --> 50:58.510]  for me, they keep my mind occupied.
[50:58.650 --> 51:00.650]  I like to be
[51:00.650 --> 51:02.650]  doing shit. I'm always in the stuff.
[51:02.650 --> 51:04.650]  I'm doing stuff. If you want to do
[51:04.650 --> 51:06.650]  something and you want to feel like you got
[51:06.650 --> 51:08.650]  some responsibility, start an IMO
[51:08.650 --> 51:10.650]  three pile because that's like
[51:10.650 --> 51:12.650]  a baby. You will be
[51:12.650 --> 51:14.650]  tending to that pile
[51:14.650 --> 51:16.650]  a lot.
[51:16.650 --> 51:18.650]  And it'll be something that keeps you
[51:18.650 --> 51:20.650]  focused and it's something that keeps your mind
[51:20.650 --> 51:22.650]  on something different if you're
[51:22.650 --> 51:24.650]  having a lot of trouble. So even if
[51:24.650 --> 51:26.650]  you had a shitty day at work or something,
[51:26.790 --> 51:28.790]  these natural farming techniques are something
[51:28.790 --> 51:30.790]  that can, once that clock goes off,
[51:30.790 --> 51:32.790]  you can readjust your mind and get focused
[51:32.790 --> 51:34.790]  back into this.
[51:34.790 --> 51:36.790]  And just keep
[51:36.790 --> 51:38.790]  a healthy, open mind about yourself.
[51:38.790 --> 51:40.790]  But that's, man, natural farming
[51:40.790 --> 51:42.790]  is a great way to
[51:42.790 --> 51:44.790]  build your mind and your
[51:44.790 --> 51:46.790]  body. Because I always say that
[51:46.790 --> 51:48.790]  farming is a physical activity.
[51:48.790 --> 51:50.790]  You know what I mean? You got to
[51:50.790 --> 51:52.790]  be doing something. So it's
[51:52.790 --> 51:54.790]  not like just sitting on the couch watching
[51:54.930 --> 51:56.930]  Netflix on here. You got to actually be
[51:56.930 --> 51:58.930]  out there doing stuff. Collecting
[51:58.930 --> 52:00.930]  IMO, you're in the forest, right?
[52:00.930 --> 52:02.930]  You're walking. I encourage
[52:02.930 --> 52:04.930]  it. Go out there. Walk.
[52:04.930 --> 52:06.930]  See what's out in the forest. Feel
[52:06.930 --> 52:08.930]  that peace. Just feel like
[52:08.930 --> 52:10.930]  a lot of people have never done that.
[52:10.930 --> 52:12.930]  Go out in the woods and just feel that peace where
[52:12.930 --> 52:14.930]  you don't hear anything but the woods
[52:14.930 --> 52:16.930]  and smell those smells and stuff
[52:16.930 --> 52:18.930]  like that.
[52:18.930 --> 52:20.930]  Yeah, a little bit
[52:20.930 --> 52:22.930]  of a rant, but definitely,
[52:23.070 --> 52:25.070]  man, try this stuff. Put those bottles
[52:25.070 --> 52:27.070]  down, man. There's no
[52:27.070 --> 52:29.070]  need to spend all this money.
[52:29.070 --> 52:31.070]  I can't stand seeing the posts
[52:31.070 --> 52:33.070]  where I like to support good
[52:33.070 --> 52:35.070]  people, but when I see the cannabis
[52:35.070 --> 52:37.070]  grows and they show their little
[52:37.070 --> 52:39.070]  flower and they list out 10 brand
[52:39.070 --> 52:41.070]  names. All these brand names
[52:41.070 --> 52:43.070]  did all this. Well, fuck. I'm
[52:43.070 --> 52:45.070]  showing that same flower
[52:45.070 --> 52:47.070]  and I ain't got all them brand names. This is
[52:47.070 --> 52:49.070]  stuff that I'm making. So you could
[52:49.070 --> 52:51.070]  do everything you want to
[52:51.210 --> 52:53.210]  do and more just making these
[52:53.210 --> 52:55.210]  things yourself. You're going to get a
[52:55.210 --> 52:57.210]  better ... Who's going to make it better? Me
[52:57.210 --> 52:59.210]  or that guy that put it in that bottle?
[52:59.210 --> 53:01.210]  I'm going to trust myself more.
[53:01.210 --> 53:03.210]  That's what this is all about, man.
[53:03.210 --> 53:05.210]  Being the master of your garden.
[53:05.210 --> 53:07.210]  Natural farming principle. Be the master
[53:07.210 --> 53:09.210]  of your garden. You are the master of your garden.
[53:11.210 --> 53:13.210]  Yeah, man.
[53:13.210 --> 53:15.210]  Well said. I think
[53:15.210 --> 53:17.210]  when you have control of that system,
[53:17.210 --> 53:19.210]  then when you're making mistakes,
[53:19.350 --> 53:21.350]  you're able to ... Like Sheldon was bringing up,
[53:21.350 --> 53:23.350]  you got your notes, you got your notebook,
[53:23.350 --> 53:25.350]  you're going back, you're like, all right, maybe I
[53:25.350 --> 53:27.350]  messed up here. Maybe I thought I was
[53:27.350 --> 53:29.350]  a little bit smarter than I am and I
[53:29.350 --> 53:31.350]  changed the recipe because Sheldon's
[53:31.350 --> 53:33.350]  100 on that. I think
[53:33.350 --> 53:35.350]  a lot of individuals think that they can
[53:35.350 --> 53:37.350]  improve something just as soon as they hear it.
[53:37.350 --> 53:39.350]  To really get
[53:39.350 --> 53:41.350]  the boots on the ground, if you will,
[53:41.350 --> 53:43.350]  I think you got to try to
[53:43.350 --> 53:45.350]  kind of
[53:45.350 --> 53:47.350]  trust again that process of
[53:47.490 --> 53:49.490]  getting the others before you
[53:49.490 --> 53:51.490]  and then when you find success,
[53:51.490 --> 53:53.490]  play around with the acorns. I think there's
[53:53.490 --> 53:55.490]  something magical with those.
[53:55.490 --> 53:57.490]  I'm sure there's other stuff out there that other people
[53:57.490 --> 53:59.490]  could chime in, but I've personally seen
[53:59.490 --> 54:01.490]  that when you are playing around with more of the IMOs
[54:01.490 --> 54:03.490]  with the acorns, it seems like it is a little bit
[54:03.490 --> 54:05.490]  easier. That's just
[54:05.490 --> 54:07.490]  my own personal experience.
[54:07.490 --> 54:09.490]  I think that might have also been
[54:09.490 --> 54:11.490]  the location that you had.
[54:11.490 --> 54:13.490]  It was a very fertile
[54:13.490 --> 54:15.490]  type of place for so many of those to
[54:15.630 --> 54:17.630]  grow. It seems like over the years
[54:17.630 --> 54:19.630]  people are squishing that kind of stuff.
[54:19.630 --> 54:21.630]  The leaves are breaking down.
[54:21.630 --> 54:23.630]  It's just
[54:23.630 --> 54:25.630]  better than finding money in a way if
[54:25.630 --> 54:27.630]  you're a farmer because you're going to be able
[54:27.630 --> 54:29.630]  to improve that system
[54:29.630 --> 54:31.630]  knowing in the future. That's something else I don't
[54:31.630 --> 54:33.630]  think a lot of individuals
[54:33.630 --> 54:35.630]  I don't really hear them talking about
[54:35.630 --> 54:37.630]  that. It's like what's your end game?
[54:37.630 --> 54:39.630]  Year one, what are you
[54:39.630 --> 54:41.630]  doing? Year two, year three.
[54:41.630 --> 54:43.630]  I know that you got a lot going on, especially
[54:43.770 --> 54:45.770]  with the plant gods. I know that's year one
[54:45.770 --> 54:47.770]  for you trying to figure stuff out.
[54:47.770 --> 54:49.770]  You need to understand what genetics you're running.
[54:49.770 --> 54:51.770]  These need to be chess moves.
[54:51.770 --> 54:53.770]  I think a lot of individuals
[54:53.770 --> 54:55.770]  things get kind of brought up or blow up
[54:55.770 --> 54:57.770]  in their face where if you would have just kind of
[54:57.770 --> 54:59.770]  thought that out.
[54:59.770 --> 55:01.770]  If you're brand new to this, realize at some point
[55:01.770 --> 55:03.770]  you are going to get kicked in the teeth with some
[55:03.770 --> 55:05.770]  kind of IPM problem. Just know that
[55:05.770 --> 55:07.770]  that's going to happen to you.
[55:07.770 --> 55:09.770]  If you're year one or year two
[55:09.770 --> 55:11.770]  and you're starting to get a little cocky like,
[55:11.910 --> 55:13.910]  you know, plant gods or however you want to view that
[55:13.910 --> 55:15.910]  is like, oh yeah, all right, here's some
[55:15.910 --> 55:17.910]  Russet mites or here's something you've never even heard of
[55:17.910 --> 55:19.910]  before that you might not even know how to
[55:19.910 --> 55:21.910]  take care of until the entire system
[55:21.910 --> 55:23.910]  is wiped out.
[55:23.910 --> 55:25.910]  Having the due diligence to stay
[55:25.910 --> 55:27.910]  kind of in the forefront of learning
[55:27.910 --> 55:29.910]  from the community and then having
[55:29.910 --> 55:31.910]  the time if you really want to get into
[55:31.910 --> 55:33.910]  spending extra time with your plants,
[55:33.910 --> 55:35.910]  it should be kind of scoping those leaves, especially
[55:35.910 --> 55:37.910]  when you're newer to this and finding potential
[55:37.910 --> 55:39.910]  problems so that you can minimize that.
[55:40.050 --> 55:42.050]  And I think that's the key to identifying success
[55:42.050 --> 55:44.050]  is minimizing the problems so that you never
[55:44.050 --> 55:46.050]  have an entire flip that is just
[55:46.050 --> 55:48.050]  completely wiped out because
[55:48.050 --> 55:50.050]  that is hard to overcome
[55:50.050 --> 55:52.050]  if you are self-funded because usually
[55:52.050 --> 55:54.050]  you've put so much money into all the brand new
[55:54.050 --> 55:56.050]  equipment, you're kind of pushing
[55:56.050 --> 55:58.050]  that edge as a human being on
[55:58.050 --> 56:00.050]  where you feel comfortable with
[56:00.050 --> 56:02.050]  where your money's at.
[56:02.050 --> 56:04.050]  I think a lot of us have taken
[56:04.050 --> 56:06.050]  risks like that and failed miserably
[56:06.050 --> 56:08.050]  because we thought we were putting plants
[56:08.190 --> 56:10.190]  in a lot of places and all of a sudden we're going to have high-end
[56:10.190 --> 56:12.190]  apartments and fancy cars and nothing's
[56:12.190 --> 56:14.190]  further from the truth. There's no real
[56:14.190 --> 56:16.190]  glitzy
[56:16.190 --> 56:18.190]  financial success with
[56:18.190 --> 56:20.190]  farming anymore. I think those
[56:20.190 --> 56:22.190]  days are over with. So this is more of
[56:22.190 --> 56:24.190]  labor of love, medicinal value
[56:24.190 --> 56:26.190]  and if you grow good things I think
[56:26.190 --> 56:28.190]  you should be rewarded for that.
[56:28.190 --> 56:30.190]  But yeah, there's no
[56:30.190 --> 56:32.190]  it's not like how it used to
[56:32.190 --> 56:34.190]  be where individuals are telling me they can get
[56:34.190 --> 56:36.190]  like $3,500 and it
[56:36.330 --> 56:38.330]  seems like those days are gone
[56:38.330 --> 56:40.330]  across the country.
[56:40.330 --> 56:42.330]  Unless maybe New York or something but very
[56:42.330 --> 56:44.330]  rare
[56:44.330 --> 56:46.330]  that those numbers even exist.
[56:48.330 --> 56:50.330]  Two and under
[56:50.330 --> 56:52.330]  man, shit. Seventeen
[56:52.330 --> 56:54.330]  sometimes, you know what I mean?
[56:54.330 --> 56:56.330]  It's crazy these days. It's wild out there.
[56:56.330 --> 56:58.330]  Yeah, they say now it's a thousand, eight hundred.
[56:58.330 --> 57:00.330]  I mean it really depends.
[57:00.330 --> 57:02.330]  Wow, that quality.
[57:02.330 --> 57:04.330]  Again, like in Texas and stuff
[57:04.470 --> 57:06.470]  like no offense to your state buddy
[57:06.470 --> 57:08.470]  but I'm afraid of that place.
[57:08.470 --> 57:10.470]  If we were mapping out a situation
[57:10.470 --> 57:12.470]  best believe we would take another three
[57:12.470 --> 57:14.470]  hours to make sure we don't go anywhere
[57:14.470 --> 57:16.470]  near that. I mean that
[57:16.470 --> 57:18.470]  you just have to respect the ops.
[57:18.470 --> 57:20.470]  You know, you got to understand that
[57:20.470 --> 57:22.470]  sometimes it's worth taking extra
[57:22.470 --> 57:24.470]  time so that you can
[57:24.470 --> 57:26.470]  minimize risk and no matter what you're
[57:26.470 --> 57:28.470]  doing, especially if you're farming,
[57:28.470 --> 57:30.470]  you got to minimize that risk from day one
[57:30.470 --> 57:32.470]  or you might blow up
[57:32.610 --> 57:34.610]  your own grow not even realizing
[57:34.610 --> 57:36.610]  it because you
[57:36.610 --> 57:38.610]  you know, especially
[57:38.610 --> 57:40.610]  it's more like the spider mites. I think russet mites
[57:40.610 --> 57:42.610]  I don't know. Is that still plaguing?
[57:42.610 --> 57:44.610]  Like does that plague Texas and Virginia?
[57:46.610 --> 57:48.610]  I haven't seen anybody
[57:48.610 --> 57:50.610]  with russets yet.
[57:50.610 --> 57:52.610]  Russets or spider because I feel like spider is like
[57:52.610 --> 57:54.610]  oh shit but then you figure out alright
[57:54.610 --> 57:56.610]  I mean it sucks but it's not
[57:56.610 --> 57:58.610]  a career ending if you will.
[57:58.610 --> 58:00.610]  Spider is a par for the course.
[58:00.750 --> 58:02.750]  If you don't get spiders
[58:02.750 --> 58:04.750]  it's just stripes. You know, you got thrips
[58:04.750 --> 58:06.750]  you probably get them all
[58:06.750 --> 58:08.750]  to be honest especially if you're
[58:08.750 --> 58:10.750]  hanging out with other growers
[58:10.750 --> 58:12.750]  and stuff. I think that's almost inevitable as well.
[58:12.750 --> 58:14.750]  I'm not seeing
[58:14.750 --> 58:16.750]  russets here yet. Definitely
[58:16.750 --> 58:18.750]  seen spider mites. Obviously a lot of thrips
[58:18.750 --> 58:20.750]  but no russets. Thank goodness.
[58:20.750 --> 58:22.750]  I haven't seen those in a while.
[58:22.750 --> 58:24.750]  Yeah, I haven't seen a VA
[58:24.750 --> 58:26.750]  hollering russets
[58:26.750 --> 58:28.750]  thankfully.
[58:28.890 --> 58:30.890]  And you know
[58:30.890 --> 58:32.890]  probably with the way that you guys are so proactive
[58:32.890 --> 58:34.890]  you know that's the real beauty of it
[58:34.890 --> 58:36.890]  is if there was something that potentially
[58:36.890 --> 58:38.890]  did happen more than likely
[58:38.890 --> 58:40.890]  the life that you built
[58:40.890 --> 58:42.890]  found a way to take care of it.
[58:44.890 --> 58:46.890]  And you gotta have that observation
[58:46.890 --> 58:48.890]  too. You know like I never
[58:48.890 --> 58:50.890]  had russets but I know
[58:50.890 --> 58:52.890]  my buddy Resin Ranch Tim
[58:52.890 --> 58:54.890]  he had a little stint with them and he
[58:54.890 --> 58:56.890]  was, he did great at teaching
[58:57.030 --> 58:59.030]  us like hey man this is where they start
[58:59.030 --> 59:01.030]  out at. Like where the petiole and
[59:01.030 --> 59:03.030]  the leaves meet right there. He said
[59:03.030 --> 59:05.030]  be very observant right there.
[59:05.030 --> 59:07.030]  So that's just something I added to my
[59:07.030 --> 59:09.030]  visual you know IPM.
[59:09.030 --> 59:11.030]  I'm checking in there and obviously
[59:11.030 --> 59:13.030]  for color and everything else.
[59:15.030 --> 59:17.030]  You got any tips
[59:17.030 --> 59:19.030]  or tricks with spider mites
[59:19.030 --> 59:21.030]  Sheldon? I mean that's another one
[59:21.030 --> 59:23.030]  if you're a beginner that's kind of like a russet
[59:23.030 --> 59:25.030]  mite. You know especially
[59:25.170 --> 59:27.170]  if you're not on top of things. If you see webbing
[59:27.170 --> 59:29.170]  in a way it's kind of like
[59:29.170 --> 59:31.170]  shame on you. You should have been paying attention a little bit more.
[59:31.170 --> 59:33.170]  You know that's been around for a little while.
[59:33.170 --> 59:35.170]  But if you do see webbing that's sometimes when
[59:35.170 --> 59:37.170]  people start to notice it. That's
[59:37.170 --> 59:39.170]  a utopia. So you need to address
[59:39.170 --> 59:41.170]  it as such. I mean
[59:41.170 --> 59:43.170]  there's a lot that
[59:43.170 --> 59:45.170]  you need to, a lot of
[59:45.170 --> 59:47.170]  steps you need to take to kind of
[59:47.170 --> 59:49.170]  combat that from that day
[59:49.170 --> 59:51.170]  and probably moving forward for the rest of
[59:51.170 --> 59:53.170]  your grow life. You need to just assume
[59:53.310 --> 59:55.310]  that you have those from that point on.
[59:55.310 --> 59:57.310]  Do your due
[59:57.310 --> 59:59.310]  diligence man. Preventative
[59:59.310 --> 01:00:01.310]  maintenance.
[01:00:01.310 --> 01:00:03.310]  A weekly spray
[01:00:03.310 --> 01:00:05.310]  like when I'm on my
[01:00:05.310 --> 01:00:07.310]  shit I'm spraying once a
[01:00:07.310 --> 01:00:09.310]  week. At least
[01:00:09.310 --> 01:00:11.310]  like a maintenance solution FPJ, vinegar, OHN.
[01:00:11.310 --> 01:00:13.310]  If you're staying on top of that your plants
[01:00:13.310 --> 01:00:15.310]  should be maintaining health
[01:00:15.310 --> 01:00:17.310]  pretty well. You know especially
[01:00:17.310 --> 01:00:19.310]  if you've got good biology in your
[01:00:19.310 --> 01:00:21.310]  soil and everything. I've noticed
[01:00:21.450 --> 01:00:23.450]  that if I stay on top of my
[01:00:23.450 --> 01:00:25.450]  weekly sprays, not even like IPM
[01:00:25.450 --> 01:00:27.450]  sprays, just a maintenance solution or you know what have you.
[01:00:27.450 --> 01:00:29.450]  I don't
[01:00:29.450 --> 01:00:31.450]  have pest issues. I don't have
[01:00:31.450 --> 01:00:33.450]  like powdery mildew issues or anything.
[01:00:35.450 --> 01:00:37.450]  The other huge factor
[01:00:37.450 --> 01:00:39.450]  especially for indoor growers and such. You
[01:00:39.450 --> 01:00:41.450]  don't have the benefit of nature having
[01:00:41.450 --> 01:00:43.450]  predators coming in and you know doing the check
[01:00:43.450 --> 01:00:45.450]  and balance as you're building an ecosystem.
[01:00:45.450 --> 01:00:47.450]  You're limited to your ecosystem inside.
[01:00:47.590 --> 01:00:49.590]  Your environment
[01:00:49.590 --> 01:00:51.590]  is crucial. A lot of times
[01:00:51.590 --> 01:00:53.590]  it's really dry environments.
[01:00:53.590 --> 01:00:55.590]  Dry and that
[01:00:55.590 --> 01:00:57.590]  if you've got one or two in there
[01:00:57.590 --> 01:00:59.590]  that's all it takes. They tend to really
[01:00:59.590 --> 01:01:01.590]  take over
[01:01:01.590 --> 01:01:03.590]  in those instances.
[01:01:03.590 --> 01:01:05.590]  Unhealthy plants.
[01:01:05.590 --> 01:01:07.590]  Grow healthy plants. Take care of your
[01:01:07.590 --> 01:01:09.590]  soil. Make the soil your focus.
[01:01:09.590 --> 01:01:11.590]  Good plants come from that.
[01:01:11.590 --> 01:01:13.590]  Just do your
[01:01:13.590 --> 01:01:15.590]  due diligence and being observant.
[01:01:15.730 --> 01:01:17.730]  Knowing what your tools are
[01:01:17.730 --> 01:01:19.730]  and how to use them.
[01:01:21.730 --> 01:01:23.730]  Good call.
[01:01:23.730 --> 01:01:25.730]  I like for spiders
[01:01:25.730 --> 01:01:27.730]  I like to in-veg
[01:01:27.730 --> 01:01:29.730]  which I don't do a long veg but I can
[01:01:29.730 --> 01:01:31.730]  foliar about two times.
[01:01:31.730 --> 01:01:33.730]  I'll do FAA. I'll do
[01:01:33.730 --> 01:01:35.730]  some surfactants, soap nut,
[01:01:35.730 --> 01:01:37.730]  Q-Wet that I make
[01:01:37.730 --> 01:01:39.730]  and aloe.
[01:01:39.730 --> 01:01:41.730]  That FAA to me though
[01:01:41.730 --> 01:01:43.730]  is key man with the mites.
[01:01:43.870 --> 01:01:45.870]  I feel like it's
[01:01:45.870 --> 01:01:47.870]  a really good
[01:01:47.870 --> 01:01:49.870]  protection.
[01:01:49.870 --> 01:01:51.870]  It coats those leaves.
[01:01:51.870 --> 01:01:53.870]  I think the biggest thing with spider mites and I've seen
[01:01:53.870 --> 01:01:55.870]  my buddies some of their grows
[01:01:55.870 --> 01:01:57.870]  on what they share on Instagram.
[01:01:57.870 --> 01:01:59.870]  A lot of people don't catch
[01:01:59.870 --> 01:02:01.870]  early enough with spider mites and thrips
[01:02:01.870 --> 01:02:03.870]  is that small speckling
[01:02:03.870 --> 01:02:05.870]  on the leaves. It might just be on
[01:02:05.870 --> 01:02:07.870]  one corner or one leaf.
[01:02:07.870 --> 01:02:09.870]  Lower. You've got to be
[01:02:09.870 --> 01:02:11.870]  diligent about that because what will happen is
[01:02:12.010 --> 01:02:14.010]  now you left that one speck
[01:02:14.010 --> 01:02:16.010]  on that one leaf. Lower. It's in there.
[01:02:16.010 --> 01:02:18.010]  They're going to keep
[01:02:18.010 --> 01:02:20.010]  spreading throughout that whole flower
[01:02:20.010 --> 01:02:22.010]  and if you're unlucky
[01:02:22.010 --> 01:02:24.010]  or if your timing's bad enough
[01:02:24.010 --> 01:02:26.010]  that's when you end up with that webbing
[01:02:26.010 --> 01:02:28.010]  because all of a sudden you're like boom.
[01:02:28.010 --> 01:02:30.010]  Where'd I get webbing from? Well it's because
[01:02:30.010 --> 01:02:32.010]  you didn't notice all that little speckling
[01:02:32.010 --> 01:02:34.010]  on those little leaves. So what I do in veg
[01:02:34.010 --> 01:02:36.010]  is I'm very meticulous.
[01:02:36.010 --> 01:02:38.010]  I look for that and pinch the whole
[01:02:38.010 --> 01:02:40.010]  leaf off. If you see that little
[01:02:40.150 --> 01:02:42.150]  cluster with little white speckles on one
[01:02:42.150 --> 01:02:44.150]  little tip of one leaf, take the whole leaf.
[01:02:44.150 --> 01:02:46.150]  Go through there. Take that whole
[01:02:46.150 --> 01:02:48.150]  all of them off. Now foliar
[01:02:48.150 --> 01:02:50.150]  with your FAA
[01:02:50.150 --> 01:02:52.150]  and to me that's usually
[01:02:52.150 --> 01:02:54.150]  fine. That gets you all
[01:02:54.150 --> 01:02:56.150]  the way through. Flower, no webbing
[01:02:56.150 --> 01:02:58.150]  no issues with the spider mites. But it is
[01:02:58.150 --> 01:03:00.150]  something about them man. It's kind of a
[01:03:00.150 --> 01:03:02.150]  bitch. They're always
[01:03:02.150 --> 01:03:04.150]  waiting. They're always in
[01:03:04.150 --> 01:03:06.150]  wait. Waiting for that opportunity
[01:03:06.150 --> 01:03:08.150]  to kind of explode on you.
[01:03:08.290 --> 01:03:10.290]  And once you see them you'll start to
[01:03:10.290 --> 01:03:12.290]  know them like in nature and like
[01:03:12.290 --> 01:03:14.290]  more like landscape
[01:03:14.290 --> 01:03:16.290]  parks where kids are and that kind of stuff.
[01:03:16.290 --> 01:03:18.290]  You'll see them in the summertime.
[01:03:18.290 --> 01:03:20.290]  So again it's pretty easy to pick
[01:03:20.290 --> 01:03:22.290]  those up. And I think they
[01:03:22.290 --> 01:03:24.290]  you know like Marco's mentioned
[01:03:24.290 --> 01:03:26.290]  on the lower leaves they'll also start to kind of
[01:03:26.290 --> 01:03:28.290]  claw up if you will and maybe look like a
[01:03:28.290 --> 01:03:30.290]  deficiency before that
[01:03:30.290 --> 01:03:32.290]  utopia is built up. So
[01:03:32.290 --> 01:03:34.290]  same thing with russets and with
[01:03:34.290 --> 01:03:36.290]  spiders. I mean you kind of want to already have a trained
[01:03:36.430 --> 01:03:38.430]  eye and if you don't have a trained eye then maybe
[01:03:38.430 --> 01:03:40.430]  spend a little time on YouTube
[01:03:40.430 --> 01:03:42.430]  and kind of understand what
[01:03:42.430 --> 01:03:44.430]  the plant looks like and stuff so that you can educate
[01:03:44.430 --> 01:03:46.430]  yourself. I think minimizing
[01:03:46.430 --> 01:03:48.430]  those things is honestly how
[01:03:48.430 --> 01:03:50.430]  you would earn major stripes as a new
[01:03:50.430 --> 01:03:52.430]  farmer. It's protecting the plant from
[01:03:52.430 --> 01:03:54.430]  something major like that. Riding that
[01:03:54.430 --> 01:03:56.430]  wave and coming through on the other end and
[01:03:56.430 --> 01:03:58.430]  having a successful harvest. I mean that's
[01:03:58.430 --> 01:04:00.430]  when you would pat yourself on the back and be like
[01:04:00.430 --> 01:04:02.430]  alright. I think I can really
[01:04:02.430 --> 01:04:04.430]  handle these kind of things. Because that stuff's gonna come
[01:04:04.570 --> 01:04:06.570]  out. You know once
[01:04:06.570 --> 01:04:08.570]  you start to scale up. So if you're in a tent
[01:04:08.570 --> 01:04:10.570]  you know you manage that success. You
[01:04:10.570 --> 01:04:12.570]  have that success and that skill set.
[01:04:12.570 --> 01:04:14.570]  Then if you go to like a larger
[01:04:14.570 --> 01:04:16.570]  even larger tent in the basement and then you go to
[01:04:16.570 --> 01:04:18.570]  like a full basement grow.
[01:04:18.570 --> 01:04:20.570]  All of that stuff
[01:04:20.570 --> 01:04:22.570]  requires almost like another set of
[01:04:22.570 --> 01:04:24.570]  skills. And if you understand that from day one
[01:04:24.570 --> 01:04:26.570]  that's why I've always kind of said
[01:04:26.570 --> 01:04:28.570]  like if you're trying to go from you don't
[01:04:28.570 --> 01:04:30.570]  know anything to a professional
[01:04:30.570 --> 01:04:32.570]  as in you're growing commercially that's a four
[01:04:32.710 --> 01:04:34.710]  year commitment. Just like kind of anything else.
[01:04:34.710 --> 01:04:36.710]  So if you're successful in year one
[01:04:36.710 --> 01:04:38.710]  more than likely you're gonna
[01:04:38.710 --> 01:04:40.710]  find issues and problems
[01:04:40.710 --> 01:04:42.710]  within those next three years. And that's
[01:04:42.710 --> 01:04:44.710]  where you're gonna earn your stripes and be able to really
[01:04:44.710 --> 01:04:46.710]  find true success. Because you've
[01:04:46.710 --> 01:04:48.710]  experienced the downfalls
[01:04:48.710 --> 01:04:50.710]  of what's really around
[01:04:50.710 --> 01:04:52.710]  the corner sometimes. Especially in the larger
[01:04:52.710 --> 01:04:54.710]  facilities that aren't going to be able
[01:04:54.710 --> 01:04:56.710]  to be as airtight as you
[01:04:56.710 --> 01:04:58.710]  would like as a farmer. You know. And to get
[01:04:58.710 --> 01:05:00.710]  the suits to pay for some of that stuff maybe that costs
[01:05:00.850 --> 01:05:02.850]  too much. So you just kind of got to roll with it
[01:05:02.850 --> 01:05:04.850]  and realize that your skill set
[01:05:04.850 --> 01:05:06.850]  your skill set is
[01:05:06.850 --> 01:05:08.850]  hindrance on understanding
[01:05:08.850 --> 01:05:10.850]  Mother Nature and how to combat Mother Nature
[01:05:10.850 --> 01:05:12.850]  using those principles
[01:05:12.850 --> 01:05:14.850]  and protocols. So that's paramount to
[01:05:14.850 --> 01:05:16.850]  understand IPM.
[01:05:16.850 --> 01:05:18.850]  Another tip on IPM too
[01:05:18.850 --> 01:05:20.850]  is I like the predatory mites
[01:05:20.850 --> 01:05:22.850]  but they get in your pockets man.
[01:05:22.850 --> 01:05:24.850]  Damn. I hate having to spend on them.
[01:05:24.850 --> 01:05:26.850]  But I will. Like if I get an issue
[01:05:26.850 --> 01:05:28.850]  with some spider mites I will
[01:05:28.990 --> 01:05:30.990]  go ahead and pop for those
[01:05:30.990 --> 01:05:32.990]  predatory mites.
[01:05:32.990 --> 01:05:34.990]  One thing to remember
[01:05:34.990 --> 01:05:36.990]  though. You got to read the descriptions
[01:05:36.990 --> 01:05:38.990]  on your predatory mites because you got
[01:05:38.990 --> 01:05:40.990]  to match your environment. Like some of them
[01:05:40.990 --> 01:05:42.990]  are only good for low humidity. Some
[01:05:42.990 --> 01:05:44.990]  of them work better in high humidity.
[01:05:44.990 --> 01:05:46.990]  So depending on how your
[01:05:46.990 --> 01:05:48.990]  grow is set up make sure you're getting the right ones.
[01:05:48.990 --> 01:05:50.990]  Man I've
[01:05:50.990 --> 01:05:52.990]  had spider mites. Go ahead.
[01:05:52.990 --> 01:05:54.990]  I was just going to say those are bars because the only
[01:05:54.990 --> 01:05:56.990]  person I've ever heard say that
[01:05:57.130 --> 01:05:59.130]  is Mariah LaChapelle.
[01:05:59.130 --> 01:06:01.130]  Where you're talking about somebody
[01:06:01.130 --> 01:06:03.130]  that could benefit from. Yeah you got
[01:06:03.130 --> 01:06:05.130]  to buy them all.
[01:06:05.130 --> 01:06:07.130]  At the beginning that's how everybody
[01:06:07.130 --> 01:06:09.130]  is. Diversity is king.
[01:06:09.130 --> 01:06:11.130]  But if they can't survive
[01:06:11.130 --> 01:06:13.130]  then I mean obviously that's silly.
[01:06:13.130 --> 01:06:15.130]  So yeah. Doing your homework before you
[01:06:15.130 --> 01:06:17.130]  spend a good amount
[01:06:17.130 --> 01:06:19.130]  of money is paramount as
[01:06:19.130 --> 01:06:21.130]  just a human being.
[01:06:21.130 --> 01:06:23.130]  Taking the time to understand this stuff
[01:06:23.130 --> 01:06:25.130]  and then you're going to obviously as the
[01:06:25.270 --> 01:06:27.270]  months go by and years go by you're going to start
[01:06:27.270 --> 01:06:29.270]  making more money for yourself. And that's
[01:06:29.270 --> 01:06:31.270]  something else that I think is pretty cool
[01:06:31.270 --> 01:06:33.270]  that maybe the community might need to keep
[01:06:33.270 --> 01:06:35.270]  to themselves away from the suits.
[01:06:35.270 --> 01:06:37.270]  If you do dial this in you're going to find
[01:06:37.270 --> 01:06:39.270]  more monetary success
[01:06:39.270 --> 01:06:41.270]  because of you're thinking in the future.
[01:06:41.270 --> 01:06:43.270]  You're building things out. You're really
[01:06:43.270 --> 01:06:45.270]  starting to improve things.
[01:06:45.270 --> 01:06:47.270]  Your eye is on the prize a year from now.
[01:06:47.270 --> 01:06:49.270]  Two years from now. Most cannabis
[01:06:49.270 --> 01:06:51.270]  farmers that's not
[01:06:51.270 --> 01:06:53.270]  it's the next flip and maybe a flip
[01:06:53.410 --> 01:06:55.410]  after. So I encourage
[01:06:55.410 --> 01:06:57.410]  you guys to really think these things out a year
[01:06:57.410 --> 01:06:59.410]  ahead. Maybe two years ahead.
[01:06:59.410 --> 01:07:01.410]  And you'll find so much better success
[01:07:01.410 --> 01:07:03.410]  by thinking that way.
[01:07:03.410 --> 01:07:05.410]  Almost kind of like what do they call that
[01:07:05.410 --> 01:07:07.410]  30,000 square foot view or whatever
[01:07:07.410 --> 01:07:09.410]  in business.
[01:07:09.410 --> 01:07:11.410]  Yeah.
[01:07:11.410 --> 01:07:13.410]  Yeah. They say yeah.
[01:07:13.410 --> 01:07:15.410]  Taking that from that high view
[01:07:15.410 --> 01:07:17.410]  and what you want to do is
[01:07:17.410 --> 01:07:19.410]  get on down and get that view on down
[01:07:19.410 --> 01:07:21.410]  the ground level so you can spot
[01:07:21.550 --> 01:07:23.550]  the test. But definitely man
[01:07:23.550 --> 01:07:25.550]  valid points
[01:07:25.550 --> 01:07:27.550]  Brian. People got to understand it.
[01:07:27.550 --> 01:07:29.550]  That year one year it
[01:07:29.550 --> 01:07:31.550]  can be a special year. Sometimes that's
[01:07:31.550 --> 01:07:33.550]  just you just did great. Things
[01:07:33.550 --> 01:07:35.550]  all happen and it all worked out
[01:07:35.550 --> 01:07:37.550]  wonderfully. But don't get cocky with it.
[01:07:37.550 --> 01:07:39.550]  You know what I mean? Stay diligent. Even to this
[01:07:39.550 --> 01:07:41.550]  day man you're not
[01:07:41.550 --> 01:07:43.550]  you're one issue
[01:07:43.550 --> 01:07:45.550]  away from losing a crop at any
[01:07:45.550 --> 01:07:47.550]  given time. So you got to kind of stay
[01:07:47.550 --> 01:07:49.550]  diligent. I love
[01:07:49.690 --> 01:07:51.690]  living soil though. It's so forgiving.
[01:07:51.690 --> 01:07:53.690]  You know what I mean? Like as far as the
[01:07:53.690 --> 01:07:55.690]  large heavy weight beds.
[01:07:55.690 --> 01:07:57.690]  We got a group chat
[01:07:57.690 --> 01:07:59.690]  and I sent a picture to some of the
[01:07:59.690 --> 01:08:01.690]  guys. None of them are growers.
[01:08:01.690 --> 01:08:03.690]  My peers. And
[01:08:03.690 --> 01:08:05.690]  basically they were like man that's a big ass
[01:08:05.690 --> 01:08:07.690]  pot. You know. And my response
[01:08:07.690 --> 01:08:09.690]  was the soil is the stomach
[01:08:09.690 --> 01:08:11.690]  of the plant. And they were
[01:08:11.690 --> 01:08:13.690]  that just blew their mind. Like
[01:08:13.690 --> 01:08:15.690]  and I thought of course I thought about you when
[01:08:15.690 --> 01:08:17.690]  I said that Brian. But you know that blew
[01:08:17.830 --> 01:08:19.830]  their mind. And then they all said damn
[01:08:19.830 --> 01:08:21.830]  this is non-plant people. And then they were
[01:08:21.830 --> 01:08:23.830]  like you know like damn 100.
[01:08:23.830 --> 01:08:25.830]  That's dope. You know I like that. So
[01:08:25.830 --> 01:08:27.830]  things like that just give people
[01:08:27.830 --> 01:08:29.830]  you know a different perspective. But yeah
[01:08:29.830 --> 01:08:31.830]  man the high volume of soil
[01:08:31.830 --> 01:08:33.830]  is key. Sometimes you can get a little
[01:08:33.830 --> 01:08:35.830]  bit of pest action with the
[01:08:35.830 --> 01:08:37.830]  fungus gnats and things like that.
[01:08:37.830 --> 01:08:39.830]  But you know that's stuff that you kind of
[01:08:39.830 --> 01:08:41.830]  grow on through and work on through.
[01:08:41.830 --> 01:08:43.830]  You know fungus gnats are annoying as hell.
[01:08:43.830 --> 01:08:45.830]  And usually you're
[01:08:45.970 --> 01:08:47.970]  going to get a bloom of them at some point
[01:08:47.970 --> 01:08:49.970]  during your living soil process.
[01:08:49.970 --> 01:08:51.970]  Usually at the beginning. You know that's why
[01:08:51.970 --> 01:08:53.970]  it's good to kind of load your soils
[01:08:53.970 --> 01:08:55.970]  water them in with some BTI
[01:08:55.970 --> 01:08:57.970]  things like that. That can help
[01:08:57.970 --> 01:08:59.970]  you you know kind of get that
[01:08:59.970 --> 01:09:01.970]  keep that from blooming.
[01:09:01.970 --> 01:09:03.970]  Rove beetles are a great sign.
[01:09:03.970 --> 01:09:05.970]  You know like MI beneficials
[01:09:05.970 --> 01:09:07.970]  great source for roves. I
[01:09:07.970 --> 01:09:09.970]  grab this stuff. Throw it in my soil.
[01:09:09.970 --> 01:09:11.970]  Rove beetles are one that
[01:09:11.970 --> 01:09:13.970]  it's a good bang
[01:09:14.110 --> 01:09:16.110]  for your buck because they stay around for the
[01:09:16.110 --> 01:09:18.110]  most part. You know you can usually dig down
[01:09:18.110 --> 01:09:20.110]  under your mulch layer or whatever
[01:09:20.110 --> 01:09:22.110]  and still see roves running around. Whereas
[01:09:22.110 --> 01:09:24.110]  some of the mites man
[01:09:24.110 --> 01:09:26.110]  are like the predatory stuff
[01:09:26.110 --> 01:09:28.110]  you got to be like it's hit and miss
[01:09:28.110 --> 01:09:30.110]  sometimes. You got to have good timing.
[01:09:30.110 --> 01:09:32.110]  You got to have good environment.
[01:09:32.110 --> 01:09:34.110]  And you know and the thing
[01:09:34.110 --> 01:09:36.110]  with mites you want to have a
[01:09:36.110 --> 01:09:38.110]  actually a source of food for them.
[01:09:38.110 --> 01:09:40.110]  So if I do see some
[01:09:40.110 --> 01:09:42.110]  spider mites I won't go
[01:09:42.250 --> 01:09:44.250]  I won't like foliar and try to knock
[01:09:44.250 --> 01:09:46.250]  them down. What I'll do is I'll go ahead and order my
[01:09:46.250 --> 01:09:48.250]  predators. Release them
[01:09:48.250 --> 01:09:50.250]  and then go for that specific
[01:09:50.250 --> 01:09:52.250]  period of time. And then after that period
[01:09:52.250 --> 01:09:54.250]  of time then I may foliar
[01:09:54.250 --> 01:09:56.250]  again and kind of knock down whoever
[01:09:56.250 --> 01:09:58.250]  is left. You know so
[01:09:58.250 --> 01:10:00.250]  it's all about timing man and
[01:10:00.250 --> 01:10:02.250]  you know using what you got
[01:10:02.250 --> 01:10:04.250]  available to you. I wish I could get some damn
[01:10:04.250 --> 01:10:06.250]  mites to just kind of keep
[01:10:06.250 --> 01:10:08.250]  growing and culture. I know that's
[01:10:08.250 --> 01:10:10.250]  a tough process but if anybody's out
[01:10:10.390 --> 01:10:12.390]  there doing that definitely reach out to
[01:10:12.390 --> 01:10:14.390]  me because that's
[01:10:14.390 --> 01:10:16.390]  something I'm tired of buying.
[01:10:16.390 --> 01:10:18.390]  Yeah it almost seems like that's
[01:10:18.390 --> 01:10:20.390]  maybe the last
[01:10:20.390 --> 01:10:22.390]  one of the last few things I guess that you would have to
[01:10:22.390 --> 01:10:24.390]  buy once you start to dial in all
[01:10:24.390 --> 01:10:26.390]  of these protocols
[01:10:26.390 --> 01:10:28.390]  because it is extremely hard to get
[01:10:28.390 --> 01:10:30.390]  the predators to live when
[01:10:30.390 --> 01:10:32.390]  you don't have an issue. So there's
[01:10:32.390 --> 01:10:34.390]  that catch 22. So you're spending a little more money
[01:10:34.390 --> 01:10:36.390]  but you're not having any issues.
[01:10:36.390 --> 01:10:38.390]  Some of the older heads
[01:10:38.530 --> 01:10:40.530]  when I was going to some of these
[01:10:40.530 --> 01:10:42.530]  regen camps and stuff and attending
[01:10:42.530 --> 01:10:44.530]  some online classes and stuff they were
[01:10:44.530 --> 01:10:46.530]  saying that they also think the FAA is because
[01:10:46.530 --> 01:10:48.530]  of the fish oils and stuff. Do you
[01:10:48.530 --> 01:10:50.530]  boys believe that that's
[01:10:50.530 --> 01:10:52.530]  just another thing that you can use as
[01:10:52.530 --> 01:10:54.530]  being proactive. So yes you're using
[01:10:54.530 --> 01:10:56.530]  the predatory
[01:10:56.530 --> 01:10:58.530]  mites and then I would imagine
[01:10:58.530 --> 01:11:00.530]  there's some kind of
[01:11:00.530 --> 01:11:02.530]  protocol where you'd wait a little bit
[01:11:02.530 --> 01:11:04.530]  because the fish oils
[01:11:04.530 --> 01:11:06.530]  would kill both.
[01:11:06.670 --> 01:11:08.670]  Walk us through that process.
[01:11:10.670 --> 01:11:12.670]  The way I use my FAA
[01:11:12.670 --> 01:11:14.670]  is like so I'll have my
[01:11:14.670 --> 01:11:16.670]  plants in my nursery right so now
[01:11:16.670 --> 01:11:18.670]  they're ready to go to bed so I'll get them down to my
[01:11:18.670 --> 01:11:20.670]  living soil beds. Boom we're going
[01:11:20.670 --> 01:11:22.670]  to bed. I go ahead and
[01:11:22.670 --> 01:11:24.670]  foliar right away with the FAA.
[01:11:24.670 --> 01:11:26.670]  And like you said I
[01:11:26.670 --> 01:11:28.670]  feel like on a microscopic
[01:11:28.670 --> 01:11:30.670]  level when you zoom it down
[01:11:30.670 --> 01:11:32.670]  when you get a good coating of FAA
[01:11:32.670 --> 01:11:34.670]  on that leaf surface to me
[01:11:34.810 --> 01:11:36.810]  you got the fish oils which is one
[01:11:36.810 --> 01:11:38.810]  but then you also got all that other microbiology
[01:11:38.810 --> 01:11:40.810]  you know what I mean. It's kind of like
[01:11:40.810 --> 01:11:42.810]  you know like
[01:11:42.810 --> 01:11:44.810]  it forms kind of a
[01:11:44.810 --> 01:11:46.810]  protective shield like you can actually
[01:11:46.810 --> 01:11:48.810]  see the gloss of freaking FAA
[01:11:48.810 --> 01:11:50.810]  the way it looks and I feel like it's
[01:11:50.810 --> 01:11:52.810]  crucial. Got to get both sides
[01:11:52.810 --> 01:11:54.810]  of your leaves any time you're running
[01:11:54.810 --> 01:11:56.810]  some kind of foliar for that purpose
[01:11:56.810 --> 01:11:58.810]  or feed. You always
[01:11:58.810 --> 01:12:00.810]  want to hit both sides of the leaves so it's crucial
[01:12:00.810 --> 01:12:02.810]  to get on both sides. But what I'll do
[01:12:02.950 --> 01:12:04.950]  is so if I don't have pests
[01:12:04.950 --> 01:12:06.950]  or I don't see anything just foliar
[01:12:06.950 --> 01:12:08.950]  FAA
[01:12:08.950 --> 01:12:10.950]  probably twice in my
[01:12:10.950 --> 01:12:12.950]  10 day veg and go on to flower
[01:12:12.950 --> 01:12:14.950]  then I'm good I'll run it on out.
[01:12:14.950 --> 01:12:16.950]  Now if I have an issue in the
[01:12:16.950 --> 01:12:18.950]  nursery and where I'm going into veg
[01:12:18.950 --> 01:12:20.950]  and I already got the mites
[01:12:20.950 --> 01:12:22.950]  then I will FAA
[01:12:22.950 --> 01:12:24.950]  them in the nursery
[01:12:24.950 --> 01:12:26.950]  try to set the stage but then as soon as
[01:12:26.950 --> 01:12:28.950]  I go down to my veg bed I will
[01:12:28.950 --> 01:12:30.950]  go ahead and buy predators. Get
[01:12:31.090 --> 01:12:33.090]  those in there put them on them
[01:12:33.090 --> 01:12:35.090]  and then
[01:12:35.090 --> 01:12:37.090]  I usually wait at least two weeks after
[01:12:37.090 --> 01:12:39.090]  I've released the predators
[01:12:39.090 --> 01:12:41.090]  to come back in if I was going to FAA
[01:12:41.090 --> 01:12:43.090]  again but in my
[01:12:43.090 --> 01:12:45.090]  process I'm only 10 days so
[01:12:45.090 --> 01:12:47.090]  my key is this
[01:12:47.090 --> 01:12:49.090]  I got to get through the run
[01:12:49.090 --> 01:12:51.090]  that's all I need to do each run
[01:12:51.090 --> 01:12:53.090]  get through it so boom veg
[01:12:53.090 --> 01:12:55.090]  no predators no issues I'm gone
[01:12:55.090 --> 01:12:57.090]  but if I got issues I will throw
[01:12:57.090 --> 01:12:59.090]  I will spend with Arbico
[01:12:59.230 --> 01:13:01.230]  one of the big names on the predatory
[01:13:01.230 --> 01:13:03.230]  mites and get them in there
[01:13:03.230 --> 01:13:05.230]  so
[01:13:05.230 --> 01:13:07.230]  but you know like
[01:13:07.230 --> 01:13:09.230]  I'm sorry to cut you off Brian but
[01:13:09.230 --> 01:13:11.230]  the point I was making earlier is all about
[01:13:11.230 --> 01:13:13.230]  making it through the end of flower
[01:13:13.230 --> 01:13:15.230]  now I've been in flower
[01:13:15.230 --> 01:13:17.230]  and I said oh shit I've seen the little
[01:13:17.230 --> 01:13:19.230]  mites are in here and I can't
[01:13:19.230 --> 01:13:21.230]  really do shit but I was close enough to
[01:13:21.230 --> 01:13:23.230]  where I got the flower
[01:13:23.230 --> 01:13:25.230]  that I was able to make it through
[01:13:25.230 --> 01:13:27.230]  now an interesting thing
[01:13:27.370 --> 01:13:29.370]  if you have some spider mites
[01:13:29.370 --> 01:13:31.370]  any on your plant when you chop and hang it
[01:13:31.370 --> 01:13:33.370]  they're going to go to the top
[01:13:33.370 --> 01:13:35.370]  and they will web up on that
[01:13:35.370 --> 01:13:37.370]  top of your stem and
[01:13:37.370 --> 01:13:39.370]  you can go through there and burn them off with a
[01:13:39.370 --> 01:13:41.370]  lighter or whatever but that's something
[01:13:41.370 --> 01:13:43.370]  to notice a lot of people don't notice
[01:13:43.370 --> 01:13:45.370]  that even if you got 10 or 5
[01:13:45.370 --> 01:13:47.370]  mites or whatever it may be on a
[01:13:47.370 --> 01:13:49.370]  plant once you hang it they will
[01:13:49.370 --> 01:13:51.370]  crawl all up to the top tip
[01:13:51.370 --> 01:13:53.370]  and gather up there
[01:13:53.370 --> 01:13:55.370]  kind of weird but it's kind of what
[01:13:55.510 --> 01:13:57.510]  they do I guess that's part of the webbing
[01:13:57.510 --> 01:13:59.510]  they're trying to get to that top tip
[01:13:59.510 --> 01:14:01.510]  now get a breeze and then
[01:14:01.510 --> 01:14:03.510]  go off to find another plant
[01:14:03.510 --> 01:14:05.510]  so yeah if you do
[01:14:05.510 --> 01:14:07.510]  see that just go through there while
[01:14:07.510 --> 01:14:09.510]  your plants are hanging run a little flame
[01:14:09.510 --> 01:14:11.510]  over top of that tip it will burn that webbing
[01:14:11.510 --> 01:14:13.510]  and the mites and you'll be good
[01:14:15.510 --> 01:14:17.510]  it's the FAA for
[01:14:17.510 --> 01:14:19.510]  the mites and stuff is interested like some of
[01:14:19.510 --> 01:14:21.510]  the older like original English translated
[01:14:21.510 --> 01:14:23.510]  literature speaks of
[01:14:23.650 --> 01:14:25.650]  using more oily fishes
[01:14:25.650 --> 01:14:27.650]  to make FAA with because the oil is beneficial
[01:14:27.650 --> 01:14:29.650]  against like white flies and mites
[01:14:29.650 --> 01:14:31.650]  and stuff like that
[01:14:31.650 --> 01:14:33.650]  so yeah it's an interesting thing that
[01:14:33.650 --> 01:14:35.650]  and the using it with
[01:14:35.650 --> 01:14:37.650]  at least vinegar the vinegar
[01:14:37.650 --> 01:14:39.650]  is also like a cleanser you know it kind of
[01:14:39.650 --> 01:14:41.650]  cleanses the cell walls the
[01:14:41.650 --> 01:14:43.650]  leaf surfaces and everything and kind of
[01:14:43.650 --> 01:14:45.650]  creates a perfect environment for that
[01:14:45.650 --> 01:14:47.650]  oil and the goodness of the FAA
[01:14:47.650 --> 01:14:49.650]  and everything that kind of stick to it on a
[01:14:49.650 --> 01:14:51.650]  blank canvas if you will
[01:14:51.790 --> 01:14:53.790]  it's like oh this is you know it cleaned out the trash
[01:14:53.790 --> 01:14:55.790]  now we've built a new you know
[01:14:55.790 --> 01:14:57.790]  beautiful building right here
[01:14:57.790 --> 01:14:59.790]  so that's how I
[01:14:59.790 --> 01:15:01.790]  look at it anyway anytime I'm applying any of these
[01:15:01.790 --> 01:15:03.790]  K&F inputs it's like you're at least
[01:15:03.790 --> 01:15:05.790]  using vinegar you know
[01:15:05.790 --> 01:15:07.790]  and if possible some OHN too
[01:15:07.790 --> 01:15:09.790]  yeah great point see you just
[01:15:09.790 --> 01:15:11.790]  made the point I made earlier like I
[01:15:11.790 --> 01:15:13.790]  always use my vinegar I'm a big
[01:15:13.790 --> 01:15:15.790]  vinegar guy I didn't mention that as part of this
[01:15:15.790 --> 01:15:17.790]  process but I do yeah vinegar
[01:15:17.790 --> 01:15:19.790]  I use vinegar pretty much anytime I'm
[01:15:19.930 --> 01:15:21.930]  going to do anything you know
[01:15:21.930 --> 01:15:23.930]  watering with
[01:15:23.930 --> 01:15:25.930]  any kind of inputs even JLF because I
[01:15:25.930 --> 01:15:27.930]  make so many vinegars you know vinegar
[01:15:27.930 --> 01:15:29.930]  is a great input
[01:15:29.930 --> 01:15:31.930]  man you get the benefit of what the plant
[01:15:31.930 --> 01:15:33.930]  you use to make it and then you get all that
[01:15:33.930 --> 01:15:35.930]  acetic acid bacteria
[01:15:35.930 --> 01:15:37.930]  you know which has broken that plant down
[01:15:37.930 --> 01:15:39.930]  and converts it basically to
[01:15:39.930 --> 01:15:41.930]  you know plant aminos and
[01:15:41.930 --> 01:15:43.930]  you know plant available nutrients so
[01:15:43.930 --> 01:15:45.930]  yeah vinegar is key good point man
[01:15:45.930 --> 01:15:47.930]  just
[01:15:48.070 --> 01:15:50.070]  on the vinegar subject
[01:15:50.070 --> 01:15:52.070]  maybe a way to entice people to start
[01:15:52.070 --> 01:15:54.070]  using vinegar with their inputs
[01:15:54.070 --> 01:15:56.070]  even in the soil
[01:15:56.070 --> 01:15:58.070]  right so if you know how to make like water
[01:15:58.070 --> 01:16:00.070]  soluble calcium for instance it's
[01:16:00.070 --> 01:16:02.070]  vinegar and eggshells
[01:16:02.070 --> 01:16:04.070]  or oyster shells and it
[01:16:04.070 --> 01:16:06.070]  strips the calcium out to a solution right
[01:16:06.070 --> 01:16:08.070]  makes it plant available think about that
[01:16:08.070 --> 01:16:10.070]  if we're every time you know watering
[01:16:10.070 --> 01:16:12.070]  in a solution there's a little bit of vinegar in there
[01:16:12.070 --> 01:16:14.070]  and you've got insoluble
[01:16:14.070 --> 01:16:16.070]  calcium in the soil that hasn't been digested by
[01:16:16.210 --> 01:16:18.210]  microbes or anything yet you're actually chelating
[01:16:18.210 --> 01:16:20.210]  that calcium in place and making it
[01:16:20.210 --> 01:16:22.210]  available to the plant right there in the root zone
[01:16:22.210 --> 01:16:24.210]  a little bit every time
[01:16:24.210 --> 01:16:26.210]  that's a gold bar
[01:16:26.210 --> 01:16:28.210]  that's a bar right there because I never thought about
[01:16:28.210 --> 01:16:30.210]  the vinegar doing that
[01:16:30.210 --> 01:16:32.210]  function as well good shit man
[01:16:34.210 --> 01:16:36.210]  vinegar is one of my favorite inputs in K&F
[01:16:36.210 --> 01:16:38.210]  man honestly it's so simple and
[01:16:38.210 --> 01:16:40.210]  you know super easy to make but it has a lot
[01:16:40.210 --> 01:16:42.210]  of functions that are overlooked
[01:16:42.210 --> 01:16:44.210]  cause you get a free vinegar
[01:16:44.350 --> 01:16:46.350]  with every FPJ or FFJ2
[01:16:46.350 --> 01:16:48.350]  so bro bingo
[01:16:48.350 --> 01:16:50.350]  well and when you're finding success
[01:16:50.350 --> 01:16:52.350]  then taking it to the next level
[01:16:52.350 --> 01:16:54.350]  and focusing on calcium it does
[01:16:54.350 --> 01:16:56.350]  seem like that from that point on you're gonna
[01:16:56.350 --> 01:16:58.350]  be able to kind of find the full expression
[01:16:58.350 --> 01:17:00.350]  of the plants and I think
[01:17:00.350 --> 01:17:02.350]  a lot of us in our earlier days
[01:17:02.350 --> 01:17:04.350]  we just didn't have enough calcium
[01:17:04.350 --> 01:17:06.350]  so we just all the genetics
[01:17:06.350 --> 01:17:08.350]  you know again it was
[01:17:08.350 --> 01:17:10.350]  who knew it was pretty hard to know where your
[01:17:10.350 --> 01:17:12.350]  genetics came from from that point on
[01:17:12.490 --> 01:17:14.490]  so it just felt like we were all growing down
[01:17:14.490 --> 01:17:16.490]  the same watered down genetics
[01:17:16.490 --> 01:17:18.490]  where now individuals are gonna be able to
[01:17:18.490 --> 01:17:20.490]  obviously get their genetics from the source
[01:17:20.490 --> 01:17:22.490]  come home, build their own
[01:17:22.490 --> 01:17:24.490]  soil systems, find success
[01:17:24.490 --> 01:17:26.490]  and then hopefully from that point moving forward
[01:17:26.490 --> 01:17:28.490]  start to play around with a variety of
[01:17:28.490 --> 01:17:30.490]  calciums. I have even found
[01:17:30.490 --> 01:17:32.490]  success, I think I've mentioned
[01:17:32.490 --> 01:17:34.490]  this a couple times Marco when you're saying
[01:17:34.490 --> 01:17:36.490]  you know you add those oyster shell
[01:17:36.490 --> 01:17:38.490]  all over for the isopods
[01:17:38.490 --> 01:17:40.490]  and then the springtails and the isopods
[01:17:40.630 --> 01:17:42.630]  over this will probably take seems like
[01:17:42.630 --> 01:17:44.630]  months you start to see it
[01:17:44.630 --> 01:17:46.630]  starts to very finely start
[01:17:46.630 --> 01:17:48.630]  to thin out so I know that those
[01:17:48.630 --> 01:17:50.630]  things are starting to break down and
[01:17:50.630 --> 01:17:52.630]  if it's really heavy with springtails
[01:17:52.630 --> 01:17:54.630]  they'll actually start to see like a little bit of a
[01:17:54.630 --> 01:17:56.630]  hole in that shell
[01:17:56.630 --> 01:17:58.630]  so there's a lot of stuff going on
[01:17:58.630 --> 01:18:00.630]  that I think is a way to kind of like improve
[01:18:00.630 --> 01:18:02.630]  on that soil system that we've just
[01:18:02.630 --> 01:18:04.630]  started to play around with
[01:18:04.630 --> 01:18:06.630]  so I hope that more individuals
[01:18:06.630 --> 01:18:08.630]  that are you know have the
[01:18:08.770 --> 01:18:10.770]  capacity to kind of play around with stuff
[01:18:10.770 --> 01:18:12.770]  speak up and let us know like what are some of the
[01:18:12.770 --> 01:18:14.770]  cooler things because getting calcium
[01:18:14.770 --> 01:18:16.770]  into any system it seems like
[01:18:16.770 --> 01:18:18.770]  is you know there's nothing
[01:18:18.770 --> 01:18:20.770]  but or back in the day in poker you call that
[01:18:20.770 --> 01:18:22.770]  EV positive meaning it's all equity
[01:18:22.770 --> 01:18:24.770]  positive there's no back side to this
[01:18:24.770 --> 01:18:26.770]  you know we're getting all our money in here
[01:18:26.770 --> 01:18:28.770]  because we understand if we can get
[01:18:28.770 --> 01:18:30.770]  maybe a few more varieties
[01:18:30.770 --> 01:18:32.770]  of calcium into our soil system
[01:18:32.770 --> 01:18:34.770]  even within like a year or so
[01:18:34.770 --> 01:18:36.770]  we're going to find success in the following
[01:18:36.910 --> 01:18:38.910]  years and in my opinion
[01:18:38.910 --> 01:18:40.910]  that is a tried and true thing that I think a lot
[01:18:40.910 --> 01:18:42.910]  of people miss out on when they're first getting into
[01:18:42.910 --> 01:18:44.910]  this they're so focused on like nitrogen
[01:18:44.910 --> 01:18:46.910]  you know some of the earlier
[01:18:46.910 --> 01:18:48.910]  veg things that they need to kind of
[01:18:48.910 --> 01:18:50.910]  hoops that they need to jump through
[01:18:50.910 --> 01:18:52.910]  good point
[01:18:52.910 --> 01:18:54.910]  Brian
[01:18:54.910 --> 01:18:56.910]  yeah you know you think about it like
[01:18:56.910 --> 01:18:58.910]  if you usually veg
[01:18:58.910 --> 01:19:00.910]  is the shortest period of time
[01:19:00.910 --> 01:19:02.910]  you know flowering is where
[01:19:02.910 --> 01:19:04.910]  your plants really taxing your soil
[01:19:05.050 --> 01:19:07.050]  and yeah calcium is huge
[01:19:07.050 --> 01:19:09.050]  I tell you the biggest thing for me
[01:19:09.050 --> 01:19:11.050]  man is the
[01:19:11.050 --> 01:19:13.050]  is the
[01:19:13.050 --> 01:19:15.050]  accessibility to genetics now
[01:19:15.050 --> 01:19:17.050]  that was my biggest hold back
[01:19:17.050 --> 01:19:19.050]  when I was just in my
[01:19:19.050 --> 01:19:21.050]  cave doing my own thing right
[01:19:21.050 --> 01:19:23.050]  I was searching for genetics
[01:19:23.050 --> 01:19:25.050]  I had the concepts
[01:19:25.050 --> 01:19:27.050]  and the growing down
[01:19:27.050 --> 01:19:29.050]  but it was always like damn I thought
[01:19:29.050 --> 01:19:31.050]  this was going to be you know the way you know how
[01:19:31.050 --> 01:19:33.050]  it is how they describe the shit when you're getting
[01:19:33.190 --> 01:19:35.190]  genetics it sounds so good
[01:19:35.190 --> 01:19:37.190]  but now with us
[01:19:37.190 --> 01:19:39.190]  going legal and Instagram I'm able
[01:19:39.190 --> 01:19:41.190]  to go to cats straight up
[01:19:41.190 --> 01:19:43.190]  like genome alchemy
[01:19:43.190 --> 01:19:45.190]  you know
[01:19:45.190 --> 01:19:47.190]  Cab got some cats frozen lemons
[01:19:47.190 --> 01:19:49.190]  like those big dogs
[01:19:49.190 --> 01:19:51.190]  are accessible to people now
[01:19:51.190 --> 01:19:53.190]  now we can kind of see
[01:19:53.190 --> 01:19:55.190]  alright damn genetics coming
[01:19:55.190 --> 01:19:57.190]  together with growers like shit is
[01:19:57.190 --> 01:19:59.190]  being really lovely these days
[01:19:59.190 --> 01:20:01.190]  because man y'all don't realize
[01:20:01.330 --> 01:20:03.330]  it was tough getting genetics
[01:20:03.330 --> 01:20:05.330]  you get a pack of seeds and that shit
[01:20:05.330 --> 01:20:07.330]  you know shit first of all
[01:20:07.330 --> 01:20:09.330]  they were hard to get and then when you
[01:20:09.330 --> 01:20:11.330]  got them you know shit
[01:20:11.330 --> 01:20:13.330]  might turn out to be some bullshit
[01:20:13.330 --> 01:20:15.330]  you know what I mean
[01:20:15.330 --> 01:20:17.330]  like damn I went through all this effort
[01:20:17.330 --> 01:20:19.330]  I think I'm finally going to make it
[01:20:19.330 --> 01:20:21.330]  I got this blueberry or whatever they
[01:20:21.330 --> 01:20:23.330]  called it whatever it was
[01:20:23.330 --> 01:20:25.330]  and then it doesn't turn out you know what I mean
[01:20:25.330 --> 01:20:27.330]  so having the ability to just
[01:20:27.330 --> 01:20:29.330]  go direct to people these days is huge
[01:20:29.470 --> 01:20:31.470]  and I think that's where
[01:20:31.470 --> 01:20:33.470]  natural farming is shining because even
[01:20:33.470 --> 01:20:35.470]  guys that have been on this show like B-Leaf
[01:20:35.470 --> 01:20:37.470]  they'll all tell you like the Turks
[01:20:37.470 --> 01:20:39.470]  they shine with natural farming
[01:20:39.470 --> 01:20:41.470]  and they're in their product
[01:20:41.470 --> 01:20:43.470]  they'll tell you
[01:20:43.470 --> 01:20:45.470]  and that makes me feel good because that makes me feel
[01:20:45.470 --> 01:20:47.470]  like damn we are on the right track
[01:20:47.470 --> 01:20:49.470]  what I already know other people know
[01:20:49.470 --> 01:20:51.470]  too so that's
[01:20:51.470 --> 01:20:53.470]  the benefit of this
[01:20:53.470 --> 01:20:55.470]  calcium is huge man
[01:20:55.470 --> 01:20:57.470]  gotta have that good calcium source
[01:20:59.470 --> 01:21:01.470]  B-Leaf's one of the few dudes
[01:21:01.470 --> 01:21:03.470]  I feel like where he talks about all his
[01:21:03.470 --> 01:21:05.470]  point system and all that
[01:21:05.470 --> 01:21:07.470]  kind of takes like
[01:21:07.470 --> 01:21:09.470]  he obviously has more of that gray
[01:21:09.470 --> 01:21:11.470]  approach and his style
[01:21:11.470 --> 01:21:13.470]  and who he is as a person probably
[01:21:13.470 --> 01:21:15.470]  understands a lot of that world but at
[01:21:15.470 --> 01:21:17.470]  the same time flips it and kind of
[01:21:17.470 --> 01:21:19.470]  to me takes it
[01:21:19.470 --> 01:21:21.470]  as you know I don't
[01:21:21.470 --> 01:21:23.470]  know exactly how that point system works
[01:21:23.470 --> 01:21:25.470]  obviously that's his thing but it
[01:21:25.470 --> 01:21:27.470]  seems like however he's dialed
[01:21:27.610 --> 01:21:29.610]  that in man he picks winners
[01:21:29.610 --> 01:21:31.610]  more than some of the other guys out
[01:21:31.610 --> 01:21:33.610]  there and so again that's
[01:21:33.610 --> 01:21:35.610]  another shout out to him probably doing the due diligence
[01:21:35.610 --> 01:21:37.610]  doing the work keeping the records
[01:21:37.610 --> 01:21:39.610]  again he's one of the
[01:21:39.610 --> 01:21:41.610]  few dudes out there I see
[01:21:41.610 --> 01:21:43.610]  that truly must have
[01:21:43.610 --> 01:21:45.610]  the work that he's claiming
[01:21:45.610 --> 01:21:47.610]  because he comes out with genetics that
[01:21:47.610 --> 01:21:49.610]  time and time again people want to grow
[01:21:49.610 --> 01:21:51.610]  with true respect
[01:21:51.610 --> 01:21:53.610]  and that takes a long
[01:21:53.610 --> 01:21:55.610]  time to achieve you mentioned
[01:21:55.750 --> 01:21:57.750]  genome alchemy he's about to
[01:21:57.750 --> 01:21:59.750]  have a son here so we should give him a
[01:21:59.750 --> 01:22:01.750]  shout out genome alchemy
[01:22:01.750 --> 01:22:03.750]  Greg is a local
[01:22:03.750 --> 01:22:05.750]  known individual
[01:22:05.750 --> 01:22:07.750]  here in Colorado
[01:22:07.750 --> 01:22:09.750]  and again he's an entrepreneur so if you guys
[01:22:09.750 --> 01:22:11.750]  want to invest in seeds for 2023
[01:22:11.750 --> 01:22:13.750]  maybe check him out
[01:22:13.750 --> 01:22:15.750]  I know he's on Daga
[01:22:15.750 --> 01:22:17.750]  and he's got I think a couple of
[01:22:17.750 --> 01:22:19.750]  other things out there but for those
[01:22:19.750 --> 01:22:21.750]  that don't know a lot of people
[01:22:21.750 --> 01:22:23.750]  grow his stuff almost like a white label
[01:22:23.890 --> 01:22:25.890]  his stuff is so tried and true
[01:22:25.890 --> 01:22:27.890]  if you know then
[01:22:27.890 --> 01:22:29.890]  you know kind of thing and I think
[01:22:29.890 --> 01:22:31.890]  now he's willing to put his name
[01:22:31.890 --> 01:22:33.890]  out there a little bit more I think when you know you're having a child
[01:22:33.890 --> 01:22:35.890]  you kind of like
[01:22:35.890 --> 01:22:37.890]  put yourself out there a little bit because it's time to
[01:22:37.890 --> 01:22:39.890]  so if you're wanting
[01:22:39.890 --> 01:22:41.890]  to support kind of like a small time individual
[01:22:41.890 --> 01:22:43.890]  that puts in the work
[01:22:43.890 --> 01:22:45.890]  then yeah go back maybe even watch
[01:22:45.890 --> 01:22:47.890]  an episode or two he's been on the show a couple times
[01:22:47.890 --> 01:22:49.890]  but that's where you're going to find real
[01:22:49.890 --> 01:22:51.890]  success is finding the individual where
[01:22:52.030 --> 01:22:54.030]  you could talk to you'd be able to
[01:22:54.030 --> 01:22:56.030]  meet him at an expo or somebody else
[01:22:56.030 --> 01:22:58.030]  that you like but the small
[01:22:58.030 --> 01:23:00.030]  time individuals are the ones in my opinion
[01:23:00.030 --> 01:23:02.030]  especially when you're first getting into this
[01:23:02.030 --> 01:23:04.030]  that you can find true success with
[01:23:04.030 --> 01:23:06.030]  if it's a larger
[01:23:06.030 --> 01:23:08.030]  bigger individual there's a lot more
[01:23:08.030 --> 01:23:10.030]  seeds out there so
[01:23:10.030 --> 01:23:12.030]  in my opinion you know that's kind of like a
[01:23:12.030 --> 01:23:14.030]  lottery ticket to really find
[01:23:14.030 --> 01:23:16.030]  the stuff that's on the package you know you don't
[01:23:16.030 --> 01:23:18.030]  necessarily obviously get that
[01:23:18.030 --> 01:23:20.030]  but when you're talking to a local homie
[01:23:20.170 --> 01:23:22.170]  that has seeds that he's trying to get his name out
[01:23:22.170 --> 01:23:24.170]  there like Greg
[01:23:24.170 --> 01:23:26.170]  he's going personally
[01:23:26.170 --> 01:23:28.170]  putting those seeds in the pack he's hitting
[01:23:28.170 --> 01:23:30.170]  you up with the tiger eyes
[01:23:30.170 --> 01:23:32.170]  and I think you're going to
[01:23:32.170 --> 01:23:34.170]  again you're going to find easier
[01:23:34.170 --> 01:23:36.170]  success if you take the time to maybe
[01:23:36.170 --> 01:23:38.170]  go out of your way
[01:23:38.170 --> 01:23:40.170]  and find the individuals
[01:23:40.170 --> 01:23:42.170]  that are small time
[01:23:42.170 --> 01:23:44.170]  but have big time genetics
[01:23:44.170 --> 01:23:48.400]  yeah good point
[01:23:48.400 --> 01:23:50.400]  yeah small time I like
[01:23:50.540 --> 01:23:52.540]  support small guys
[01:23:52.540 --> 01:23:54.540]  small guys are putting in that work
[01:23:54.540 --> 01:23:56.540]  that's the key
[01:23:56.540 --> 01:23:58.540]  I don't care how big or small you are
[01:23:58.540 --> 01:24:00.540]  if you're putting in that work
[01:24:00.540 --> 01:24:02.540]  I'd rather go small guy that's putting in work than big guy
[01:24:02.540 --> 01:24:04.540]  that just got lazy and fat catting it over there
[01:24:04.540 --> 01:24:06.540]  you know what I mean
[01:24:06.540 --> 01:24:08.540]  might not be putting out his fire work
[01:24:08.540 --> 01:24:10.540]  like he used to maybe not as hungry
[01:24:10.540 --> 01:24:12.540]  find somebody that matches where you're at
[01:24:12.540 --> 01:24:14.540]  matches your hunger
[01:24:14.540 --> 01:24:16.540]  you know what I mean
[01:24:16.540 --> 01:24:18.540]  I think that's key
[01:24:18.680 --> 01:24:20.680]  I think learning
[01:24:20.680 --> 01:24:22.680]  don't be a snob
[01:24:22.680 --> 01:24:24.680]  with it either
[01:24:24.680 --> 01:24:26.680]  even belief says I'll grow anybody's seeds
[01:24:26.680 --> 01:24:28.680]  when he said that that told me
[01:24:28.680 --> 01:24:30.680]  he'll grow anybody's seeds and I should
[01:24:30.680 --> 01:24:32.680]  grow anybody's seeds too
[01:24:32.680 --> 01:24:34.680]  that tells you good genetics are where you find them
[01:24:38.530 --> 01:24:40.530]  that was actually one of the things I wanted to talk to Sheldon about
[01:24:40.530 --> 01:24:42.530]  Texas is known
[01:24:42.530 --> 01:24:44.530]  for just ridiculous humidity
[01:24:44.530 --> 01:24:46.530]  when I was a little kid
[01:24:46.530 --> 01:24:48.530]  we even had soccer tournaments all the time
[01:24:48.670 --> 01:24:50.670]  in Texas
[01:24:50.670 --> 01:24:52.670]  it's a big state
[01:24:52.670 --> 01:24:54.670]  we'd have all kinds of injuries
[01:24:54.670 --> 01:24:56.670]  that we wouldn't notice in other states
[01:24:56.670 --> 01:24:58.670]  just because of the climate there
[01:24:58.670 --> 01:25:00.670]  extremely hot
[01:25:00.670 --> 01:25:02.670]  extremely high in humidity
[01:25:02.670 --> 01:25:04.670]  obviously
[01:25:04.670 --> 01:25:06.670]  you can bat certain things
[01:25:06.670 --> 01:25:08.670]  but what are some of the genetics that you found
[01:25:08.670 --> 01:25:10.670]  or some of the small time individuals
[01:25:10.670 --> 01:25:12.670]  big name individuals that you found
[01:25:12.670 --> 01:25:14.670]  that can grow in that kind of environment
[01:25:14.670 --> 01:25:16.670]  I don't know anybody
[01:25:16.810 --> 01:25:18.810]  here that can
[01:25:18.810 --> 01:25:20.810]  to be honest I don't know any
[01:25:20.810 --> 01:25:22.810]  growers here really period
[01:25:22.810 --> 01:25:24.810]  aside from a couple hemp growers
[01:25:24.810 --> 01:25:26.810]  I've never met them
[01:25:26.810 --> 01:25:28.810]  most of the people I'm dealing with
[01:25:28.810 --> 01:25:30.810]  these days are in Oklahoma
[01:25:30.810 --> 01:25:32.810]  for a reason
[01:25:32.810 --> 01:25:34.810]  I mean yeah
[01:25:34.810 --> 01:25:36.810]  I don't know
[01:25:36.810 --> 01:25:38.810]  the genetics down here are all CBD and CBG
[01:25:38.810 --> 01:25:42.210]  as far as I know
[01:25:42.210 --> 01:25:44.210]  probably similar to Oklahoma too
[01:25:44.210 --> 01:25:46.210]  how far are you from Oklahoma
[01:25:46.350 --> 01:25:48.350]  what's the closest city in Oklahoma
[01:25:48.350 --> 01:25:50.350]  to you
[01:25:50.350 --> 01:25:52.350]  it's about an hour and a half
[01:25:52.350 --> 01:25:54.350]  from my driveway to the Oklahoma
[01:25:54.350 --> 01:25:56.350]  border
[01:25:56.350 --> 01:25:58.350]  are you panhandled
[01:25:58.350 --> 01:26:00.350]  are you in a Texas panhandle
[01:26:00.350 --> 01:26:02.350]  part of Texas
[01:26:02.350 --> 01:26:04.350]  I am literally right in between Dallas and Fort Worth
[01:26:04.350 --> 01:26:06.350]  oh ok
[01:26:06.350 --> 01:26:08.350]  gotcha
[01:26:08.350 --> 01:26:10.350]  yeah man ain't nobody growing down there
[01:26:10.350 --> 01:26:12.350]  Brian and they ain't talking about
[01:26:12.350 --> 01:26:14.350]  they're growing but they ain't talking about it
[01:26:14.490 --> 01:26:16.490]  after I asked that question
[01:26:16.490 --> 01:26:18.490]  I kind of felt stupid to be honest
[01:26:18.490 --> 01:26:20.490]  there might be one day
[01:26:20.490 --> 01:26:22.490]  when Texas opens up
[01:26:22.490 --> 01:26:24.490]  they might just be like hey surprise
[01:26:24.490 --> 01:26:26.490]  here's what we've been quiet about for the last 40 years
[01:26:26.490 --> 01:26:28.490]  exactly
[01:26:28.490 --> 01:26:30.490]  for sure
[01:26:30.490 --> 01:26:32.490]  where the laws are the strictest
[01:26:32.490 --> 01:26:34.490]  is usually where the talent is
[01:26:34.490 --> 01:26:36.490]  it's just never obviously they never poke their head out
[01:26:36.490 --> 01:26:38.490]  usually that's also
[01:26:38.490 --> 01:26:40.490]  where the money is where the risk is
[01:26:40.490 --> 01:26:42.490]  yeah but
[01:26:42.630 --> 01:26:44.630]  shame on me for even kind of bringing that up
[01:26:44.630 --> 01:26:46.630]  no I think it makes sense
[01:26:46.630 --> 01:26:48.630]  that's a great question
[01:26:48.630 --> 01:26:50.630]  but not for technical
[01:26:52.630 --> 01:26:54.630]  so what do you think
[01:26:54.630 --> 01:26:56.630]  moving forward
[01:26:56.630 --> 01:26:58.630]  when you're building soil systems
[01:26:58.630 --> 01:27:00.630]  that kind of stuff
[01:27:00.630 --> 01:27:02.630]  using IMO's and kind of
[01:27:02.630 --> 01:27:04.630]  taking it to the next level
[01:27:04.630 --> 01:27:06.630]  what do you guys think are the future
[01:27:06.630 --> 01:27:08.630]  of that is it playing around with
[01:27:08.630 --> 01:27:10.630]  acorns and different things
[01:27:10.770 --> 01:27:12.770]  is that the future of it
[01:27:12.770 --> 01:27:14.770]  or do you think there's going to be some new way
[01:27:14.770 --> 01:27:16.770]  to do things that we haven't even really thought about yet
[01:27:18.770 --> 01:27:20.770]  I think we're always going to progress
[01:27:20.770 --> 01:27:22.770]  we've adapted
[01:27:22.770 --> 01:27:24.770]  and we've changed some things
[01:27:24.770 --> 01:27:26.770]  along the way as we've learned more
[01:27:26.770 --> 01:27:28.770]  right
[01:27:28.770 --> 01:27:30.770]  the current
[01:27:30.770 --> 01:27:32.770]  liquid IMO recipe for instance
[01:27:32.770 --> 01:27:34.770]  if we're sticking to
[01:27:34.770 --> 01:27:36.770]  Korean natural farming
[01:27:36.770 --> 01:27:38.770]  the old recipe for that
[01:27:38.910 --> 01:27:40.910]  it had no aeration involved
[01:27:40.910 --> 01:27:42.910]  it used a very specific type of IMO collection
[01:27:42.910 --> 01:27:44.910]  it was like from rice stumps
[01:27:44.910 --> 01:27:46.910]  or bamboo
[01:27:46.910 --> 01:27:48.910]  it was for foliar application
[01:27:48.910 --> 01:27:50.910]  to prevent damping off
[01:27:50.910 --> 01:27:52.910]  and stuff in seedlings and such
[01:27:52.910 --> 01:27:54.910]  so the liquid IMO recipe now is the one that
[01:27:54.910 --> 01:27:56.910]  Chris Trump developed
[01:27:56.910 --> 01:27:58.910]  and it's actually been approved by Master Cho
[01:27:58.910 --> 01:28:00.910]  as being you know what that works
[01:28:00.910 --> 01:28:02.910]  so that's how they teach it now
[01:28:02.910 --> 01:28:04.910]  things like that happen
[01:28:04.910 --> 01:28:06.910]  it does come down to
[01:28:07.050 --> 01:28:09.050]  experimentation and observation
[01:28:09.050 --> 01:28:11.050]  and community coming together
[01:28:11.050 --> 01:28:13.050]  and learning from each other
[01:28:13.050 --> 01:28:15.050]  you know things can change
[01:28:15.050 --> 01:28:17.050]  for sure
[01:28:17.050 --> 01:28:19.050]  it comes back to that experience aspect
[01:28:19.050 --> 01:28:21.050]  and knowing how to
[01:28:21.050 --> 01:28:23.050]  determine if something is better or not
[01:28:23.050 --> 01:28:25.050]  is crucial
[01:28:27.050 --> 01:28:29.050]  I think the aquatic
[01:28:29.050 --> 01:28:31.050]  side is where it's going to start
[01:28:31.050 --> 01:28:33.050]  that's kind of where I'm looking
[01:28:33.050 --> 01:28:35.050]  for some new action
[01:28:35.190 --> 01:28:37.190]  you know if you will
[01:28:37.190 --> 01:28:39.190]  I want to get like a
[01:28:39.190 --> 01:28:41.190]  you know how we do our horizontal soil
[01:28:41.190 --> 01:28:43.190]  so we do that sand
[01:28:43.190 --> 01:28:45.190]  gravel layer on the bottom
[01:28:45.190 --> 01:28:47.190]  then just bulk of the soil
[01:28:47.190 --> 01:28:49.190]  and then kind of an organic layer on top
[01:28:49.190 --> 01:28:51.190]  I want to do kind of like
[01:28:51.190 --> 01:28:53.190]  a recirculating system where
[01:28:53.190 --> 01:28:55.190]  a kind of water
[01:28:55.190 --> 01:28:57.190]  pond water runs underneath
[01:28:57.190 --> 01:28:59.190]  my gravel layer
[01:28:59.190 --> 01:29:01.190]  so it's kind of like you still got the soil
[01:29:01.190 --> 01:29:03.190]  but it's like an underground aquifer of water
[01:29:03.330 --> 01:29:05.330]  it's always there just freshly running
[01:29:05.330 --> 01:29:07.330]  so that's something
[01:29:07.330 --> 01:29:09.330]  I'm kind of working on but I think the aquatic
[01:29:09.330 --> 01:29:11.330]  stuff is kind of where
[01:29:11.330 --> 01:29:13.330]  you know people are kind of going
[01:29:13.330 --> 01:29:15.330]  I've seen a lot of
[01:29:15.330 --> 01:29:17.330]  under microscope similar microbes
[01:29:17.330 --> 01:29:19.330]  same thing in the soil that I see
[01:29:19.330 --> 01:29:21.330]  even in my aquarium like it's so wild
[01:29:21.330 --> 01:29:23.330]  like the way that
[01:29:23.330 --> 01:29:25.330]  I think that
[01:29:25.330 --> 01:29:27.330]  I think that divide between
[01:29:27.330 --> 01:29:29.330]  water and land is less than we think
[01:29:29.330 --> 01:29:31.330]  on the microbial scale
[01:29:33.330 --> 01:29:35.330]  I agree and I think
[01:29:35.330 --> 01:29:37.330]  I've listened to you guys talk to
[01:29:37.330 --> 01:29:39.330]  Layton Morrison a lot and I think he's mentioned it even about
[01:29:39.330 --> 01:29:41.330]  how we've
[01:29:41.330 --> 01:29:43.330]  there is less animal
[01:29:43.330 --> 01:29:45.330]  coming from water to land back and forth
[01:29:45.330 --> 01:29:47.330]  action happening now than there was
[01:29:47.330 --> 01:29:49.330]  many years ago before humans came in
[01:29:49.330 --> 01:29:51.330]  and just kind of took over everything
[01:29:51.330 --> 01:29:53.330]  so a lot of that transfer was happening
[01:29:53.330 --> 01:29:55.330]  from aquatic to land
[01:29:55.330 --> 01:29:57.330]  and back and forth so
[01:29:57.330 --> 01:29:59.330]  it was they were kind of interconnected
[01:29:59.330 --> 01:30:01.330]  and worked together if you will they were being
[01:30:01.470 --> 01:30:03.470]  introduced to the land and again
[01:30:03.470 --> 01:30:05.470]  if you we all came from the ocean
[01:30:05.470 --> 01:30:07.470]  if you get real heady into like
[01:30:07.470 --> 01:30:09.470]  Korean natural farming and use of sea water
[01:30:09.470 --> 01:30:11.470]  but it's something to
[01:30:11.470 --> 01:30:13.470]  factor it's just those microbes
[01:30:13.470 --> 01:30:15.470]  aren't much anymore as they used to
[01:30:15.470 --> 01:30:17.470]  be so bringing them you know
[01:30:17.470 --> 01:30:19.470]  into our systems it's not
[01:30:19.470 --> 01:30:21.470]  a crazy thing to consider
[01:30:21.470 --> 01:30:23.470]  I like that
[01:30:23.470 --> 01:30:25.470]  Sheldon it's kind of like they could be
[01:30:25.470 --> 01:30:27.470]  just waiting like sleeping waiting to
[01:30:27.470 --> 01:30:29.470]  come out because think about it all like beavers
[01:30:29.610 --> 01:30:31.610]  muskrats where it's a lot more
[01:30:31.610 --> 01:30:33.610]  mammals that were in the water
[01:30:33.610 --> 01:30:35.610]  dragging mud up onto
[01:30:35.610 --> 01:30:37.610]  the land vice versa mud down
[01:30:37.610 --> 01:30:39.610]  excuse me you know back into the water
[01:30:39.610 --> 01:30:41.610]  building dams so
[01:30:41.610 --> 01:30:43.610]  yeah man that might be something that
[01:30:43.610 --> 01:30:45.610]  you know could be like ready to
[01:30:45.610 --> 01:30:47.610]  explode like once that connection's
[01:30:47.610 --> 01:30:49.610]  made in the right way
[01:30:49.610 --> 01:30:51.610]  could be excellent for health
[01:30:51.610 --> 01:30:53.610]  for plant health
[01:30:53.610 --> 01:30:55.610]  and maximizing the plants expression
[01:30:55.610 --> 01:30:57.610]  so just rabbit holes I'd
[01:30:57.750 --> 01:30:59.750]  like to experiment with in my life
[01:30:59.750 --> 01:31:01.750]  you know what I mean while I'm doing shit
[01:31:01.750 --> 01:31:03.750]  while I have a pond while I have an
[01:31:03.750 --> 01:31:05.750]  aquarium why not tie
[01:31:05.750 --> 01:31:07.750]  these things together
[01:31:07.750 --> 01:31:09.750]  doesn't have to all be done today
[01:31:09.750 --> 01:31:11.750]  but it's something I'm working on
[01:31:11.750 --> 01:31:13.750]  like they say it's a life's work
[01:31:13.750 --> 01:31:15.750]  you're working in that direction
[01:31:15.750 --> 01:31:17.750]  and I think that's where great things can be
[01:31:17.750 --> 01:31:19.750]  discovered is when people spend
[01:31:19.750 --> 01:31:21.750]  long periods of time kind of
[01:31:21.750 --> 01:31:23.750]  working on processes and
[01:31:23.750 --> 01:31:25.750]  working and figuring it out
[01:31:25.890 --> 01:31:27.890]  just like the liquid IMO that's a wonderful
[01:31:27.890 --> 01:31:29.890]  input man and Chris did
[01:31:29.890 --> 01:31:31.890]  his thing when he came up with that because
[01:31:31.890 --> 01:31:33.890]  it fucking works like I
[01:31:33.890 --> 01:31:35.890]  do it exactly like he shows it
[01:31:35.890 --> 01:31:37.890]  and the shit works
[01:31:37.890 --> 01:31:39.890]  you know so
[01:31:41.890 --> 01:31:43.890]  yeah I actually kind of really
[01:31:43.890 --> 01:31:45.890]  admire him for that aspect of like
[01:31:45.890 --> 01:31:47.890]  kind of just taking it he obviously had made
[01:31:47.890 --> 01:31:49.890]  it a bunch of times
[01:31:49.890 --> 01:31:51.890]  moving forward it seems like people are
[01:31:51.890 --> 01:31:53.890]  playing around with the different T's and stuff
[01:31:54.030 --> 01:31:56.030]  some people have moved past that
[01:31:56.030 --> 01:31:58.030]  they just want to do
[01:31:58.030 --> 01:32:00.030]  a simpler version of that
[01:32:00.030 --> 01:32:02.030]  some people are really getting into the complex T's
[01:32:02.030 --> 01:32:04.030]  what are your
[01:32:04.030 --> 01:32:06.030]  thoughts on that Sheldon
[01:32:06.030 --> 01:32:08.030]  are you playing around
[01:32:08.030 --> 01:32:10.030]  with a variety of different things are you keeping it
[01:32:10.030 --> 01:32:12.030]  super basic almost kind of like
[01:32:12.030 --> 01:32:14.030]  in a perpetual way where you got it dialed in
[01:32:14.030 --> 01:32:16.030]  why mess up
[01:32:16.030 --> 01:32:18.030]  and try to reinvent it
[01:32:18.030 --> 01:32:20.030]  both so
[01:32:20.030 --> 01:32:22.030]  Mike the stuff that I'm growing that I need
[01:32:22.170 --> 01:32:24.170]  you know like I need results
[01:32:24.170 --> 01:32:26.170]  like guaranteed I'm doing it by
[01:32:26.170 --> 01:32:28.170]  you know what I know works
[01:32:28.170 --> 01:32:30.170]  it's fail proof
[01:32:30.170 --> 01:32:32.170]  like every time but at the same time
[01:32:32.170 --> 01:32:34.170]  I am constantly
[01:32:34.170 --> 01:32:36.170]  experimenting
[01:32:36.170 --> 01:32:38.170]  just trying different things looking at
[01:32:38.170 --> 01:32:40.170]  different things watching plant responses doing
[01:32:40.170 --> 01:32:42.170]  side by sides and also
[01:32:42.170 --> 01:32:44.170]  trying to fall asleep at night and theorizing
[01:32:44.170 --> 01:32:46.170]  just all this crazy stuff
[01:32:46.170 --> 01:32:48.170]  first thing in the morning I got to do this because I have to
[01:32:48.170 --> 01:32:50.170]  know the answer
[01:32:50.310 --> 01:32:52.310]  I'm like that all the time
[01:32:52.310 --> 01:32:54.310]  so I'm constantly scratching
[01:32:54.310 --> 01:32:56.310]  an itch if you will and I have learned
[01:32:56.310 --> 01:32:58.310]  a lot just from that alone
[01:32:58.310 --> 01:33:00.310]  I've started learning some
[01:33:00.310 --> 01:33:02.310]  things you know not much
[01:33:02.310 --> 01:33:04.310]  but I've definitely learned enough
[01:33:04.310 --> 01:33:06.310]  through some of these experiments and such
[01:33:06.310 --> 01:33:08.310]  that it's opened my eyes to like
[01:33:08.310 --> 01:33:10.310]  other realms of things that I may not have
[01:33:10.310 --> 01:33:12.310]  considered before and
[01:33:12.310 --> 01:33:14.310]  starting to incorporate those in kind of like
[01:33:14.310 --> 01:33:16.310]  Marco was just talking about the whole aquatic side
[01:33:16.310 --> 01:33:18.310]  we over here talking about soil soil soil
[01:33:18.450 --> 01:33:20.450]  but there's only a handful of people
[01:33:20.450 --> 01:33:22.450]  that are really heavy into the aquatic side
[01:33:22.450 --> 01:33:24.450]  of things and bringing that in
[01:33:24.450 --> 01:33:26.450]  and utilizing both
[01:33:26.450 --> 01:33:28.450]  you know so
[01:33:28.450 --> 01:33:30.450]  yeah
[01:33:30.450 --> 01:33:32.450]  I'm trying
[01:33:32.450 --> 01:33:34.450]  I hope I reached out to Ryan
[01:33:34.450 --> 01:33:36.450]  to make it where he's a busy guy
[01:33:36.450 --> 01:33:38.450]  and all this stuff but he works at
[01:33:38.450 --> 01:33:40.450]  this local like exotic
[01:33:40.450 --> 01:33:42.450]  aquatic place and they have
[01:33:42.450 --> 01:33:44.450]  you know forgive me
[01:33:44.450 --> 01:33:46.450]  Ryan I don't really know what
[01:33:46.590 --> 01:33:48.590]  is there but you can tell that it's
[01:33:48.590 --> 01:33:50.590]  very exotic like it's strikingly
[01:33:50.590 --> 01:33:52.590]  beautiful in the color
[01:33:52.590 --> 01:33:54.590]  there's just a lot of things to it
[01:33:54.590 --> 01:33:56.590]  I think that might also be in the future
[01:33:56.590 --> 01:33:58.590]  where somebody just can understand that
[01:33:58.590 --> 01:34:00.590]  microbial world when I was
[01:34:00.590 --> 01:34:02.590]  at the shop man there were people there
[01:34:02.590 --> 01:34:04.590]  spending I mean it's not
[01:34:04.590 --> 01:34:06.590]  that big of a store so you could hear what they were spending
[01:34:06.590 --> 01:34:08.590]  and obviously this is a hobby
[01:34:08.590 --> 01:34:10.590]  you know having your high end
[01:34:10.590 --> 01:34:12.590]  salt water tanks and stuff in your house
[01:34:12.590 --> 01:34:14.590]  seems to be maybe a hobby
[01:34:14.730 --> 01:34:16.730]  that's growing I don't know enough
[01:34:16.730 --> 01:34:18.730]  about it so hopefully we can interview Ryan on that
[01:34:18.730 --> 01:34:20.730]  but he was explaining to me
[01:34:20.730 --> 01:34:22.730]  that it is kind of
[01:34:22.730 --> 01:34:24.730]  it's closer to apples
[01:34:24.730 --> 01:34:26.730]  than we probably think
[01:34:26.730 --> 01:34:28.730]  and so when you can start to kind of build stuff up
[01:34:28.730 --> 01:34:30.730]  it does seem like diversity matters
[01:34:30.730 --> 01:34:32.730]  in his world
[01:34:32.730 --> 01:34:34.730]  at his job as well as when he comes home
[01:34:34.730 --> 01:34:36.730]  and he's grown cannabis in the soil
[01:34:36.730 --> 01:34:38.730]  so he, again buddy I don't know if you're
[01:34:38.730 --> 01:34:40.730]  watching the show today but
[01:34:40.730 --> 01:34:42.730]  you're another
[01:34:42.870 --> 01:34:44.870]  you're so humble with that shit man
[01:34:44.870 --> 01:34:46.870]  but we'd be able to pick your brain on
[01:34:46.870 --> 01:34:48.870]  both sides so you understand the aquatic sides
[01:34:48.870 --> 01:34:50.870]  you obviously understand the soil side
[01:34:50.870 --> 01:34:52.870]  and I think that's a rare thing
[01:34:52.870 --> 01:34:54.870]  that maybe you don't even see in yourself
[01:34:54.870 --> 01:34:56.870]  that again could potentially
[01:34:56.870 --> 01:34:58.870]  be the future of when you're able to understand
[01:34:58.870 --> 01:35:00.870]  both sides of that you know what kind of
[01:35:00.870 --> 01:35:02.870]  wizardry could be produced
[01:35:02.870 --> 01:35:04.870]  Yeah man
[01:35:04.870 --> 01:35:06.870]  Ryan and I we were actually chopping
[01:35:06.870 --> 01:35:08.870]  it up on some
[01:35:08.870 --> 01:35:10.870]  as he does you know re-aquarium
[01:35:11.010 --> 01:35:13.010]  you know
[01:35:13.010 --> 01:35:15.010]  reef tanks which are you know salt water
[01:35:15.010 --> 01:35:17.010]  aquariums and he does maintenance on them
[01:35:17.010 --> 01:35:19.010]  and all that kind of stuff, bills them, all kinds of shit
[01:35:19.010 --> 01:35:21.010]  but he's
[01:35:21.010 --> 01:35:23.010]  we were talking about the water
[01:35:23.010 --> 01:35:25.010]  you know what I mean and he's managing
[01:35:25.010 --> 01:35:27.010]  a couple of his tanks chemical free
[01:35:27.010 --> 01:35:29.010]  obviously and so we
[01:35:29.010 --> 01:35:31.010]  started talking you know hey sea water
[01:35:31.010 --> 01:35:33.010]  you know and he's like well shit man
[01:35:33.010 --> 01:35:35.010]  I can send you some of the you know when I clean
[01:35:35.010 --> 01:35:37.010]  the aquarium I'll send you some you know what I mean
[01:35:37.010 --> 01:35:39.010]  so he sent me some
[01:35:39.150 --> 01:35:41.150]  and so that's something that I
[01:35:41.150 --> 01:35:43.150]  look under the scope loaded with
[01:35:43.150 --> 01:35:45.150]  wild looking microbiology
[01:35:45.150 --> 01:35:47.150]  you know what I mean but then not
[01:35:47.150 --> 01:35:49.150]  only that the benefit of the sea water
[01:35:49.150 --> 01:35:51.150]  you know what I mean so
[01:35:51.150 --> 01:35:53.150]  that could be a whole other input right there
[01:35:53.150 --> 01:35:55.150]  you know what I mean and that's
[01:35:55.150 --> 01:35:57.150]  where I feel like is you know kind of
[01:35:57.150 --> 01:35:59.150]  using what's available to you kind of gives you
[01:35:59.150 --> 01:36:01.150]  room
[01:36:01.150 --> 01:36:03.150]  for new growth you know from aquariums
[01:36:03.150 --> 01:36:05.150]  to salt water aquariums
[01:36:05.150 --> 01:36:07.150]  because now that we know
[01:36:07.290 --> 01:36:09.290]  using sea water as we do
[01:36:09.290 --> 01:36:11.290]  now aquarium sea water is no longer
[01:36:11.290 --> 01:36:13.290]  is not a waste you know that could be a
[01:36:13.290 --> 01:36:15.290]  beneficial input in our
[01:36:15.290 --> 01:36:17.290]  garden so yeah
[01:36:17.290 --> 01:36:19.290]  I'd love to have Brian on here to chop it up
[01:36:19.290 --> 01:36:21.290]  and stuff man and
[01:36:21.290 --> 01:36:23.290]  talk about it a little bit but yeah
[01:36:23.290 --> 01:36:25.290]  sea water excellent
[01:36:25.290 --> 01:36:27.290]  man even if every time I go
[01:36:27.290 --> 01:36:29.290]  to the beach or the ocean I grab
[01:36:29.290 --> 01:36:31.290]  some you know what I mean go to a good spot
[01:36:31.290 --> 01:36:33.290]  it feels like it's clean you know not
[01:36:33.290 --> 01:36:35.290]  don't go to the boat dock
[01:36:35.430 --> 01:36:37.430]  you know running the boats in and out
[01:36:37.430 --> 01:36:39.430]  find somewhere off to the side and try to get you
[01:36:39.430 --> 01:36:41.430]  some good clean salt water
[01:36:41.430 --> 01:36:43.430]  if you can your plants will love it
[01:36:43.430 --> 01:36:45.430]  it sounds
[01:36:45.430 --> 01:36:47.430]  like too if you're able to dial
[01:36:47.430 --> 01:36:49.430]  in your microbial life
[01:36:49.430 --> 01:36:51.430]  in your salt water tanks that it might be a little
[01:36:51.430 --> 01:36:53.430]  bit easier than I guess what some people
[01:36:53.430 --> 01:36:55.430]  are accustomed to about the amount of labor
[01:36:55.430 --> 01:36:57.430]  and all that so again the microbial
[01:36:57.430 --> 01:36:59.430]  world understanding this might be another
[01:36:59.430 --> 01:37:01.430]  labor of love where you can
[01:37:01.430 --> 01:37:03.430]  build up these aquatic tanks
[01:37:03.570 --> 01:37:05.570]  have your basement full of
[01:37:05.570 --> 01:37:07.570]  beautiful plants and you're kind of
[01:37:07.570 --> 01:37:09.570]  using those same processes as you're
[01:37:09.570 --> 01:37:11.570]  going out throughout life
[01:37:11.570 --> 01:37:13.570]  and I don't know about you guys but there's nothing
[01:37:13.570 --> 01:37:15.570]  better to me than growing plants
[01:37:15.570 --> 01:37:17.570]  and then kind of coming upstairs maybe smoking a little
[01:37:17.570 --> 01:37:19.570]  bit and staring at a fish tank
[01:37:19.570 --> 01:37:21.570]  or you know I kind of get lost in those
[01:37:21.570 --> 01:37:23.570]  kind of things so
[01:37:23.570 --> 01:37:25.570]  I find that to be
[01:37:25.570 --> 01:37:27.570]  truly interesting because that could be another
[01:37:27.570 --> 01:37:29.570]  opportunity I think for the masses if
[01:37:29.570 --> 01:37:31.570]  that continued to
[01:37:31.710 --> 01:37:33.710]  be something where
[01:37:33.710 --> 01:37:35.710]  a lot of individuals seem to spend
[01:37:35.710 --> 01:37:37.710]  quite a bit of money when
[01:37:37.710 --> 01:37:39.710]  they're building out their salt water fish tanks
[01:37:39.710 --> 01:37:41.710]  and that was all new to me
[01:37:41.710 --> 01:37:43.710]  yeah
[01:37:43.710 --> 01:37:45.710]  that stuff ain't cheap man salt water
[01:37:45.710 --> 01:37:47.710]  the fish and the
[01:37:47.710 --> 01:37:49.710]  coral is what costs you
[01:37:49.710 --> 01:37:51.710]  like a tank can have $10,000
[01:37:51.710 --> 01:37:53.710]  worth of coral in it like easy
[01:37:53.710 --> 01:37:55.710]  like a small aquarium
[01:37:55.710 --> 01:37:57.710]  like some of that stuff but the
[01:37:57.710 --> 01:37:59.710]  cool thing about it is it grows
[01:37:59.850 --> 01:38:01.850]  like you buy them small they grow
[01:38:01.850 --> 01:38:03.850]  and the value of them grows as they grow
[01:38:03.850 --> 01:38:05.850]  like you said another
[01:38:05.850 --> 01:38:07.850]  lane man if you could set up
[01:38:07.850 --> 01:38:09.850]  reef aquariums and get things to grow
[01:38:09.850 --> 01:38:11.850]  you can start small
[01:38:11.850 --> 01:38:13.850]  buy them cheap sell them for more
[01:38:13.850 --> 01:38:15.850]  just another lane an option
[01:38:15.850 --> 01:38:17.850]  for being an entrepreneur
[01:38:17.850 --> 01:38:19.850]  in this world we're in
[01:38:21.850 --> 01:38:23.850]  yeah I think I mean Sheldon, Marco
[01:38:23.850 --> 01:38:25.850]  and myself we all find
[01:38:25.850 --> 01:38:27.850]  ways to monetize
[01:38:27.990 --> 01:38:29.990]  our businesses
[01:38:29.990 --> 01:38:31.990]  and I think there's something to that that once you've
[01:38:31.990 --> 01:38:33.990]  achieved that you want to kind of give it
[01:38:33.990 --> 01:38:35.990]  to somebody else because it gives you
[01:38:35.990 --> 01:38:37.990]  especially when it comes to
[01:38:37.990 --> 01:38:39.990]  time like that is the thing that no matter
[01:38:39.990 --> 01:38:41.990]  what kind of money you have you still have that
[01:38:41.990 --> 01:38:43.990]  same amount of time so that's
[01:38:43.990 --> 01:38:45.990]  what the wealthy that's why they buy
[01:38:45.990 --> 01:38:47.990]  the super jets and all that because they want to be able to
[01:38:47.990 --> 01:38:49.990]  get places well if you're just
[01:38:49.990 --> 01:38:51.990]  a family man or a small
[01:38:51.990 --> 01:38:53.990]  time individual getting that time back
[01:38:53.990 --> 01:38:55.990]  for me and I hope other individuals
[01:38:56.130 --> 01:38:58.130]  now you get to research even more
[01:38:58.130 --> 01:39:00.130]  now you get to explore more things
[01:39:00.130 --> 01:39:02.130]  and find out more stuff
[01:39:02.130 --> 01:39:04.130]  maybe be able to attend a few more events
[01:39:04.130 --> 01:39:06.130]  and I think kind of getting that back in your life
[01:39:06.130 --> 01:39:08.130]  understanding natural farming
[01:39:08.130 --> 01:39:10.130]  maybe also starting to understand
[01:39:10.130 --> 01:39:12.130]  aquatic microbes
[01:39:12.130 --> 01:39:14.130]  if you're trying to make
[01:39:14.130 --> 01:39:16.130]  a name for yourself and
[01:39:16.130 --> 01:39:18.130]  Ryan I know that you're one of those dudes that can
[01:39:18.130 --> 01:39:20.130]  be at the forefront of that buddy so
[01:39:20.130 --> 01:39:22.130]  if you're watching this or you watch this in the future
[01:39:22.130 --> 01:39:24.130]  man
[01:39:24.270 --> 01:39:26.270]  I know I believe in you dude
[01:39:26.270 --> 01:39:28.270]  I know a lot of people believe in you and I'd love to see you
[01:39:28.270 --> 01:39:30.270]  actually try that man because I know we've talked about
[01:39:30.270 --> 01:39:32.270]  that late night smoking at your kitchen table
[01:39:32.270 --> 01:39:34.270]  and sometimes you just got to get that
[01:39:34.270 --> 01:39:36.270]  extra kick maybe I'd love
[01:39:36.270 --> 01:39:38.270]  to ask Sheldon about that how did you know sir
[01:39:38.270 --> 01:39:40.270]  that you're going to be able to be an entrepreneur
[01:39:40.270 --> 01:39:42.270]  because I know so many people want
[01:39:42.270 --> 01:39:44.270]  to be able to jump off that cliff
[01:39:44.270 --> 01:39:46.270]  and as they get older or they
[01:39:46.270 --> 01:39:48.270]  have children it's
[01:39:48.270 --> 01:39:50.270]  rightfully so it's harder and harder
[01:39:50.270 --> 01:39:52.270]  to take that leap so
[01:39:52.410 --> 01:39:54.410]  what gave you the confidence of like you know what
[01:39:54.410 --> 01:39:56.410]  I'm just going to start rocking my own stuff
[01:39:56.410 --> 01:39:58.410]  that's a really good question
[01:39:58.410 --> 01:40:00.410]  man
[01:40:00.410 --> 01:40:02.410]  I've had so many occupations in
[01:40:02.410 --> 01:40:04.410]  my life I mean so
[01:40:04.410 --> 01:40:06.410]  many I've done so many different things
[01:40:06.410 --> 01:40:08.410]  so many different places and there
[01:40:08.410 --> 01:40:10.410]  was a common theme
[01:40:10.410 --> 01:40:12.410]  amongst all of them and
[01:40:12.410 --> 01:40:14.410]  it ultimately led to
[01:40:14.410 --> 01:40:16.410]  me being unhappy
[01:40:16.410 --> 01:40:18.410]  in every single one of those instances it could have
[01:40:18.410 --> 01:40:20.410]  been you know on paper a dream job
[01:40:20.550 --> 01:40:22.550]  you know pay is great schedule is awesome
[01:40:22.550 --> 01:40:24.550]  I'm doing something that you know on paper
[01:40:24.550 --> 01:40:26.550]  again sounds awesome but
[01:40:26.550 --> 01:40:28.550]  there was something about that
[01:40:28.550 --> 01:40:30.550]  answering to someone else
[01:40:30.550 --> 01:40:32.550]  you know like not not from like
[01:40:32.550 --> 01:40:34.550]  an authority figure kind of thing
[01:40:34.550 --> 01:40:36.550]  I have my own
[01:40:36.550 --> 01:40:38.550]  visions on how I would do this
[01:40:38.550 --> 01:40:40.550]  you know like I can see
[01:40:40.550 --> 01:40:42.550]  this this needs to be changed you know the leadership
[01:40:42.550 --> 01:40:44.550]  isn't great just communicate
[01:40:44.550 --> 01:40:46.550]  listen to me like this
[01:40:46.550 --> 01:40:48.550]  could all you know work you know like
[01:40:48.690 --> 01:40:50.690]  and it got so
[01:40:50.690 --> 01:40:52.690]  frustrating it's like so this I just don't
[01:40:52.690 --> 01:40:54.690]  fit in that kind of scenario I've always been
[01:40:54.690 --> 01:40:56.690]  a little different you know and it never
[01:40:56.690 --> 01:40:58.690]  worked out for me so I was like you know what
[01:40:58.690 --> 01:41:00.690]  I've got so much
[01:41:00.690 --> 01:41:02.690]  knowledge and passion into
[01:41:02.690 --> 01:41:04.690]  these things that I've you know like devoted my
[01:41:04.690 --> 01:41:06.690]  life to that you know I would
[01:41:06.690 --> 01:41:08.690]  love to be able to do something with
[01:41:08.690 --> 01:41:10.690]  I'm fortunately blessed to be in a situation
[01:41:10.690 --> 01:41:12.690]  with my wife that
[01:41:12.690 --> 01:41:14.690]  allows me to be able to do this this was a
[01:41:14.690 --> 01:41:16.690]  jump off for me just you know
[01:41:16.830 --> 01:41:18.830]  a little over a year ago about a year and a half
[01:41:18.830 --> 01:41:20.830]  ago and I started doing this like full
[01:41:20.830 --> 01:41:22.830]  time so
[01:41:22.830 --> 01:41:24.830]  if it weren't for her I wouldn't be able
[01:41:24.830 --> 01:41:26.830]  to be honest with you my
[01:41:26.830 --> 01:41:28.830]  approach to it all is not taking
[01:41:28.830 --> 01:41:30.830]  out some investments not getting loans
[01:41:30.830 --> 01:41:32.830]  and stuff like that if you know if at all
[01:41:32.830 --> 01:41:34.830]  possible I haven't yet
[01:41:34.830 --> 01:41:36.830]  you know kind of grassroots build it from the ground
[01:41:36.830 --> 01:41:38.830]  up as much as possible since I'm in a situation
[01:41:38.830 --> 01:41:40.830]  that I can and I don't have
[01:41:40.830 --> 01:41:42.830]  to you know have
[01:41:42.830 --> 01:41:44.830]  something burning me for the next 10
[01:41:44.970 --> 01:41:46.970]  to 20 years because I just needed to get my foot in the
[01:41:46.970 --> 01:41:48.970]  door you know what I mean
[01:41:48.970 --> 01:41:50.970]  that's where I'm at this is you know things are just
[01:41:50.970 --> 01:41:52.970]  now balls just starting to get rolling
[01:41:52.970 --> 01:41:54.970]  I've made you know very little
[01:41:54.970 --> 01:41:56.970]  money in this last year actually
[01:41:56.970 --> 01:41:58.970]  I'm in the negatives to be
[01:41:58.970 --> 01:42:00.970]  quite honest with you everything
[01:42:00.970 --> 01:42:02.970]  that I've done has really been for free
[01:42:02.970 --> 01:42:04.970]  with the exception of one person
[01:42:04.970 --> 01:42:06.970]  in person class and if
[01:42:06.970 --> 01:42:08.970]  it weren't for the people that hosted that class
[01:42:08.970 --> 01:42:10.970]  out of the goodness of their heart paying
[01:42:10.970 --> 01:42:12.970]  for the catering I would have been upside down
[01:42:13.110 --> 01:42:15.110]  you know I would have been like $800 to $1000
[01:42:15.110 --> 01:42:17.110]  for that event
[01:42:17.110 --> 01:42:19.110]  you know again like I'm not an event planner
[01:42:19.110 --> 01:42:21.110]  this is my first time trying to do something like this
[01:42:21.110 --> 01:42:23.110]  and you know it just it is
[01:42:23.110 --> 01:42:25.110]  what it is so
[01:42:25.110 --> 01:42:27.110]  it's the best I've ever done but
[01:42:27.110 --> 01:42:29.110]  you know at the same time it's this is
[01:42:29.110 --> 01:42:31.110]  a whole new way of life
[01:42:31.110 --> 01:42:33.110]  this is you know this is thinking
[01:42:33.110 --> 01:42:35.110]  through things that you never even considered
[01:42:35.110 --> 01:42:37.110]  before and you know what
[01:42:37.110 --> 01:42:39.110]  you know even though wife does make a lot of money
[01:42:39.110 --> 01:42:41.110]  I've still got to make something you know
[01:42:41.250 --> 01:42:43.250]  I'm like you can't live solely on that what if something happens
[01:42:43.250 --> 01:42:45.250]  you know she works for a fortune 50
[01:42:45.250 --> 01:42:47.250]  company you know how corporations work
[01:42:47.250 --> 01:42:49.250]  I'm gonna get a call tomorrow you're done
[01:42:49.250 --> 01:42:51.250]  then what you know
[01:42:51.250 --> 01:42:53.250]  I'm putting that on the line
[01:42:53.250 --> 01:42:55.250]  there's a lot of weight to that so
[01:42:55.250 --> 01:42:57.250]  something to consider
[01:42:57.250 --> 01:42:59.250]  overall though I'm more happy now
[01:42:59.250 --> 01:43:01.250]  than I ever was working for somebody else though
[01:43:01.250 --> 01:43:03.250]  boom that was gonna be the question I asked
[01:43:03.250 --> 01:43:05.250]  do you regret it no you do not
[01:43:05.250 --> 01:43:07.250]  not a bit
[01:43:07.390 --> 01:43:09.390]  and I want
[01:43:09.390 --> 01:43:11.390]  if London's on there I'd love to bring you on sir
[01:43:11.390 --> 01:43:13.390]  I know you're kind of going through the journey
[01:43:13.390 --> 01:43:15.390]  I feel like I'm going through the journey
[01:43:15.390 --> 01:43:17.390]  there's a lot more individuals that are going through the journey
[01:43:17.390 --> 01:43:19.390]  within the last few years
[01:43:19.390 --> 01:43:21.390]  of finding their own way
[01:43:21.390 --> 01:43:23.390]  you know you've you're doing the show
[01:43:23.390 --> 01:43:25.390]  sir you got the expos
[01:43:25.390 --> 01:43:27.390]  and the I wouldn't even know
[01:43:27.390 --> 01:43:29.390]  what you would call it events
[01:43:29.390 --> 01:43:31.390]  like prestigious events
[01:43:31.390 --> 01:43:33.390]  that it seems like you're covering
[01:43:33.390 --> 01:43:35.390]  you've been able to monetize
[01:43:35.530 --> 01:43:37.530]  those things you know we haven't even done that
[01:43:37.530 --> 01:43:39.530]  so you have a certain skill set
[01:43:39.530 --> 01:43:41.530]  that I think more individuals
[01:43:41.530 --> 01:43:43.530]  I think need to hear from you
[01:43:43.530 --> 01:43:45.530]  buddy because there's
[01:43:45.530 --> 01:43:47.530]  it's almost like it doesn't seem like
[01:43:47.530 --> 01:43:49.530]  it's tangible until one day it is
[01:43:49.530 --> 01:43:51.530]  and then once you see for
[01:43:51.530 --> 01:43:53.530]  yourself you have that confidence you know what I can
[01:43:53.530 --> 01:43:55.530]  make some money doing this and hustle maybe
[01:43:55.530 --> 01:43:57.530]  in a different way that maybe
[01:43:57.530 --> 01:43:59.530]  I never thought of before but
[01:43:59.530 --> 01:44:01.530]  some of the principles are still the same get your
[01:44:01.530 --> 01:44:03.530]  branding out there you know your word is
[01:44:03.670 --> 01:44:05.670]  your bond there's a lot of stuff that goes a long way
[01:44:05.670 --> 01:44:07.670]  and I wanted to give London
[01:44:07.670 --> 01:44:09.670]  the platform because he's kind of really
[01:44:09.670 --> 01:44:11.670]  you know if you were a rapper buddy
[01:44:11.670 --> 01:44:13.670]  this is like you know you'd be on the cover of
[01:44:13.670 --> 01:44:15.670]  a few magazines stuff you've kind of come out
[01:44:15.670 --> 01:44:17.670]  this year interviewing some of the best
[01:44:17.670 --> 01:44:19.670]  and brightest in the cannabis industry
[01:44:19.670 --> 01:44:21.670]  yeah man
[01:44:21.670 --> 01:44:23.670]  I'm like that weird dude that pokes
[01:44:23.670 --> 01:44:25.670]  people until they say yes
[01:44:25.670 --> 01:44:27.670]  and they'll come along for the journey
[01:44:27.670 --> 01:44:29.670]  but yeah you know what
[01:44:29.670 --> 01:44:31.670]  Sheldon I'm in the same boat as you man
[01:44:31.810 --> 01:44:33.810]  it's been a long hard year
[01:44:33.810 --> 01:44:35.810]  last couple years have been long and hard
[01:44:35.810 --> 01:44:37.810]  and figuring it all out has been even more
[01:44:37.810 --> 01:44:39.810]  challenging I have two kids wiggling around in the background
[01:44:39.810 --> 01:44:41.810]  trying to do that at the same time I have
[01:44:41.810 --> 01:44:43.810]  a wife that works in the restaurant industry
[01:44:43.810 --> 01:44:45.810]  and that makes her really good money she's a server
[01:44:45.810 --> 01:44:47.810]  so she works minimal hours and makes bank
[01:44:47.810 --> 01:44:49.810]  so it allows us to be able to
[01:44:49.810 --> 01:44:51.810]  have a little bit easier of a functioning lifestyle
[01:44:51.810 --> 01:44:53.810]  but it's been tight man and things
[01:44:53.810 --> 01:44:55.810]  haven't been super easy trying to figure out how
[01:44:55.810 --> 01:44:57.810]  to turn that work into dollars
[01:44:57.810 --> 01:44:59.810]  is hard especially when
[01:44:59.950 --> 01:45:01.950]  you want to keep a couple
[01:45:01.950 --> 01:45:03.950]  ethic points involved
[01:45:03.950 --> 01:45:05.950]  it's really easy to drop everything
[01:45:05.950 --> 01:45:07.950]  you want to do and
[01:45:07.950 --> 01:45:09.950]  compromise yourself but there's a
[01:45:09.950 --> 01:45:11.950]  certain integrity that needs to
[01:45:11.950 --> 01:45:13.950]  be maintained to
[01:45:13.950 --> 01:45:15.950]  ensure that you're gonna
[01:45:15.950 --> 01:45:17.950]  have cause I mean like Brian and Marco
[01:45:17.950 --> 01:45:19.950]  you guys are long
[01:45:19.950 --> 01:45:21.950]  haul veterans
[01:45:21.950 --> 01:45:23.950]  you're doing this and you're gonna be doing
[01:45:23.950 --> 01:45:25.950]  it whether it was cool or not whether it
[01:45:25.950 --> 01:45:27.950]  was interesting or weird like when Marco the first video
[01:45:28.090 --> 01:45:30.090]  I ever saw of you was you just dipping your feet
[01:45:30.090 --> 01:45:32.090]  in a giant batch of IMO
[01:45:32.090 --> 01:45:34.090]  like it was just like you were
[01:45:34.090 --> 01:45:36.090]  bathing in it and I loved it
[01:45:36.090 --> 01:45:38.090]  it was like the best time you've ever
[01:45:38.090 --> 01:45:40.090]  had and that was
[01:45:40.090 --> 01:45:42.090]  great so trying to figure out how to make money
[01:45:42.090 --> 01:45:44.090]  out of it has been challenging
[01:45:44.090 --> 01:45:46.090]  but it's starting to line up now
[01:45:46.090 --> 01:45:48.090]  and figuring out those things you just gotta say
[01:45:48.090 --> 01:45:50.090]  there's a couple things that I think you said that are
[01:45:50.090 --> 01:45:52.090]  really important it's like holding true to your word
[01:45:52.090 --> 01:45:54.090]  and doing what you need to be
[01:45:54.090 --> 01:45:56.090]  but you have to hold other people
[01:45:56.230 --> 01:45:58.230]  to that standard just as well
[01:45:58.230 --> 01:46:00.230]  it is so important
[01:46:00.230 --> 01:46:02.230]  and dedicated
[01:46:02.230 --> 01:46:04.230]  and yet also have to like really
[01:46:04.230 --> 01:46:06.230]  you know it takes a certain amount
[01:46:06.230 --> 01:46:08.230]  of maturity to run
[01:46:08.230 --> 01:46:10.230]  your own business and to be
[01:46:10.230 --> 01:46:12.230]  intelligent enough to
[01:46:12.230 --> 01:46:14.230]  take a pause before every statement
[01:46:14.230 --> 01:46:16.230]  before every word and look at what you're gonna say
[01:46:16.230 --> 01:46:18.230]  and analyze how that's gonna be recognize the people
[01:46:18.230 --> 01:46:20.230]  that are in the room recognize how you're gonna be
[01:46:20.230 --> 01:46:22.230]  talking to and surrounding yourself with them
[01:46:22.230 --> 01:46:24.230]  it's so fucking
[01:46:24.370 --> 01:46:26.370]  hard right Marco?
[01:46:26.370 --> 01:46:28.370]  it's not easy man but stand next
[01:46:28.370 --> 01:46:30.370]  to the biggest fish in the room
[01:46:30.370 --> 01:46:32.370]  you know have that
[01:46:32.370 --> 01:46:34.370]  conversation with that person and surround
[01:46:34.370 --> 01:46:36.370]  yourself with those people because if you're surrounded
[01:46:36.370 --> 01:46:38.370]  by the best of the best
[01:46:38.370 --> 01:46:40.370]  you'll just get better
[01:46:40.370 --> 01:46:42.370]  it's been a steep up curve I'm lucky enough
[01:46:42.370 --> 01:46:44.370]  that I have three doctors on the regular on one
[01:46:44.370 --> 01:46:46.370]  of my shows so I get to like talk to them on the regular
[01:46:46.370 --> 01:46:48.370]  so if I have a question about extraction
[01:46:48.370 --> 01:46:50.370]  I get to call up Dr. Mark
[01:46:50.370 --> 01:46:52.370]  and with that being said I think one of
[01:46:52.510 --> 01:46:54.510]  the most important things that you guys put forward on this show
[01:46:54.510 --> 01:46:56.510]  and that this whole community
[01:46:56.510 --> 01:46:58.510]  embolizes is community
[01:46:58.510 --> 01:47:00.510]  you have to work together
[01:47:00.510 --> 01:47:02.510]  it's about forming community and like you said
[01:47:02.510 --> 01:47:04.510]  you're not an event organizer
[01:47:04.510 --> 01:47:06.510]  and your first event didn't go great well like
[01:47:06.510 --> 01:47:08.510]  neither am I I'm terrible at that
[01:47:08.510 --> 01:47:10.510]  but I'm gonna find someone that's really good at that
[01:47:10.510 --> 01:47:12.510]  and then either get them to do it
[01:47:12.510 --> 01:47:14.510]  or just leech you know like
[01:47:14.510 --> 01:47:16.510]  I wanna add some value to what you're doing
[01:47:16.510 --> 01:47:18.510]  and 90% of the time they say yes
[01:47:18.510 --> 01:47:20.510]  because that's the community that we work in
[01:47:20.650 --> 01:47:22.650]  and that way you can get step by step
[01:47:22.650 --> 01:47:24.650]  instead of having to take a bigger
[01:47:24.650 --> 01:47:26.650]  apple than you like to chew
[01:47:26.650 --> 01:47:28.650]  we're looking at potentially doing
[01:47:28.650 --> 01:47:30.650]  the first future cannabis project summit
[01:47:30.650 --> 01:47:32.650]  in the next year
[01:47:32.650 --> 01:47:34.650]  a full digital summit on an event
[01:47:34.650 --> 01:47:36.650]  it's gonna be very very cool
[01:47:36.650 --> 01:47:38.650]  and it is like
[01:47:38.650 --> 01:47:40.650]  you know little pre-tittle tattles
[01:47:40.650 --> 01:47:42.650]  this is not fully announced yet
[01:47:42.650 --> 01:47:44.650]  but we're looking at doing some really cool stuff
[01:47:44.650 --> 01:47:46.650]  and I wouldn't have been able to do it without
[01:47:46.650 --> 01:47:48.650]  last year of like burning and turning
[01:47:48.790 --> 01:47:50.790]  and making some mistakes and having some issues
[01:47:50.790 --> 01:47:52.790]  and having some challenges
[01:47:52.790 --> 01:47:54.790]  and stuff like that you gotta screw around
[01:47:54.790 --> 01:47:56.790]  and it sounds like you have a lovely wife to help support
[01:47:56.790 --> 01:47:58.790]  you and a community to do the same
[01:47:58.790 --> 01:48:00.790]  so it's you know you just gotta
[01:48:00.790 --> 01:48:02.790]  grind out for a little bit and you'll get there
[01:48:02.790 --> 01:48:04.790]  I think
[01:48:04.790 --> 01:48:06.790]  especially looking like later in life
[01:48:06.790 --> 01:48:08.790]  getting older having
[01:48:08.790 --> 01:48:10.790]  a lady and having that respect
[01:48:10.790 --> 01:48:12.790]  of like alright you know you and I are now
[01:48:12.790 --> 01:48:14.790]  against the world instead of you know
[01:48:14.790 --> 01:48:16.790]  especially when you're younger it feels like you're against the world
[01:48:16.930 --> 01:48:18.930]  you know especially if you're making bad mistakes
[01:48:18.930 --> 01:48:20.930]  monetary things
[01:48:20.930 --> 01:48:22.930]  you know everybody's
[01:48:22.930 --> 01:48:24.930]  it's hard to make money and it's easy to make money it seems like in life
[01:48:24.930 --> 01:48:26.930]  and then it's hard to make money sometimes
[01:48:26.930 --> 01:48:28.930]  and it's easy I mean there's
[01:48:28.930 --> 01:48:30.930]  an ebb and flow or at least that's how
[01:48:30.930 --> 01:48:32.930]  it's been for me
[01:48:32.930 --> 01:48:34.930]  and so when I've started to later on
[01:48:34.930 --> 01:48:36.930]  get older it does seem like
[01:48:36.930 --> 01:48:38.930]  having that lady that right hand
[01:48:38.930 --> 01:48:40.930]  lady on your side and it's kind of
[01:48:40.930 --> 01:48:42.930]  just be in there for you whether it's
[01:48:42.930 --> 01:48:44.930]  you know just your support system
[01:48:45.070 --> 01:48:47.070]  or just believing in you
[01:48:47.070 --> 01:48:49.070]  just go ahead and do that
[01:48:49.070 --> 01:48:51.070]  I got you while you're focusing on these things
[01:48:51.070 --> 01:48:53.070]  that again to me
[01:48:53.070 --> 01:48:55.070]  is like one of those outlier moments that
[01:48:55.070 --> 01:48:57.070]  we talked about before like it's such a
[01:48:57.070 --> 01:48:59.070]  rare thing probably to be able to
[01:48:59.070 --> 01:49:01.070]  have that moment so not only
[01:49:01.070 --> 01:49:03.070]  do you have that moment but you're taking the
[01:49:03.070 --> 01:49:05.070]  steps to be able to seize that opportunity
[01:49:05.070 --> 01:49:07.070]  and I don't think that happens
[01:49:07.070 --> 01:49:09.070]  many times in your life
[01:49:09.070 --> 01:49:11.070]  so if people are seeing that
[01:49:11.070 --> 01:49:13.070]  for yourself today or hopefully in 2023
[01:49:13.210 --> 01:49:15.210]  or in the future please take
[01:49:15.210 --> 01:49:17.210]  hold of that because I
[01:49:17.210 --> 01:49:19.210]  think that finding your own way
[01:49:19.210 --> 01:49:21.210]  is scary but at the same
[01:49:21.210 --> 01:49:23.210]  time taking those reins and now being able
[01:49:23.210 --> 01:49:25.210]  to talk to your wife
[01:49:25.210 --> 01:49:27.210]  hey I have this idea but I
[01:49:27.210 --> 01:49:29.210]  would love to get it by you
[01:49:29.210 --> 01:49:31.210]  and just keeping her in the loop I think
[01:49:31.210 --> 01:49:33.210]  is another fantastic
[01:49:33.210 --> 01:49:35.210]  way to know that she's behind you still
[01:49:35.210 --> 01:49:37.210]  so maybe it didn't work out exactly where
[01:49:37.210 --> 01:49:39.210]  you wanted it to be Sheldon to be honest
[01:49:39.210 --> 01:49:41.210]  buddy when I first started
[01:49:41.230 --> 01:49:43.230]  I was so afraid of even rubber duckies
[01:49:43.230 --> 01:49:45.230]  I mean it doesn't nothing
[01:49:45.230 --> 01:49:47.230]  takes off the way that you'd hope it
[01:49:47.230 --> 01:49:49.230]  would but at the same time
[01:49:49.230 --> 01:49:51.230]  that slow drip to me is
[01:49:51.230 --> 01:49:53.230]  something that might be
[01:49:53.230 --> 01:49:55.230]  the journey and the things that it's
[01:49:55.230 --> 01:49:57.230]  worth putting in the time and effort because
[01:49:57.230 --> 01:49:59.230]  now that slow drip becomes a little bit of
[01:49:59.230 --> 01:50:01.230]  a leak and then that leak you know the
[01:50:01.230 --> 01:50:03.230]  water faucets turned on
[01:50:03.230 --> 01:50:05.230]  so that the abundance
[01:50:05.230 --> 01:50:07.230]  starts to come your way and I truly
[01:50:07.230 --> 01:50:09.230]  believe that when you stay on that
[01:50:09.230 --> 01:50:10.910]  Eventually abundance comes your way.
[01:50:10.910 --> 01:50:13.190]  Eventually abundance comes London's way.
[01:50:13.190 --> 01:50:15.030]  Eventually abundance comes Marco's way.
[01:50:15.030 --> 01:50:16.750]  And to be honest, Marco,
[01:50:16.750 --> 01:50:18.550]  I think that might've happened for you earlier.
[01:50:18.550 --> 01:50:19.390]  You know what I mean?
[01:50:19.390 --> 01:50:23.030]  You have the ability to continue to improve on things
[01:50:23.030 --> 01:50:24.470]  and you have your career
[01:50:24.470 --> 01:50:26.390]  and it seems like you have a full-time job
[01:50:26.390 --> 01:50:29.510]  just being a social media individual.
[01:50:29.510 --> 01:50:32.350]  So if you guys notice in the audience,
[01:50:32.350 --> 01:50:34.550]  these individuals never stop,
[01:50:34.550 --> 01:50:36.630]  in a way almost never stopped working.
[01:50:36.630 --> 01:50:38.810]  And London Behind the Scenes is running this show
[01:50:38.810 --> 01:50:40.510]  with a Hail Mary pass today.
[01:50:40.510 --> 01:50:42.610]  And I think that's the kind of stuff,
[01:50:42.610 --> 01:50:45.370]  the work ethic that a lot of people don't realize
[01:50:45.370 --> 01:50:46.210]  behind the scenes,
[01:50:46.210 --> 01:50:49.050]  that's what people are doing day in and day out.
[01:50:49.050 --> 01:50:50.930]  You might not necessarily see it,
[01:50:50.930 --> 01:50:53.530]  but that's what it's gonna take to achieve anything.
[01:50:53.530 --> 01:50:55.010]  And again, if you've never read the book,
[01:50:55.010 --> 01:50:57.090]  Outlier, Malcolm Gladwell,
[01:50:57.090 --> 01:50:58.410]  there's something to that secret
[01:50:58.410 --> 01:51:00.330]  where he talks about 10,000 hours.
[01:51:00.330 --> 01:51:02.330]  So I think Sheldon, you're just on your journey, bro,
[01:51:02.330 --> 01:51:03.770]  to the 10,000 hours.
[01:51:03.770 --> 01:51:05.130]  Same thing with London.
[01:51:05.130 --> 01:51:08.090]  And I'm hoping to also be on that journey, you know?
[01:51:08.970 --> 01:51:13.490]  Marco, to me, you took your 10,000 hours for your career.
[01:51:13.490 --> 01:51:15.210]  So you already got that, brother.
[01:51:15.210 --> 01:51:16.230]  And then you're like, you know what?
[01:51:16.230 --> 01:51:17.930]  I'm gonna almost like double major
[01:51:17.930 --> 01:51:19.850]  or whatever the best analogy would be for that.
[01:51:19.850 --> 01:51:23.630]  I'm gonna also go down this rabbit hole of natural farming,
[01:51:23.630 --> 01:51:25.850]  and I'm gonna also get those 10,000 hours
[01:51:25.850 --> 01:51:27.210]  in this lifetime as well.
[01:51:28.210 --> 01:51:30.010]  Man, you ain't lying, Brian.
[01:51:30.010 --> 01:51:31.610]  And that's what happened was,
[01:51:31.610 --> 01:51:35.530]  I got, when I was, how old are you, Sheldon?
[01:51:36.490 --> 01:51:37.330]  30?
[01:51:38.570 --> 01:51:39.770]  All right, he muted.
[01:51:39.770 --> 01:51:41.050]  Yeah, you're muted, buddy.
[01:51:41.050 --> 01:51:43.090]  My bad, I'll be 30 next month.
[01:51:43.090 --> 01:51:45.230]  All right, boom, so you're about to be 30.
[01:51:46.370 --> 01:51:48.330]  Perfect, that's a wonderful age.
[01:51:48.330 --> 01:51:51.410]  What I did, though, man, I just grinded.
[01:51:51.410 --> 01:51:53.810]  Like, I got into this career and stuck,
[01:51:53.810 --> 01:51:55.890]  and I'm stuck with it until,
[01:51:55.890 --> 01:51:58.090]  to this day, I'm still in it.
[01:51:58.090 --> 01:52:00.810]  But what I did was, and I said, all right, man,
[01:52:00.810 --> 01:52:02.610]  I've kind of gone far enough in this.
[01:52:02.610 --> 01:52:04.130]  Now I need an exit.
[01:52:04.810 --> 01:52:08.370]  When I'm done with construction, I wanna do something else.
[01:52:08.370 --> 01:52:11.970]  So I'm fading into this natural farming phase of my life.
[01:52:11.970 --> 01:52:13.770]  Like, I'm 48, but I've been doing this,
[01:52:13.770 --> 01:52:16.490]  going, this'll be going on my 24th year.
[01:52:16.490 --> 01:52:18.250]  I mean, it's coming up.
[01:52:18.250 --> 01:52:22.250]  And just today, woke up fucking four something,
[01:52:22.250 --> 01:52:25.290]  jumped in my truck, drove three hours,
[01:52:25.290 --> 01:52:30.290]  walked the job site with my superintendent for two hours,
[01:52:30.410 --> 01:52:32.610]  and then from there, went on up to the office.
[01:52:32.650 --> 01:52:34.250]  From there, got off, came here,
[01:52:34.250 --> 01:52:36.130]  and now I'm doing this for three hours.
[01:52:36.130 --> 01:52:36.970]  You know what I mean?
[01:52:36.970 --> 01:52:40.650]  So I was kind of like, damn, do we have a show today?
[01:52:40.650 --> 01:52:41.770]  I kind of hope we don't,
[01:52:41.770 --> 01:52:43.450]  because I'd like to be in this hotel room,
[01:52:43.450 --> 01:52:46.190]  like, sleeping, you know, getting a nice nap.
[01:52:46.190 --> 01:52:47.650]  But, you know, we had the show, man,
[01:52:47.650 --> 01:52:50.570]  and I was like, fuck it, let's go ahead and have the show.
[01:52:50.570 --> 01:52:53.050]  And I like what you said, Brian, at 10,000 hours,
[01:52:53.050 --> 01:52:55.070]  because a lot of, you hear that from the comedians, too.
[01:52:55.070 --> 01:52:57.170]  They say that you gotta do, like, that stand-up
[01:52:57.170 --> 01:52:58.970]  at 10,000 hours.
[01:52:58.970 --> 01:53:02.510]  And yeah, man, so you can do two things.
[01:53:03.410 --> 01:53:04.250]  You can be parallel, you know,
[01:53:04.250 --> 01:53:06.910]  but you have to, doing something parallel
[01:53:06.910 --> 01:53:08.830]  is a little bit more work, you know what I mean?
[01:53:08.830 --> 01:53:10.750]  Because I'm now doing that work,
[01:53:10.750 --> 01:53:13.170]  but then you're also gonna do this parallel thing.
[01:53:13.170 --> 01:53:15.550]  So it's kind of double, double the amount of work.
[01:53:15.550 --> 01:53:18.030]  But you do that shit when you're young.
[01:53:18.030 --> 01:53:19.310]  Like, I always said that, man,
[01:53:19.310 --> 01:53:21.730]  work hard when you're young, and then,
[01:53:21.730 --> 01:53:24.230]  because when you get older, you can't physically work hard.
[01:53:24.230 --> 01:53:27.310]  So if you got physical shit, get that out the way early.
[01:53:27.310 --> 01:53:29.190]  You know, and then when you get older,
[01:53:29.190 --> 01:53:30.670]  your body can rest a little bit,
[01:53:30.670 --> 01:53:31.910]  use a little more of your mind.
[01:53:32.910 --> 01:53:35.630]  They don't need me, they don't got me for my physical.
[01:53:35.630 --> 01:53:38.510]  Like, I'm not picking up shit and stalling it,
[01:53:38.510 --> 01:53:39.350]  you know what I mean?
[01:53:39.350 --> 01:53:42.110]  Now it's about my mind, but there was a stage in my life
[01:53:42.110 --> 01:53:45.730]  when that was me, picking up shit and stalling shit,
[01:53:45.730 --> 01:53:48.070]  you know, being that guy, listening to somebody else
[01:53:48.070 --> 01:53:50.170]  telling me, you know, to install that.
[01:53:50.170 --> 01:53:55.170]  And what happens is, like London said,
[01:53:55.230 --> 01:53:57.550]  you, I got a friend named Landon.
[01:53:57.550 --> 01:53:59.030]  So what happens is-
[01:53:59.030 --> 01:54:00.950]  Oh, you're gonna have so much trouble.
[01:54:00.950 --> 01:54:03.270]  It's gonna happen.
[01:54:03.270 --> 01:54:05.910]  I just think England with you, London.
[01:54:05.910 --> 01:54:07.510]  What happens is you just keep working
[01:54:07.510 --> 01:54:10.070]  and you end up working yourself through these things.
[01:54:10.070 --> 01:54:13.310]  Like you work, oh shit, I'm past the physical labor side.
[01:54:13.310 --> 01:54:14.590]  Like I've done work through it.
[01:54:14.590 --> 01:54:17.230]  Like, and it's weird, it just happens, man.
[01:54:17.230 --> 01:54:20.150]  But it happens only when you kind of keep grinding.
[01:54:20.150 --> 01:54:22.270]  And sometimes you stop and look, damn,
[01:54:22.270 --> 01:54:23.670]  I've done okay for myself.
[01:54:23.670 --> 01:54:26.670]  Like Marco, the knucklehead that was, you know,
[01:54:26.710 --> 01:54:28.470]  used to like to cause trouble.
[01:54:28.470 --> 01:54:31.030]  And, you know, like I'm still that guy,
[01:54:31.030 --> 01:54:34.270]  but I've grown into being the man I am today.
[01:54:34.270 --> 01:54:37.350]  And really the hard work is what does that, man.
[01:54:37.350 --> 01:54:39.630]  Like you can't really cut corners.
[01:54:39.630 --> 01:54:41.390]  That's my biggest advice.
[01:54:43.210 --> 01:54:44.050]  Well said, man.
[01:54:44.050 --> 01:54:46.790]  It's the, it's discipline, you know.
[01:54:46.790 --> 01:54:48.190]  It's not even getting up and doing it.
[01:54:48.190 --> 01:54:49.750]  It's just showing up and doing it
[01:54:49.750 --> 01:54:51.510]  even when you don't want to.
[01:54:51.510 --> 01:54:54.470]  And I think a lot of individuals,
[01:54:54.710 --> 01:54:56.710]  they just never are going to experience that
[01:54:56.710 --> 01:54:58.590]  at any length or volume.
[01:54:58.590 --> 01:55:01.230]  And so it's a lot easier to compete
[01:55:01.230 --> 01:55:02.950]  if you're willing to put in the time and effort,
[01:55:02.950 --> 01:55:04.310]  build your own brand,
[01:55:04.310 --> 01:55:07.310]  knowing that other entrepreneurs are not doing that.
[01:55:07.310 --> 01:55:10.710]  And so I forget, there's some billionaire
[01:55:10.710 --> 01:55:12.790]  that I was talking about when he first started out.
[01:55:12.790 --> 01:55:14.030]  He just woke up every day,
[01:55:14.030 --> 01:55:16.350]  like somebody was out to eat his lunch for him.
[01:55:16.350 --> 01:55:17.190]  And I don't know why,
[01:55:17.190 --> 01:55:20.270]  but that always stuck in the back of my head of like,
[01:55:20.270 --> 01:55:21.710]  there is gonna always be somebody.
[01:55:21.710 --> 01:55:23.750]  If you're making money at something,
[01:55:23.790 --> 01:55:24.910]  no matter what it is,
[01:55:24.910 --> 01:55:26.990]  there's gonna be somebody seeing you making money
[01:55:26.990 --> 01:55:29.110]  doing that and then starting to copy
[01:55:29.110 --> 01:55:30.910]  whether they let you know it or not.
[01:55:30.910 --> 01:55:33.770]  And so if you're continuing to move forward in that pace
[01:55:33.770 --> 01:55:35.370]  and always staying forward,
[01:55:35.370 --> 01:55:37.870]  I think that's something to remember in life
[01:55:37.870 --> 01:55:38.990]  as well as like when you're starting
[01:55:38.990 --> 01:55:40.270]  to build up your business.
[01:55:40.270 --> 01:55:41.750]  And Sheldon, I have no doubt, dude,
[01:55:41.750 --> 01:55:44.650]  with the way that you just explain things in your videos,
[01:55:44.650 --> 01:55:46.910]  the way you are as a human being,
[01:55:46.910 --> 01:55:49.010]  that you just gotta get your 10,000 hours,
[01:55:49.010 --> 01:55:50.370]  get yourself out there.
[01:55:50.370 --> 01:55:52.790]  And I think that journey is again, one of those things.
[01:55:52.830 --> 01:55:54.390]  When we first started the show about like,
[01:55:54.390 --> 01:55:56.950]  oh, when you put your boxes out there, you fail.
[01:55:56.950 --> 01:55:59.470]  I think entrepreneurship is kind of that same way.
[01:55:59.470 --> 01:56:00.990]  Hey man, I'm just looking to get out there
[01:56:00.990 --> 01:56:02.330]  and get a couple at bats,
[01:56:02.330 --> 01:56:04.650]  start getting some singles, maybe some doubles out there.
[01:56:04.650 --> 01:56:07.670]  People chant my name, maybe buying a jersey or two.
[01:56:07.670 --> 01:56:09.030]  And then once I'm an entrepreneur
[01:56:09.030 --> 01:56:10.770]  and people wanna buy my brand,
[01:56:11.950 --> 01:56:13.590]  then you kind of are able to kind of take it
[01:56:13.590 --> 01:56:16.030]  to the next level because people recognize that brand.
[01:56:16.030 --> 01:56:18.230]  And then you can start to see what people want from you.
[01:56:18.230 --> 01:56:20.910]  I mean, the customer will literally tell you that.
[01:56:20.910 --> 01:56:22.870]  I felt like I've learned that from hustling weed
[01:56:22.870 --> 01:56:26.110]  all the way to now selling roly polies.
[01:56:26.110 --> 01:56:27.790]  They come up to you at expos.
[01:56:27.790 --> 01:56:28.750]  Hey, do you sell this?
[01:56:28.750 --> 01:56:30.190]  Hey, do you sell that?
[01:56:30.190 --> 01:56:32.590]  If you're not listening to those kinds of customers,
[01:56:32.590 --> 01:56:34.830]  then you're missing out on revenue.
[01:56:34.830 --> 01:56:37.350]  And especially when you're a beginner entrepreneur,
[01:56:37.350 --> 01:56:40.470]  every dollar matters, every customer matters.
[01:56:40.470 --> 01:56:43.390]  And bringing back as I hope it becomes a motto
[01:56:43.390 --> 01:56:46.810]  for this channel is the only business is repeat business.
[01:56:46.810 --> 01:56:48.590]  So how do we continue to build that up?
[01:56:48.590 --> 01:56:50.830]  We gotta build that Rolodex the same way we used to
[01:56:51.650 --> 01:56:52.490]  in the hustling days.
[01:56:52.490 --> 01:56:54.110]  It's just now we want those people to come see us
[01:56:54.110 --> 01:56:57.670]  at the expos or reach out to us on social media
[01:56:57.670 --> 01:56:59.350]  for doing these kinds of things.
[01:56:59.350 --> 01:57:01.230]  I think put time and effort,
[01:57:01.230 --> 01:57:04.150]  this kind of stuff comes back to you tenfold
[01:57:04.150 --> 01:57:06.070]  months from now, a year from now.
[01:57:06.070 --> 01:57:07.830]  And that's just the way it is.
[01:57:07.830 --> 01:57:10.710]  I think karma chooses to work slowly
[01:57:10.710 --> 01:57:12.670]  because it's pretty sweet, man.
[01:57:12.670 --> 01:57:15.550]  When things start to churn and change in your life
[01:57:15.550 --> 01:57:18.350]  from being maybe a smarter human being
[01:57:18.350 --> 01:57:20.530]  and understanding on a karmic level,
[01:57:21.230 --> 01:57:22.050]  I gotta get my shit together
[01:57:22.050 --> 01:57:25.750]  and then I'm gonna move forward and find my own way.
[01:57:27.810 --> 01:57:30.250]  Bad goes the same way too, guys.
[01:57:30.250 --> 01:57:32.010]  Like good works like that,
[01:57:32.010 --> 01:57:34.570]  but bad can work like that too in your life.
[01:57:34.570 --> 01:57:37.530]  Like you can get into a zone where damn,
[01:57:37.530 --> 01:57:39.930]  another bad thing, another bad thing, another bad thing.
[01:57:39.930 --> 01:57:42.890]  So try to ride that wave of positivity.
[01:57:42.890 --> 01:57:45.290]  You know, like Brian was saying, that's key for me.
[01:57:45.290 --> 01:57:46.810]  It's keep it positive.
[01:57:46.810 --> 01:57:48.130]  And a lot of times you think, man,
[01:57:48.130 --> 01:57:49.970]  I'm about to just give up on this shit.
[01:57:50.410 --> 01:57:52.010]  And right when you think you're about to give up
[01:57:52.010 --> 01:57:53.930]  on something is when something breaks through.
[01:57:53.930 --> 01:57:54.770]  You know what I mean?
[01:57:54.770 --> 01:57:58.970]  So that's why I kind of keep grinding, keep positive.
[01:57:58.970 --> 01:58:00.410]  If I can jump in too, man.
[01:58:00.410 --> 01:58:02.530]  If you're running into challenges
[01:58:02.530 --> 01:58:06.050]  doing something you're doing, it means it's novel.
[01:58:06.050 --> 01:58:08.330]  It means you're the one doing it first, right?
[01:58:08.330 --> 01:58:10.970]  If there's a ton of challenges and nobody else
[01:58:10.970 --> 01:58:13.690]  is there to help you find your way
[01:58:13.690 --> 01:58:16.610]  or help you dig through the crap or this type of thing,
[01:58:16.610 --> 01:58:18.890]  like you're doing something novel,
[01:58:18.890 --> 01:58:20.930]  then that's a good sign that you should keep going.
[01:58:20.930 --> 01:58:24.930]  You know, and as human beings, we have this,
[01:58:24.930 --> 01:58:26.450]  you know, I was a chef for 15 years
[01:58:26.450 --> 01:58:28.090]  and I trained at a Michelin star chef.
[01:58:28.090 --> 01:58:29.490]  So I worked all over the world.
[01:58:29.490 --> 01:58:32.770]  And one of the things that we do is we focus on the faults.
[01:58:32.770 --> 01:58:34.770]  Now there's nothing wrong with that,
[01:58:34.770 --> 01:58:36.810]  but you have to realize and take a moment
[01:58:36.810 --> 01:58:38.210]  every once in a while and take a breath
[01:58:38.210 --> 01:58:40.330]  that you're focusing, that your job,
[01:58:40.330 --> 01:58:42.570]  that your life is focusing on your challenges
[01:58:42.570 --> 01:58:44.450]  and your difficulties because we want to create
[01:58:44.450 --> 01:58:46.970]  better circumstances for ourself and the people around us.
[01:58:46.970 --> 01:58:47.850]  That's what we do.
[01:58:47.850 --> 01:58:48.970]  We focus on those things,
[01:58:48.970 --> 01:58:51.250]  but if we don't take a moment to step back
[01:58:51.250 --> 01:58:54.050]  and focus on all the good things that we're achieving
[01:58:54.050 --> 01:58:56.490]  and how we can go about keeping those good
[01:58:56.490 --> 01:58:58.330]  and maintaining those things,
[01:58:58.330 --> 01:59:01.170]  we either, you know, become ungrateful
[01:59:01.170 --> 01:59:02.770]  for the fact that we have them,
[01:59:02.770 --> 01:59:05.650]  or we get so focused on the negative
[01:59:05.650 --> 01:59:08.210]  that we feel like life is overly challenging.
[01:59:08.210 --> 01:59:10.490]  And when you realize how good these things are,
[01:59:10.490 --> 01:59:13.010]  all these challenges are just nothing.
[01:59:13.010 --> 01:59:14.570]  They're just nothing when it comes down to it
[01:59:14.570 --> 01:59:16.570]  because in five years, you won't even remember
[01:59:16.570 --> 01:59:19.050]  what the fuck happened that week in July
[01:59:19.050 --> 01:59:20.690]  that was fucking so terrible
[01:59:20.690 --> 01:59:22.690]  that you couldn't even get through it.
[01:59:22.690 --> 01:59:24.250]  Or you might remember it really, really well
[01:59:24.250 --> 01:59:25.210]  because that was the turning point
[01:59:25.210 --> 01:59:26.850]  that got you to the next state.
[01:59:29.010 --> 01:59:29.850]  That's good stuff.
[01:59:29.850 --> 01:59:30.770]  I'm with that.
[01:59:32.770 --> 01:59:34.810]  That's, I like that outlook, man,
[01:59:34.810 --> 01:59:36.250]  and I appreciate that a lot.
[01:59:38.090 --> 01:59:39.570]  I'm all about riding that positivity
[01:59:39.570 --> 01:59:41.010]  as much as possible for sure.
[01:59:43.370 --> 01:59:44.890]  There is the opposite of that a lot
[01:59:44.930 --> 01:59:47.170]  in entrepreneurship for sure.
[01:59:47.170 --> 01:59:49.010]  You know, not every day is easy to wake up
[01:59:49.010 --> 01:59:51.610]  and fight the same battle you've been fighting
[01:59:51.610 --> 01:59:53.090]  for the last two weeks every day
[01:59:53.090 --> 01:59:55.410]  with no sign of letting up.
[01:59:55.410 --> 01:59:58.130]  It takes a certain amount of discipline,
[01:59:58.130 --> 02:00:00.090]  but self-love at the end of the day,
[02:00:00.090 --> 02:00:01.570]  I think is what it comes down to.
[02:00:01.570 --> 02:00:02.810]  You gotta learn how to love yourself
[02:00:02.810 --> 02:00:04.410]  before you can love what you're doing.
[02:00:04.410 --> 02:00:07.850]  So that's been a main focus of mine
[02:00:07.850 --> 02:00:10.210]  since I really got into all this
[02:00:10.210 --> 02:00:12.810]  like natural farming stuff back in 2017
[02:00:12.810 --> 02:00:14.730]  is like how so many of the aspects
[02:00:15.570 --> 02:00:17.130]  of applying to my day-to-day life,
[02:00:17.130 --> 02:00:20.930]  you know, and just the IMO theory,
[02:00:20.930 --> 02:00:24.290]  you know, it's like there's 10% good,
[02:00:24.290 --> 02:00:27.890]  there's 10% bad, and then 80% are neutral.
[02:00:27.890 --> 02:00:30.050]  And that 80% is gonna shift towards
[02:00:30.050 --> 02:00:33.090]  whatever, you know, the situation is.
[02:00:33.090 --> 02:00:35.970]  Think of it as aerobic conditions versus anaerobic,
[02:00:35.970 --> 02:00:37.290]  you know, good and bad.
[02:00:37.290 --> 02:00:39.410]  The micro, 80% of those microorganisms
[02:00:39.410 --> 02:00:41.290]  that are living in that space are new,
[02:00:41.290 --> 02:00:42.570]  you can go either way.
[02:00:42.570 --> 02:00:45.890]  But you have control over, you know,
[02:00:45.890 --> 02:00:48.170]  which way it goes and just stuff like that.
[02:00:48.170 --> 02:00:49.610]  It might be silly to some people,
[02:00:49.610 --> 02:00:51.250]  but I replay those kind of things.
[02:00:51.250 --> 02:00:54.050]  And as I'm doing my work and loving what I do,
[02:00:54.050 --> 02:00:56.170]  I can think about these things as I'm doing it.
[02:00:56.170 --> 02:00:57.010]  And it feels good.
[02:00:57.010 --> 02:00:59.130]  It grounds me and brings me back down.
[02:00:59.130 --> 02:01:01.890]  Marco, you mentioned like the, excuse me,
[02:01:01.890 --> 02:01:04.410]  like the suicide thing and stuff like that.
[02:01:04.410 --> 02:01:06.290]  Like, that's serious stuff, dude.
[02:01:06.290 --> 02:01:10.210]  Like, you know, a lot of people have depression
[02:01:10.210 --> 02:01:12.290]  deeper than, you know, they might be willing to admit.
[02:01:13.010 --> 02:01:14.090]  And I think that, you know, being vulnerable
[02:01:14.090 --> 02:01:17.250]  and learning how to love yourself is absolutely crucial.
[02:01:18.690 --> 02:01:20.650]  Yes, yes it is, man.
[02:01:20.650 --> 02:01:24.330]  I had to switch mics, so hopefully I don't sound too crazy,
[02:01:24.330 --> 02:01:26.130]  but battery was dying.
[02:01:26.130 --> 02:01:28.730]  But yeah, man, this is great, man.
[02:01:28.730 --> 02:01:30.530]  Life lessons, you know what I mean?
[02:01:30.530 --> 02:01:33.730]  Just the biggest thing is that you won't lose
[02:01:33.730 --> 02:01:34.650]  if you don't quit.
[02:01:34.650 --> 02:01:35.770]  That was one of my sayings.
[02:01:35.770 --> 02:01:38.690]  Like, if I don't quit, I can't lose, right?
[02:01:38.690 --> 02:01:40.970]  Still in this, I'm still here, you know?
[02:01:40.970 --> 02:01:43.730]  So if I don't quit, I can't lose.
[02:01:43.730 --> 02:01:46.090]  So that's one of my lines.
[02:01:48.130 --> 02:01:50.650]  You know, around this time of year, it is pretty tough.
[02:01:50.650 --> 02:01:51.930]  Marco, you had mentioned that.
[02:01:51.930 --> 02:01:55.810]  And I don't think enough men talk about
[02:01:55.810 --> 02:01:57.450]  like the average dude, you know,
[02:01:57.450 --> 02:02:00.090]  just the average dude that goes to work,
[02:02:00.090 --> 02:02:01.890]  doesn't have a family,
[02:02:01.890 --> 02:02:06.890]  how actually like sad some of those individuals are.
[02:02:06.930 --> 02:02:10.130]  And being a man, they're not gonna tell anybody
[02:02:10.170 --> 02:02:11.130]  that they work or anything.
[02:02:11.130 --> 02:02:13.130]  They just kind of keep it to themselves.
[02:02:13.130 --> 02:02:14.690]  And I think that's that kind of stuff,
[02:02:14.690 --> 02:02:16.930]  especially when it comes around the holidays.
[02:02:17.810 --> 02:02:22.810]  So this is even kind of like,
[02:02:23.690 --> 02:02:25.970]  you know, I almost did that, you know what I mean?
[02:02:25.970 --> 02:02:29.850]  So it's kind of that band-aid kind of thing
[02:02:29.850 --> 02:02:31.370]  when you begin to talk about it,
[02:02:31.370 --> 02:02:32.650]  because you feel like, ah, I got this.
[02:02:32.650 --> 02:02:34.170]  I could say something about it.
[02:02:34.170 --> 02:02:37.050]  But when you're really facing that moment,
[02:02:37.050 --> 02:02:39.850]  I could understand why, Marco, when you brought that up,
[02:02:40.570 --> 02:02:42.090]  if somebody had done it, they regret it instantly
[02:02:42.090 --> 02:02:46.250]  because life is unbelievably sweet
[02:02:46.250 --> 02:02:49.930]  when you're not so focused on every little nitty gritty.
[02:02:49.930 --> 02:02:51.730]  And when you have a little bit of maybe abundance
[02:02:51.730 --> 02:02:54.170]  or time in your life, when shit happens to you,
[02:02:54.170 --> 02:02:56.490]  not everything is such an emergency.
[02:02:56.490 --> 02:02:59.410]  And I think because monetary things are so important,
[02:02:59.410 --> 02:03:01.410]  or it seems like it's driven into us
[02:03:01.410 --> 02:03:05.210]  to value it as such importance,
[02:03:05.210 --> 02:03:08.290]  that the years are going by, for me, at least even quicker
[02:03:08.290 --> 02:03:09.770]  as I'm starting to get older.
[02:03:10.570 --> 02:03:13.130]  So the real value in life, the things that were cherished,
[02:03:13.130 --> 02:03:15.810]  you know, I also love to think about, you know,
[02:03:15.810 --> 02:03:17.130]  the beginning race.
[02:03:17.130 --> 02:03:20.050]  We all won the fucking mega marathon race
[02:03:20.050 --> 02:03:22.730]  to get to the egg first.
[02:03:22.730 --> 02:03:26.770]  And so when you are having those negative thoughts,
[02:03:26.770 --> 02:03:28.530]  in a weird way, man, that was some of the stuff
[02:03:28.530 --> 02:03:30.850]  that I was thinking about when I had some of the down,
[02:03:30.850 --> 02:03:33.210]  and going out into the woods and just going,
[02:03:33.210 --> 02:03:35.130]  I can't recommend that enough, Marco.
[02:03:35.130 --> 02:03:38.410]  I mean, that was, that might even be more than a bar, dude,
[02:03:38.450 --> 02:03:42.050]  because when you're outside and you start to realize
[02:03:42.050 --> 02:03:45.530]  that nature is pretty fucking sweet, life is pretty sweet,
[02:03:45.530 --> 02:03:48.090]  it's pretty rare that you even get to be here.
[02:03:48.090 --> 02:03:50.810]  And some of us, the way that we've grown up,
[02:03:50.810 --> 02:03:53.890]  we're lucky that we were able to make it in certain spots,
[02:03:53.890 --> 02:03:56.850]  just to, that's just how life is sometimes.
[02:03:56.850 --> 02:03:58.450]  And the fact that we're even in America
[02:03:58.450 --> 02:04:02.410]  is on a whole nother level of security and safety
[02:04:02.410 --> 02:04:04.570]  compared to the average human being.
[02:04:04.570 --> 02:04:08.850]  So again, I just wanted to bring up that aspect
[02:04:08.850 --> 02:04:11.610]  because maybe we should have a show on that.
[02:04:11.610 --> 02:04:12.730]  Maybe we should talk about it,
[02:04:12.730 --> 02:04:14.570]  because I don't think enough dudes,
[02:04:14.570 --> 02:04:16.010]  when they're feeling that way,
[02:04:16.010 --> 02:04:17.850]  I didn't have a family at that time.
[02:04:17.850 --> 02:04:21.290]  I felt like everybody was a certain way about things.
[02:04:21.290 --> 02:04:24.010]  And when you're in that headspace
[02:04:24.010 --> 02:04:25.770]  and you're not talking to anybody,
[02:04:27.010 --> 02:04:29.930]  that is the issue, that is, I think, the potential issue.
[02:04:29.930 --> 02:04:32.450]  And I don't know if you guys wanna continue to talk on this,
[02:04:32.450 --> 02:04:34.450]  but since we're getting closer to Christmas,
[02:04:34.450 --> 02:04:37.330]  I just know that it's important to people to realize
[02:04:37.330 --> 02:04:39.530]  that there are a lot of us out there
[02:04:39.530 --> 02:04:41.610]  that have had those thoughts before.
[02:04:41.610 --> 02:04:43.650]  And thankfully, I think for myself,
[02:04:43.650 --> 02:04:47.290]  I could speak for myself, that that's never come about again.
[02:04:47.290 --> 02:04:50.090]  Like life is so fucking sweet now,
[02:04:50.090 --> 02:04:54.570]  and to have a child and now to have a child with my love.
[02:04:54.570 --> 02:04:56.850]  So I have my son, I have a stepson,
[02:04:56.850 --> 02:04:59.010]  and now a child with my wife.
[02:05:00.690 --> 02:05:01.650]  Those are the kind of things
[02:05:01.650 --> 02:05:03.570]  that I think you might not ever think about
[02:05:03.570 --> 02:05:04.730]  when you're in those moments,
[02:05:04.730 --> 02:05:06.490]  that that would even happen to you.
[02:05:06.490 --> 02:05:08.570]  And so I just wanted to give that to individuals
[02:05:08.570 --> 02:05:09.410]  that feel that way,
[02:05:09.410 --> 02:05:10.730]  because I know grown men,
[02:05:10.730 --> 02:05:12.650]  we never talk about this shit ever,
[02:05:12.650 --> 02:05:14.410]  and people just hold it deep inside.
[02:05:14.410 --> 02:05:17.010]  And I've seen some other podcasts that I admire
[02:05:17.010 --> 02:05:19.170]  where dudes are actually opening up about this,
[02:05:19.170 --> 02:05:21.890]  talking about how lonely they truly are
[02:05:21.890 --> 02:05:24.170]  because they are average individuals.
[02:05:24.170 --> 02:05:26.890]  And they, I don't know, I guess they own up to it.
[02:05:26.930 --> 02:05:31.770]  And there's some true sad individuals out there
[02:05:31.770 --> 02:05:34.050]  that have literally nobody to talk to.
[02:05:35.330 --> 02:05:36.890]  Sorry if that was a little too.
[02:05:36.890 --> 02:05:40.690]  Man, I spent, like I said, I was a chef for 15 years.
[02:05:40.690 --> 02:05:42.210]  I was crazy ambitious.
[02:05:42.210 --> 02:05:44.650]  I worked my ass off every day.
[02:05:44.650 --> 02:05:47.210]  I enjoyed my days off in a way
[02:05:47.210 --> 02:05:50.330]  that went up to the age of 34 years old.
[02:05:50.330 --> 02:05:54.450]  And then I got a phone call on my way home from work,
[02:05:54.970 --> 02:05:58.370]  and my girlfriend at the time was like,
[02:05:58.370 --> 02:06:00.130]  I don't know what's wrong.
[02:06:00.130 --> 02:06:01.290]  I feel terribly sick.
[02:06:01.290 --> 02:06:02.890]  I need you to get home.
[02:06:02.890 --> 02:06:03.730]  I don't know what's up.
[02:06:03.730 --> 02:06:06.810]  I run home, I get home, I roll upstairs
[02:06:06.810 --> 02:06:08.170]  and walk into my bathroom,
[02:06:08.170 --> 02:06:10.610]  and she's on the floor holding a baby.
[02:06:10.610 --> 02:06:13.690]  Umbilical cord still run up in her.
[02:06:13.690 --> 02:06:15.570]  And we were at a wedding two days prior.
[02:06:15.570 --> 02:06:17.410]  She's like 110 pounds.
[02:06:17.410 --> 02:06:21.170]  You'd have no idea this baby was maybe three pounds,
[02:06:21.170 --> 02:06:22.610]  2.5 kilo.
[02:06:22.650 --> 02:06:25.530]  It's like one in a hundred thousand bursts.
[02:06:26.410 --> 02:06:28.010]  It's like this super rare thing,
[02:06:28.010 --> 02:06:30.850]  and that's how I got thrown into being a dad.
[02:06:30.850 --> 02:06:32.250]  And you guys were talking about-
[02:06:32.250 --> 02:06:34.050]  Oh, the baby survived.
[02:06:34.050 --> 02:06:34.890]  Yeah, dude.
[02:06:34.890 --> 02:06:37.450]  I'm like, she's five in school now, man.
[02:06:37.450 --> 02:06:38.610]  I married the woman.
[02:06:38.610 --> 02:06:39.610]  Like we have number two.
[02:06:39.610 --> 02:06:41.850]  She's covered in oatmeal next to me, but naked.
[02:06:41.850 --> 02:06:43.570]  So I can't show her on the screen.
[02:06:44.570 --> 02:06:47.450]  But yeah, man, it all turned out really, really good.
[02:06:47.450 --> 02:06:49.490]  But one thing that helped me, and you mentioned earlier,
[02:06:49.490 --> 02:06:51.170]  like you want a challenge in life?
[02:06:51.170 --> 02:06:52.010]  You want something?
[02:06:52.170 --> 02:06:55.010]  Think about a baby, like do an IMO pile.
[02:06:55.010 --> 02:06:56.050]  Have something that makes you,
[02:06:56.050 --> 02:06:58.330]  if you are having challenges in life,
[02:06:58.330 --> 02:07:01.050]  like after that situation happened,
[02:07:01.050 --> 02:07:02.450]  there's a lot of blaming.
[02:07:02.450 --> 02:07:04.770]  There's a lot of challenges after that.
[02:07:04.770 --> 02:07:06.770]  It's a pretty hard situation.
[02:07:06.770 --> 02:07:08.290]  The baby just came out of fucking nowhere.
[02:07:08.290 --> 02:07:10.010]  No one knows what the fuck happened.
[02:07:10.010 --> 02:07:10.850]  She doesn't know.
[02:07:10.850 --> 02:07:12.410]  We're all blaming each other.
[02:07:12.410 --> 02:07:13.290]  So it was rough.
[02:07:13.290 --> 02:07:14.930]  And I remember I got a little-
[02:07:14.930 --> 02:07:17.330]  Well, y'all two had something to do with it.
[02:07:17.330 --> 02:07:20.170]  Well, I still don't know where they come from.
[02:07:20.170 --> 02:07:21.050]  They keep popping up.
[02:07:21.090 --> 02:07:22.450]  I don't fucking get that.
[02:07:23.490 --> 02:07:27.850]  But yeah, so I was down, man.
[02:07:27.850 --> 02:07:28.690]  I was rough.
[02:07:28.690 --> 02:07:29.930]  We were separated for a bit.
[02:07:29.930 --> 02:07:31.410]  We were trying to figure out what's going on.
[02:07:31.410 --> 02:07:32.730]  We have no idea.
[02:07:32.730 --> 02:07:34.730]  And I had some time away from work,
[02:07:34.730 --> 02:07:35.890]  because I had to leave the industry,
[02:07:35.890 --> 02:07:37.530]  because there's no way it would work.
[02:07:37.530 --> 02:07:38.650]  I was working 16-hour days,
[02:07:38.650 --> 02:07:41.690]  six to seven days a week for years.
[02:07:41.690 --> 02:07:43.330]  So I needed to adapt and change
[02:07:43.330 --> 02:07:44.530]  so that I could see my family.
[02:07:44.530 --> 02:07:47.250]  And then I planted my first plant.
[02:07:47.250 --> 02:07:50.170]  And then that care for that change, that development,
[02:07:50.170 --> 02:07:52.210]  that growth, seeing that happen in front of me,
[02:07:52.210 --> 02:07:54.450]  that nurturing, and it was faster.
[02:07:54.450 --> 02:07:56.410]  It was much faster than growing a child.
[02:07:56.410 --> 02:07:58.290]  Trust me, they grow very slowly.
[02:07:58.290 --> 02:07:59.410]  It's a pain in the ass.
[02:07:59.410 --> 02:08:01.170]  20 years is a fucking long time.
[02:08:02.490 --> 02:08:06.610]  But the point of matter is it got me
[02:08:06.610 --> 02:08:08.090]  through one of those darkest points,
[02:08:08.090 --> 02:08:08.930]  one of those challenges,
[02:08:08.930 --> 02:08:10.890]  where I didn't know whether or not looking forward,
[02:08:10.890 --> 02:08:12.650]  I could care for something and take care of it
[02:08:12.650 --> 02:08:14.890]  and grow and develop it into something.
[02:08:14.890 --> 02:08:18.330]  And now I have two wonderful kids and a beautiful family
[02:08:18.330 --> 02:08:19.290]  and all this awesome stuff.
[02:08:19.330 --> 02:08:20.890]  So it's like these little things,
[02:08:20.890 --> 02:08:23.330]  it's planting these seeds, starting these IMOs,
[02:08:23.330 --> 02:08:25.450]  they can heal the world.
[02:08:25.450 --> 02:08:26.290]  They really can.
[02:08:29.050 --> 02:08:31.730]  I think natural farming, if that's what you're into,
[02:08:31.730 --> 02:08:33.650]  could be the thing, the hobby,
[02:08:33.650 --> 02:08:35.970]  that at least now you wanna get up out of bed
[02:08:35.970 --> 02:08:38.010]  earlier than you did the day before.
[02:08:38.010 --> 02:08:39.770]  And again, if you can just kind of focus
[02:08:39.770 --> 02:08:41.930]  on little wins at first,
[02:08:41.930 --> 02:08:43.530]  eventually you wanna do the big wins.
[02:08:43.530 --> 02:08:45.250]  You wanna wake up at 6 a.m.
[02:08:45.970 --> 02:08:50.410]  That is a snowball that is a beautiful thing in life,
[02:08:50.410 --> 02:08:52.530]  where if you just start to change those habits,
[02:08:52.530 --> 02:08:54.090]  it seems like your body, your mind,
[02:08:54.090 --> 02:08:55.890]  everybody like, well, you did it yesterday,
[02:08:55.890 --> 02:08:57.610]  just fucking get up and do it today.
[02:08:57.610 --> 02:09:01.130]  And then as those become habits,
[02:09:01.130 --> 02:09:02.930]  I think before you realize it,
[02:09:02.930 --> 02:09:04.050]  you kind of change your life
[02:09:04.050 --> 02:09:05.650]  without even really knowing that
[02:09:05.650 --> 02:09:08.970]  and finding happiness and maybe the little things
[02:09:08.970 --> 02:09:11.970]  is all you gotta really do is focus day to day.
[02:09:12.010 --> 02:09:17.010]  And then go back to like your goals and dreams in life,
[02:09:17.690 --> 02:09:18.970]  because you'll definitely realize
[02:09:18.970 --> 02:09:21.490]  that you can achieve something in life.
[02:09:21.490 --> 02:09:23.610]  I think everybody out there, I mean, realize,
[02:09:23.610 --> 02:09:24.730]  when I was younger,
[02:09:24.730 --> 02:09:27.170]  I thought we were gonna play football and soccer.
[02:09:27.170 --> 02:09:29.930]  I mean, you have the young athletic,
[02:09:29.930 --> 02:09:32.890]  but most of us realize when we get to a certain point
[02:09:32.890 --> 02:09:35.810]  that we don't have the athletic ability.
[02:09:35.810 --> 02:09:38.210]  And some people still to this day,
[02:09:38.210 --> 02:09:41.050]  I think still live in that little bubble, man,
[02:09:41.090 --> 02:09:42.650]  I've heard from dudes that were in my high school
[02:09:42.650 --> 02:09:44.690]  that kind of talk about that almost like,
[02:09:45.690 --> 02:09:47.250]  what was that movie?
[02:09:47.250 --> 02:09:48.530]  Fuck.
[02:09:48.530 --> 02:09:49.650]  There was this dude that used to,
[02:09:49.650 --> 02:09:51.250]  in a movie that used to talk about
[02:09:51.250 --> 02:09:52.890]  throwing a football quarter mile,
[02:09:52.890 --> 02:09:54.850]  used to be able to throw that football quarter mile
[02:09:54.850 --> 02:09:56.730]  over the mountains.
[02:09:56.730 --> 02:09:59.050]  And I think some people still are in that mindset
[02:09:59.050 --> 02:09:59.930]  where you gotta pivot,
[02:09:59.930 --> 02:10:02.330]  you gotta realize maybe I can't make money doing this,
[02:10:02.330 --> 02:10:03.930]  especially if you're an entrepreneur,
[02:10:03.930 --> 02:10:07.730]  your first couple of ideas might not even make sense.
[02:10:07.730 --> 02:10:10.010]  But I think having a hobby or something like that
[02:10:10.010 --> 02:10:12.490]  gives you something to think about and do
[02:10:12.490 --> 02:10:15.610]  than just sitting around and focusing on your thoughts
[02:10:15.610 --> 02:10:17.130]  when they're negative like that.
[02:10:17.130 --> 02:10:19.810]  And I think most people,
[02:10:19.810 --> 02:10:20.970]  if they were honest with themselves,
[02:10:20.970 --> 02:10:23.610]  have had some kind of feeling like that
[02:10:23.610 --> 02:10:24.970]  at some point in life.
[02:10:25.970 --> 02:10:29.570]  But the beauty of life is that you continue moving forward
[02:10:29.570 --> 02:10:32.930]  and then you realize that the sweet stuff is there as well.
[02:10:32.930 --> 02:10:34.690]  Like when you're tasting bitter,
[02:10:34.690 --> 02:10:36.250]  the sweets come in just as much.
[02:10:36.250 --> 02:10:37.090]  And when the sweet's there,
[02:10:37.090 --> 02:10:38.370]  just remember that every now and then
[02:10:38.370 --> 02:10:40.050]  a little bitters coming your way
[02:10:40.050 --> 02:10:42.530]  just to keep that shit balanced out.
[02:10:42.530 --> 02:10:43.890]  But when you are depressed and low,
[02:10:43.890 --> 02:10:45.770]  you forget about the sweet,
[02:10:45.770 --> 02:10:48.330]  but the sweet is the joy in life.
[02:10:50.170 --> 02:10:51.770]  Hell yeah.
[02:10:51.770 --> 02:10:52.810]  Shit, man.
[02:10:52.810 --> 02:10:55.090]  This was a great conversation, man.
[02:10:55.090 --> 02:10:57.650]  Hopefully this helps folks.
[02:10:57.650 --> 02:10:59.170]  We talk about everything on here.
[02:10:59.170 --> 02:11:01.290]  You never know what we might talk about.
[02:11:01.290 --> 02:11:03.610]  And I think that's the cool thing about it.
[02:11:03.610 --> 02:11:05.210]  You know what I mean?
[02:11:05.210 --> 02:11:07.690]  But mostly it's, you know, we're self-help,
[02:11:08.010 --> 02:11:10.570]  trying to keep everybody on the same page,
[02:11:10.570 --> 02:11:12.570]  myself included.
[02:11:12.570 --> 02:11:14.690]  Part of teaching is also learning.
[02:11:14.690 --> 02:11:16.810]  When you learn something and you teach it,
[02:11:16.810 --> 02:11:19.690]  you're kind of learning it again yourself,
[02:11:19.690 --> 02:11:20.530]  getting better at it.
[02:11:20.530 --> 02:11:23.290]  So, you know, that's why we always say
[02:11:23.290 --> 02:11:26.770]  these learning these natural farming techniques are good.
[02:11:26.770 --> 02:11:29.890]  And then when you learn them, you know, share what you know.
[02:11:35.570 --> 02:11:40.050]  I guess one of my last KNF tips since we're, it ties in.
[02:11:40.730 --> 02:11:42.010]  If any of this last bit of conversation
[02:11:42.010 --> 02:11:44.010]  resonated with you at all,
[02:11:44.010 --> 02:11:45.650]  you're interested in, you know,
[02:11:45.650 --> 02:11:47.250]  getting into Korean natural farming,
[02:11:47.250 --> 02:11:49.930]  even if you're already doing it and you have experience.
[02:11:49.930 --> 02:11:54.330]  I mentioned it earlier in the show, start your OHN.
[02:11:54.330 --> 02:11:55.170]  Okay?
[02:11:56.010 --> 02:11:57.290]  And here's why.
[02:11:57.290 --> 02:12:00.250]  OHN is a two and a half month process
[02:12:00.250 --> 02:12:02.810]  that requires your attention every single day.
[02:12:02.810 --> 02:12:03.650]  Okay?
[02:12:03.650 --> 02:12:06.250]  This is something that you can look forward to.
[02:12:06.250 --> 02:12:07.890]  You know, you have a routine.
[02:12:07.890 --> 02:12:09.250]  You've something to look forward to every day.
[02:12:09.290 --> 02:12:10.850]  And part of the process is, you know,
[02:12:10.850 --> 02:12:13.170]  physically stirring every single jar
[02:12:13.170 --> 02:12:14.890]  while thinking good thoughts.
[02:12:14.890 --> 02:12:18.890]  That is literally in the instructions, right?
[02:12:18.890 --> 02:12:22.210]  OHN is farming you as much as you are, you know,
[02:12:22.210 --> 02:12:24.290]  farming it essentially, right?
[02:12:24.290 --> 02:12:27.410]  That is why those kinds of things are part of that process,
[02:12:27.410 --> 02:12:29.930]  in my opinion, from my perspective.
[02:12:29.930 --> 02:12:31.410]  You know, it is a therapy.
[02:12:31.410 --> 02:12:33.090]  A lot of this stuff is therapy for me.
[02:12:33.090 --> 02:12:34.690]  That just that simple thing every day,
[02:12:34.690 --> 02:12:38.650]  smelling that OHN, every herb that you open,
[02:12:39.410 --> 02:12:42.210]  it's aroma therapy in a sense, you know,
[02:12:42.210 --> 02:12:44.650]  and just the hands-on aspect of it,
[02:12:44.650 --> 02:12:47.410]  intentionally trying to think good thoughts
[02:12:47.410 --> 02:12:48.490]  for this process.
[02:12:48.490 --> 02:12:53.250]  It like psychologically trains you to have that optimism
[02:12:53.250 --> 02:12:57.010]  and that higher level of vibration, right?
[02:12:57.010 --> 02:12:59.370]  So that's my suggestion.
[02:12:59.370 --> 02:13:00.730]  I would go ahead and get started on it
[02:13:00.730 --> 02:13:03.010]  and get like that part of your life
[02:13:03.010 --> 02:13:05.770]  for the next two and a half months, get through winter.
[02:13:06.770 --> 02:13:10.290]  Man, you got me craving a sip of OHN now.
[02:13:10.290 --> 02:13:11.610]  I didn't bring any with me.
[02:13:11.610 --> 02:13:13.170]  I mean, it's a wonderful thing.
[02:13:13.170 --> 02:13:15.730]  I just got chills through my body
[02:13:15.730 --> 02:13:17.410]  just thinking about having a sip of it.
[02:13:17.410 --> 02:13:19.450]  But yeah, man, it is very good.
[02:13:20.410 --> 02:13:22.570]  You guys are giving me the itch so bad
[02:13:22.570 --> 02:13:24.330]  because I've been, I've got like,
[02:13:24.330 --> 02:13:26.930]  I have a very little yard in the backyard
[02:13:26.930 --> 02:13:30.490]  and I have not had the ability to play properly yet.
[02:13:30.490 --> 02:13:34.410]  And March 1st, it looks like we're going to be flying,
[02:13:34.410 --> 02:13:36.450]  taking our first trip flight to Italy
[02:13:38.170 --> 02:13:40.970]  and stepping onto the farm for the first time.
[02:13:43.170 --> 02:13:45.650]  Hold on, the farm, you got, you're moving to Italy?
[02:13:45.650 --> 02:13:46.490]  You got some-
[02:13:46.490 --> 02:13:48.930]  I got an acre of farmland in Puglia,
[02:13:48.930 --> 02:13:50.650]  the Southern part of Italy.
[02:13:50.650 --> 02:13:53.010]  So it's like, it's a little bit, need some work.
[02:13:53.010 --> 02:13:55.010]  It's been a farm for a while,
[02:13:55.010 --> 02:13:56.610]  but I'm going to go regenerative.
[02:13:56.610 --> 02:13:59.010]  I'm going to olives and oranges
[02:13:59.010 --> 02:14:00.970]  and do the whole nine yards and things.
[02:14:00.970 --> 02:14:03.610]  So I'm excited because I've gotten the opportunity
[02:14:03.770 --> 02:14:05.690]  to work with amazing folks like yourself
[02:14:05.690 --> 02:14:09.930]  on such a regular basis that I get to go like practice
[02:14:09.930 --> 02:14:11.650]  and experiment and do some of this.
[02:14:11.650 --> 02:14:15.250]  Right now, I live in a house that we share with our parents
[02:14:15.250 --> 02:14:17.370]  that live on the upstairs and it's very full
[02:14:17.370 --> 02:14:19.770]  and very busy and not a lot of yard.
[02:14:19.770 --> 02:14:23.050]  So I've got an acre of one full square acre of land,
[02:14:23.050 --> 02:14:24.930]  just straight play.
[02:14:24.930 --> 02:14:27.250]  So I'm very excited to do that.
[02:14:27.250 --> 02:14:29.210]  And I was going to take some time and work and effort,
[02:14:29.210 --> 02:14:30.050]  but it'll be-
[02:14:30.050 --> 02:14:31.250]  That's the fun part.
[02:14:32.650 --> 02:14:33.490]  Exactly.
[02:14:34.330 --> 02:14:35.210]  That's the life, that's the living.
[02:14:35.210 --> 02:14:37.810]  Well, you know, my wife would love to go to Italy.
[02:14:37.810 --> 02:14:39.930]  So you're there, man.
[02:14:39.930 --> 02:14:42.330]  We'll fly over and I'll help you out.
[02:14:43.410 --> 02:14:44.650]  Anytime, man.
[02:14:44.650 --> 02:14:46.170]  You can come set up with us.
[02:14:46.170 --> 02:14:47.010]  No problem.
[02:14:47.010 --> 02:14:47.850]  Let me, I got to get,
[02:14:47.850 --> 02:14:48.970]  so we're going to be there for the first three months
[02:14:48.970 --> 02:14:49.810]  in March.
[02:14:49.810 --> 02:14:51.410]  So maybe not the first stint out.
[02:14:51.410 --> 02:14:52.250]  Yeah, not the first.
[02:14:52.250 --> 02:14:54.450]  We got to go check on some things,
[02:14:54.450 --> 02:14:55.970]  but the second time for sure.
[02:14:55.970 --> 02:14:57.970]  I'm hoping to be in Spanibus in May.
[02:14:57.970 --> 02:14:59.970]  I've been reaching out to them to try and get some tickets
[02:14:59.970 --> 02:15:01.330]  and see if they can provide some stuff
[02:15:01.330 --> 02:15:02.810]  so we could be live on location.
[02:15:03.090 --> 02:15:05.610]  So also if anybody knows anybody at Spanibus.
[02:15:05.610 --> 02:15:06.930]  That's pretty cool.
[02:15:06.930 --> 02:15:08.570]  I had a good time in Spain, man.
[02:15:08.570 --> 02:15:10.930]  They got a, the way they, you smoke over there,
[02:15:10.930 --> 02:15:13.050]  you have to join a club while you're there.
[02:15:13.050 --> 02:15:14.450]  You join a little social club.
[02:15:14.450 --> 02:15:15.450]  So Spain's cool.
[02:15:15.450 --> 02:15:16.290]  I love it.
[02:15:16.290 --> 02:15:17.330]  But they're, you know, they're cannabis.
[02:15:17.330 --> 02:15:20.770]  They were young, you know, they appreciate you though.
[02:15:20.770 --> 02:15:23.130]  But they were new to the game.
[02:15:23.130 --> 02:15:27.690]  Young, little young on their cannabis.
[02:15:27.690 --> 02:15:29.170]  But that's what it's all about, man.
[02:15:29.210 --> 02:15:32.810]  When people come open up and get a chance to grow,
[02:15:32.810 --> 02:15:34.450]  they growing and they get better.
[02:15:34.450 --> 02:15:36.010]  You know what I mean?
[02:15:36.010 --> 02:15:38.850]  I remember, man, leaving that joint in Spain.
[02:15:38.850 --> 02:15:40.810]  And you guys ever watched like,
[02:15:42.010 --> 02:15:44.850]  like Locked Up Abroad, that show.
[02:15:44.850 --> 02:15:46.810]  Dude, I went to this Spain.
[02:15:46.810 --> 02:15:49.450]  We were in the club deal.
[02:15:49.450 --> 02:15:51.410]  And you know, they had that heady shit.
[02:15:51.410 --> 02:15:53.890]  You know, it was like that harvested early, real heady.
[02:15:53.890 --> 02:15:56.850]  And left out of there, man, paranoid as hell,
[02:15:56.850 --> 02:15:57.730]  you know, in Europe.
[02:15:57.730 --> 02:16:01.690]  And I'm in this like convenience store, right?
[02:16:01.690 --> 02:16:04.690]  Dude, to this day, I'm in this convenience store,
[02:16:04.690 --> 02:16:09.330]  me and Nicky, and it was two other guys in there with suits.
[02:16:09.330 --> 02:16:12.090]  And everywhere I went, it was a small local,
[02:16:12.090 --> 02:16:14.330]  and everywhere I went, it was like the dude would like,
[02:16:14.330 --> 02:16:16.450]  if I go to the drink corner, he like waits on me.
[02:16:16.450 --> 02:16:18.050]  And like, I'm like, dude, do you want a drink?
[02:16:18.050 --> 02:16:19.050]  He's like, no, go ahead.
[02:16:19.050 --> 02:16:21.370]  So I get my drink.
[02:16:21.370 --> 02:16:24.730]  But by the time I got to the counter, I was so paranoid.
[02:16:24.730 --> 02:16:26.730]  I started pulling out my money and shit
[02:16:26.730 --> 02:16:27.890]  and handing it to Nicky.
[02:16:27.890 --> 02:16:30.330]  Like, I'm like, they're about to arrest me.
[02:16:30.330 --> 02:16:32.250]  So I just pay for my shit and leave.
[02:16:32.250 --> 02:16:34.490]  But I was like, it was so crazy, dude.
[02:16:34.490 --> 02:16:36.890]  I've never been that paranoid before in my life.
[02:16:36.890 --> 02:16:38.690]  I swore I was going to get locked up.
[02:16:38.690 --> 02:16:40.250]  They didn't, they weren't about me.
[02:16:40.250 --> 02:16:41.530]  They didn't give a fuck about me.
[02:16:41.530 --> 02:16:44.490]  But for some reason, man, I just felt like they were just
[02:16:44.490 --> 02:16:47.370]  sweating me, and I was about to spend the rest of my vacation
[02:16:47.370 --> 02:16:51.130]  in jail over that money.
[02:16:51.130 --> 02:16:52.690]  Hey, maybe they were sweating you,
[02:16:52.690 --> 02:16:55.810]  like when the cop pulls up and follows you for a few miles,
[02:16:55.810 --> 02:16:58.730]  and then you just drive off and they get off at an exit.
[02:16:58.730 --> 02:16:59.770]  It might have been.
[02:16:59.770 --> 02:17:01.570]  Like, why you got to do that, man?
[02:17:01.570 --> 02:17:03.170]  My heart's pounding over here.
[02:17:03.170 --> 02:17:04.570]  Exactly.
[02:17:04.570 --> 02:17:08.290]  You know, I bet you that cop is riding behind you,
[02:17:08.290 --> 02:17:10.530]  and this guy, and just like, this guy's fucking going
[02:17:10.530 --> 02:17:12.370]  exactly the fucking speed limit.
[02:17:12.370 --> 02:17:13.250]  Can he pick it up?
[02:17:13.250 --> 02:17:14.730]  I can't get the fuck around him.
[02:17:14.730 --> 02:17:15.930]  It's so slow.
[02:17:15.930 --> 02:17:17.290]  I'm going to have to pull you over
[02:17:17.290 --> 02:17:20.730]  if you don't speed up, dude.
[02:17:20.730 --> 02:17:24.090]  Yeah, man, being paranoid, I remember being super high,
[02:17:24.090 --> 02:17:25.330]  you know, roof racks.
[02:17:25.690 --> 02:17:28.850]  All the classic things, your heart start pounding,
[02:17:28.850 --> 02:17:31.010]  light turn green, it'd be a little more light to it,
[02:17:31.010 --> 02:17:32.570]  and they'd, oh, thank God.
[02:17:32.570 --> 02:17:33.930]  All right, you know?
[02:17:33.930 --> 02:17:36.490]  I mean, all those things are kind of silly,
[02:17:36.490 --> 02:17:40.290]  but as things progressed, it's nice now just to be able
[02:17:40.290 --> 02:17:44.130]  to, for most of us, smoke in our house and chill.
[02:17:44.130 --> 02:17:45.370]  Comfort, too.
[02:17:46.530 --> 02:17:49.130]  Sheldon, what's the future for you, buddy?
[02:17:49.130 --> 02:17:52.530]  I mean, Texas is going to be where you're at for forever.
[02:17:52.530 --> 02:17:54.930]  Are you, you and the missus talk about,
[02:17:55.530 --> 02:17:57.290]  hey, when you start taking off,
[02:17:57.290 --> 02:17:58.850]  we're going to have some kids of our own.
[02:17:58.850 --> 02:18:01.930]  Like, what's your life focus on, man?
[02:18:03.170 --> 02:18:04.330]  That's a good question, brother.
[02:18:04.330 --> 02:18:09.330]  So the way our life has been for the last seven years or so
[02:18:10.730 --> 02:18:13.370]  has been we could get a call any day and say,
[02:18:13.370 --> 02:18:17.010]  hey, you are moving here, and you have two weeks.
[02:18:17.010 --> 02:18:21.090]  So that's happened five times in the last seven years.
[02:18:21.130 --> 02:18:25.970]  And we just moved here from North Carolina back in February.
[02:18:25.970 --> 02:18:28.290]  So we haven't even been here a full year yet.
[02:18:28.290 --> 02:18:33.170]  And the situation there is North Carolina, I had acreage.
[02:18:33.170 --> 02:18:34.570]  We had a nice house.
[02:18:34.570 --> 02:18:36.250]  I had a big shop and everything I was doing
[02:18:36.250 --> 02:18:38.610]  on my natural farming and indoor grow and stuff.
[02:18:40.530 --> 02:18:44.410]  So when we moved here, cost of living is significantly more.
[02:18:44.410 --> 02:18:46.810]  Land prices are significantly different.
[02:18:46.810 --> 02:18:50.810]  So we actually spent almost $100,000 more on a home.
[02:18:51.530 --> 02:18:52.850]  I have a 10th of an acre.
[02:18:52.850 --> 02:18:54.690]  Our house is like half the size
[02:18:54.690 --> 02:18:55.930]  and in the middle of the suburbs.
[02:18:55.930 --> 02:18:58.490]  My neighbors are six foot apart on either side of me.
[02:18:58.490 --> 02:19:00.210]  So I took the year off farming.
[02:19:00.210 --> 02:19:02.290]  That is why, again, I've been able to dedicate
[02:19:02.290 --> 02:19:04.730]  a lot of this time into the educational aspect
[02:19:04.730 --> 02:19:07.690]  and building a platform online and the Discord
[02:19:07.690 --> 02:19:10.170]  and all that stuff to educate, educate, educate.
[02:19:10.170 --> 02:19:14.890]  So my goal is to eventually land somewhere with a farm,
[02:19:16.010 --> 02:19:18.770]  have a facility that is like my natural farming lab,
[02:19:18.770 --> 02:19:20.450]  make all the inputs and everything,
[02:19:21.090 --> 02:19:24.010]  and have that also double as a learning facility
[02:19:24.010 --> 02:19:26.570]  so that I'm not traveling all over the United States
[02:19:26.570 --> 02:19:28.330]  while I'm trying to farm and everything here
[02:19:28.330 --> 02:19:30.290]  and raise my family in Homestead.
[02:19:30.290 --> 02:19:32.610]  Like you guys, you can come here and visit me
[02:19:32.610 --> 02:19:36.570]  and see it in action, like a living representation of this
[02:19:36.570 --> 02:19:40.050]  and stay here for a week and learn the system yourself.
[02:19:40.050 --> 02:19:41.330]  That's my goal.
[02:19:41.330 --> 02:19:42.730]  I wanna have somewhere we can land.
[02:19:42.730 --> 02:19:44.970]  I can, like you said, kind of raise a family,
[02:19:44.970 --> 02:19:46.970]  fully Homestead, incorporate the livestock
[02:19:46.970 --> 02:19:48.450]  and all the knowledge that I've gained
[02:19:48.450 --> 02:19:50.250]  and been able to apply in other situations
[02:19:51.050 --> 02:19:52.850]  little by little here and there with other people,
[02:19:52.850 --> 02:19:54.490]  do it for myself.
[02:19:54.490 --> 02:19:55.770]  And that's kind of been our agreement.
[02:19:55.770 --> 02:19:57.170]  We flip-flopped over the years,
[02:19:57.170 --> 02:19:59.050]  who's like kind of supporting who.
[02:19:59.050 --> 02:20:01.130]  Very beginning, she was still in college.
[02:20:01.130 --> 02:20:03.250]  I was just working full-time job, paying our bills
[02:20:03.250 --> 02:20:04.690]  so she could get through school.
[02:20:04.690 --> 02:20:07.730]  Then she lands the big time job, right, and it flips back.
[02:20:07.730 --> 02:20:10.610]  So now it's like, I'm trying to get this rolling
[02:20:10.610 --> 02:20:11.970]  so that we can get to that point
[02:20:11.970 --> 02:20:14.010]  where she's not having to work her ass off
[02:20:14.010 --> 02:20:16.930]  60, 80 hours a week, traveling over the United States
[02:20:16.930 --> 02:20:19.410]  every single week, just busting ass
[02:20:19.410 --> 02:20:22.090]  so we can pay bills.
[02:20:22.090 --> 02:20:22.970]  That sucks.
[02:20:22.970 --> 02:20:24.850]  We wanna live life together.
[02:20:24.850 --> 02:20:26.210]  So that's where we're at.
[02:20:26.210 --> 02:20:27.770]  I am trying to get the ball rolling here,
[02:20:27.770 --> 02:20:29.130]  make enough money, hopefully,
[02:20:29.130 --> 02:20:31.530]  so that can buy a piece of land somewhere,
[02:20:31.530 --> 02:20:32.730]  even if it's an acre or two.
[02:20:32.730 --> 02:20:34.650]  Oklahoma, it's where we're looking.
[02:20:34.650 --> 02:20:38.010]  Arkansas even, because we can't afford it here.
[02:20:38.010 --> 02:20:42.170]  One acre here with no anything on it at all,
[02:20:42.170 --> 02:20:45.650]  80 to 100 grand, it's not feasible.
[02:20:47.290 --> 02:20:48.730]  That's my life currently.
[02:20:50.410 --> 02:20:53.530]  Well, Aaron, part of that is having her
[02:20:53.530 --> 02:20:55.290]  as your support system
[02:20:55.290 --> 02:20:58.170]  so that when things are a little bit tougher or rougher,
[02:20:58.170 --> 02:21:00.130]  like you guys got each other,
[02:21:00.130 --> 02:21:02.210]  you can bounce ideas off each other.
[02:21:02.210 --> 02:21:04.810]  I don't know if enough people do that
[02:21:04.810 --> 02:21:06.810]  around the kitchen table anymore.
[02:21:06.810 --> 02:21:08.410]  It's kind of like you just zone out
[02:21:08.410 --> 02:21:10.050]  when in reality you could be sitting there
[02:21:10.050 --> 02:21:12.890]  just finding better ways to take hold.
[02:21:12.890 --> 02:21:16.970]  And I felt like I got that drilled into me,
[02:21:16.970 --> 02:21:19.530]  third eye style during COVID,
[02:21:19.530 --> 02:21:20.890]  where everything shut down.
[02:21:20.890 --> 02:21:22.970]  It was like, man, I mean,
[02:21:22.970 --> 02:21:27.210]  life can change pretty drastically when before,
[02:21:27.210 --> 02:21:30.450]  I mean, I would think most of us before COVID,
[02:21:30.450 --> 02:21:31.930]  did you guys honestly believe
[02:21:31.930 --> 02:21:33.970]  that the world would shut down like that?
[02:21:36.130 --> 02:21:36.970]  Even when they were talking.
[02:21:36.970 --> 02:21:37.810]  I mean, you kind of had feelings,
[02:21:37.810 --> 02:21:38.970]  but you didn't let's see it.
[02:21:40.090 --> 02:21:43.250]  In the eerie, I remember they were building hospitals
[02:21:43.250 --> 02:21:45.930]  and stuff in China in like just a few days.
[02:21:46.450 --> 02:21:48.570]  It was kind of blew my mind
[02:21:48.570 --> 02:21:53.010]  on what potentially could happen to mankind
[02:21:53.010 --> 02:21:56.490]  just from us not paying attention and getting viruses
[02:21:56.490 --> 02:21:59.970]  and all the variables.
[02:22:01.010 --> 02:22:03.490]  I mean, a lot of that was, I mean, yeah, I get it.
[02:22:03.490 --> 02:22:06.490]  Yeah, but a lot of that shit was unnecessary.
[02:22:06.490 --> 02:22:08.090]  I didn't wear no fucking mask.
[02:22:08.090 --> 02:22:10.650]  I went everywhere I wanted to fucking go
[02:22:10.650 --> 02:22:12.170]  and didn't wear that shit.
[02:22:12.170 --> 02:22:13.130]  Fuck that.
[02:22:13.130 --> 02:22:15.570]  That's what I wanted to get to is if you understand that
[02:22:16.210 --> 02:22:17.450]  when you're building your soil microbes,
[02:22:17.450 --> 02:22:19.530]  you got to remember that the immune system
[02:22:19.530 --> 02:22:22.610]  is one hell of a defense.
[02:22:22.610 --> 02:22:23.930]  And that's tried and true.
[02:22:23.930 --> 02:22:26.330]  Talk about something that's tried and true
[02:22:26.330 --> 02:22:28.050]  for a variety of things.
[02:22:28.050 --> 02:22:31.690]  And I don't know, man, I just think moving forward,
[02:22:34.490 --> 02:22:37.050]  the hysteria, maybe the fear of some of that stuff
[02:22:37.050 --> 02:22:38.850]  has gone away.
[02:22:38.850 --> 02:22:41.050]  And I would love to see more live events
[02:22:41.050 --> 02:22:42.650]  and some of the stuff we've been talking about
[02:22:42.650 --> 02:22:43.490]  these last few weeks
[02:22:43.490 --> 02:22:45.770]  of where more people can kind of get together.
[02:22:46.770 --> 02:22:48.130]  Cause that's where the real magic happens
[02:22:48.130 --> 02:22:50.730]  for the natural farming world, for organic farmers,
[02:22:50.730 --> 02:22:52.770]  for people newer to it.
[02:22:52.770 --> 02:22:54.490]  It did seem like the live events
[02:22:54.490 --> 02:22:56.570]  where people were just kind of talking.
[02:22:56.570 --> 02:22:58.010]  Marco, again, shout out to you, buddy.
[02:22:58.010 --> 02:22:59.450]  We tried one in Oklahoma.
[02:22:59.450 --> 02:23:01.290]  Sheldon, you were saying you lost money.
[02:23:01.290 --> 02:23:03.370]  Believe me, anytime I've thrown one of those events,
[02:23:03.370 --> 02:23:04.490]  you lose money.
[02:23:04.490 --> 02:23:06.250]  I think that's just how it is.
[02:23:07.410 --> 02:23:09.810]  But that's also part of maybe earning your stripes
[02:23:09.810 --> 02:23:11.930]  or however you wanna look at it.
[02:23:11.970 --> 02:23:13.730]  Yeah, it's an investment, man.
[02:23:13.730 --> 02:23:15.330]  I know when I went out to Oklahoma,
[02:23:15.330 --> 02:23:16.890]  I wasn't making no money.
[02:23:16.890 --> 02:23:19.210]  I paid for my shit and went on out there
[02:23:19.210 --> 02:23:20.890]  and we did that together, man.
[02:23:20.890 --> 02:23:23.050]  But it's like an investment.
[02:23:23.050 --> 02:23:24.210]  You gotta give, man.
[02:23:24.210 --> 02:23:26.210]  You gotta give a little bit to get a little bit.
[02:23:26.210 --> 02:23:27.050]  You know what I mean?
[02:23:27.050 --> 02:23:29.130]  And you can't just only have your hand out.
[02:23:29.130 --> 02:23:29.970]  You know what I mean?
[02:23:29.970 --> 02:23:32.450]  So if it means you gotta buy yourself a ticket sometime
[02:23:32.450 --> 02:23:35.410]  and get to where you gotta get to grow yourself,
[02:23:35.410 --> 02:23:36.250]  you know what I mean?
[02:23:36.250 --> 02:23:37.450]  And help other people grow,
[02:23:37.450 --> 02:23:39.090]  sometimes you just gotta do that.
[02:23:39.730 --> 02:23:43.490]  But don't do that more than,
[02:23:43.490 --> 02:23:45.970]  don't get yourself in a bind doing that.
[02:23:45.970 --> 02:23:47.770]  You can do too much.
[02:23:47.770 --> 02:23:48.610]  You know what I mean?
[02:23:48.610 --> 02:23:49.450]  Do what you can do.
[02:23:49.450 --> 02:23:50.290]  You know what I mean?
[02:23:50.290 --> 02:23:51.290]  If I couldn't afford to go out there,
[02:23:51.290 --> 02:23:53.010]  I would've said, Brian, I can't make it, bro.
[02:23:53.010 --> 02:23:53.850]  Can't do it.
[02:23:53.850 --> 02:23:57.810]  Like, I'm not gonna put myself in a bind to help.
[02:23:59.290 --> 02:24:01.050]  You don't wanna get yourself into a mess
[02:24:01.050 --> 02:24:03.090]  trying to help somebody else out of a mess,
[02:24:03.090 --> 02:24:04.570]  you know, if that makes any sense.
[02:24:04.570 --> 02:24:06.730]  Because then now you're both kinda screwed.
[02:24:07.570 --> 02:24:10.010]  What do you, London, you've been,
[02:24:10.010 --> 02:24:11.330]  I would say this year, man,
[02:24:11.330 --> 02:24:13.090]  you've been one of the forefront guys,
[02:24:13.090 --> 02:24:14.810]  at least in the digital aspects,
[02:24:14.810 --> 02:24:16.890]  putting up a lot of these events.
[02:24:16.890 --> 02:24:18.210]  And then behind the scenes,
[02:24:18.210 --> 02:24:20.090]  we don't really necessarily always understand
[02:24:20.090 --> 02:24:21.970]  the vibe of the audience.
[02:24:21.970 --> 02:24:23.290]  Like where you're at,
[02:24:23.290 --> 02:24:24.970]  does it seem like natural farming
[02:24:24.970 --> 02:24:27.570]  is starting to kinda get that same buzz that,
[02:24:27.570 --> 02:24:30.570]  you know, sadly, I wish it was bigger,
[02:24:30.570 --> 02:24:33.210]  but I think there's pockets of it here in America
[02:24:33.210 --> 02:24:36.010]  that are really starting to take off for just a little bit.
[02:24:36.570 --> 02:24:38.570]  For just food matters,
[02:24:38.570 --> 02:24:41.770]  where you get your cannabis matters,
[02:24:41.770 --> 02:24:44.530]  those kinda like viewpoints.
[02:24:44.530 --> 02:24:46.770]  I see for the regenerative farming side,
[02:24:46.770 --> 02:24:48.090]  I see the best of sex
[02:24:48.090 --> 02:24:50.170]  when things are paired with other events.
[02:24:54.850 --> 02:24:56.810]  So paired with other events.
[02:24:56.810 --> 02:24:58.730]  Yeah, paired with other events.
[02:24:58.730 --> 02:25:00.530]  Yeah, I see this little lady.
[02:25:00.530 --> 02:25:02.370]  Paired with, I'm getting given this,
[02:25:02.370 --> 02:25:04.410]  paired with other events like music festivals.
[02:25:04.410 --> 02:25:06.130]  So the Unicorn Cup does,
[02:25:06.130 --> 02:25:09.290]  has DM Pure, the Dragonfly Earth Medicine.
[02:25:09.290 --> 02:25:11.250]  They have a whole area that they do.
[02:25:11.250 --> 02:25:12.210]  And this next year,
[02:25:12.210 --> 02:25:14.210]  they're gonna do their own education.
[02:25:14.210 --> 02:25:15.970]  They're gonna do a whole big thing.
[02:25:15.970 --> 02:25:17.850]  And that's a regenerative space.
[02:25:17.850 --> 02:25:18.690]  And I find like, you know,
[02:25:18.690 --> 02:25:21.450]  once, maybe twice a year, regenerative farming.
[02:25:21.450 --> 02:25:22.690]  One of the things that we had is,
[02:25:22.690 --> 02:25:23.930]  you know, at the start of COVID,
[02:25:23.930 --> 02:25:25.490]  things got pretty interesting.
[02:25:25.490 --> 02:25:27.770]  What I saw was a lot of farmers pop off.
[02:25:28.970 --> 02:25:31.250]  And like you mentioned earlier,
[02:25:31.250 --> 02:25:34.770]  that had a lot of experience.
[02:25:34.770 --> 02:25:39.010]  And they were like charging five, $6,000 for a course
[02:25:39.010 --> 02:25:40.850]  that is given away for free
[02:25:40.850 --> 02:25:44.090]  by people far more educated than them.
[02:25:44.090 --> 02:25:45.570]  And it's just, so it's like,
[02:25:45.570 --> 02:25:48.290]  it was kind of a,
[02:25:48.290 --> 02:25:49.770]  it gave a few of the people
[02:25:49.770 --> 02:25:52.490]  that were part of the space here,
[02:25:52.490 --> 02:25:54.410]  either people that I think would have had
[02:25:54.410 --> 02:25:56.730]  a lot more success long-term in this space,
[02:25:57.650 --> 02:25:59.290]  a bad image.
[02:25:59.290 --> 02:26:01.130]  You know, they had challenges.
[02:26:02.010 --> 02:26:03.490]  Like I've seen people spray down entire,
[02:26:03.490 --> 02:26:04.730]  their entire gardening,
[02:26:04.730 --> 02:26:06.210]  like they're educating others
[02:26:06.210 --> 02:26:08.050]  and they burn their entire crop
[02:26:08.050 --> 02:26:12.130]  by making a too strong of a K&F solution.
[02:26:12.130 --> 02:26:13.370]  You know, like, it's like,
[02:26:13.370 --> 02:26:15.370]  dude, if you're burning your crops,
[02:26:15.370 --> 02:26:17.050]  you're not ready to educate others.
[02:26:17.050 --> 02:26:18.490]  If this is your second turn,
[02:26:18.490 --> 02:26:21.090]  you're not educated enough there yet.
[02:26:21.090 --> 02:26:21.930]  You know what I mean?
[02:26:21.930 --> 02:26:23.650]  I don't care if you're confident enough
[02:26:23.650 --> 02:26:25.690]  to drink your rotten vinegars.
[02:26:25.690 --> 02:26:27.250]  It doesn't matter to me.
[02:26:27.250 --> 02:26:29.930]  You need to have a little bit more education based on that.
[02:26:29.930 --> 02:26:30.970]  And especially if you're gonna charge
[02:26:31.810 --> 02:26:32.650]  for something more than that.
[02:26:32.650 --> 02:26:35.090]  But anyways, I digress because really what it comes down to
[02:26:35.090 --> 02:26:36.730]  is the events and what's happening.
[02:26:36.730 --> 02:26:39.290]  I see music festivals in line with it,
[02:26:39.290 --> 02:26:41.130]  cannabis and festivals in line with it
[02:26:41.130 --> 02:26:43.690]  are creating a lot of spread and movement,
[02:26:43.690 --> 02:26:45.610]  a lot more discussion, a lot more placement.
[02:26:45.610 --> 02:26:47.370]  People are like, even BC,
[02:26:47.370 --> 02:26:48.810]  I'm hearing people speak about
[02:26:48.810 --> 02:26:51.970]  regenerative agricultural methodology
[02:26:51.970 --> 02:26:55.010]  in the soil of the product that they're purchasing
[02:26:55.010 --> 02:26:58.530]  over just the basic living soil,
[02:26:58.530 --> 02:27:00.730]  which we're kind of skipping past like that.
[02:27:01.490 --> 02:27:02.530]  That slang terminology being thrown around.
[02:27:02.530 --> 02:27:04.410]  So I wanna see a lot more events happen
[02:27:05.330 --> 02:27:06.490]  and a lot more going on,
[02:27:06.490 --> 02:27:10.250]  but I don't think there's enough there
[02:27:10.250 --> 02:27:11.730]  to do them very regularly.
[02:27:11.730 --> 02:27:14.450]  Like I'd like to bring Jeff Lowensfeldt down for an event
[02:27:14.450 --> 02:27:16.410]  and do it down over here in the area,
[02:27:16.410 --> 02:27:18.250]  but there's also some amazing events
[02:27:18.250 --> 02:27:19.370]  that happen in Washington.
[02:27:19.370 --> 02:27:22.730]  And is it necessary to have one on both sides of the border?
[02:27:24.650 --> 02:27:25.490]  I don't know.
[02:27:26.410 --> 02:27:28.210]  I would like to see it happen,
[02:27:28.210 --> 02:27:32.050]  but I have yet to be at a completely
[02:27:32.050 --> 02:27:34.610]  regenerative agricultural event here in BC
[02:27:34.610 --> 02:27:37.410]  that is not either concentrated
[02:27:37.410 --> 02:27:39.970]  with a strong cannabis involvement
[02:27:39.970 --> 02:27:42.890]  or a music festival involvement
[02:27:42.890 --> 02:27:44.250]  at this point in time anyways,
[02:27:44.250 --> 02:27:46.730]  or sometimes they're psychedelic connected too.
[02:27:46.730 --> 02:27:51.410]  Like we had the spirit thing recently
[02:27:51.410 --> 02:27:54.450]  that was pretty epic that DM was at.
[02:27:55.290 --> 02:27:58.410]  Was that the one that was on top of the roof
[02:27:58.410 --> 02:28:00.970]  where you could kind of see the water and all that?
[02:28:02.050 --> 02:28:04.370]  I don't remember.
[02:28:04.370 --> 02:28:05.330]  Oh, the rooftop one.
[02:28:05.330 --> 02:28:08.050]  No, that was out in, actually, yeah,
[02:28:08.050 --> 02:28:09.690]  that one had a few different things.
[02:28:09.690 --> 02:28:12.730]  So that was in the BC Craft Co-op
[02:28:12.730 --> 02:28:16.730]  does a yearly event, a summit in-
[02:28:16.730 --> 02:28:18.810]  We should fly to that, Marco.
[02:28:18.810 --> 02:28:20.650]  That one looked like it was done.
[02:28:22.370 --> 02:28:24.410]  Yeah, explain it for him.
[02:28:25.370 --> 02:28:27.770]  So essentially, that's it's legal here.
[02:28:27.770 --> 02:28:29.610]  You know how you have like farmer co-ops,
[02:28:29.610 --> 02:28:31.170]  like the dairy farmer co-op
[02:28:31.170 --> 02:28:32.850]  and then the grain farmer co-op?
[02:28:32.850 --> 02:28:35.370]  We have a cannabis farmers co-op.
[02:28:35.370 --> 02:28:37.050]  So every year the BC event,
[02:28:37.050 --> 02:28:41.570]  cannabis farmers co-op throws a yearly summit
[02:28:42.410 --> 02:28:43.970]  and they invite a bunch of farmers down.
[02:28:43.970 --> 02:28:46.690]  So we were there with Marcus Bubbleman,
[02:28:47.730 --> 02:28:51.450]  DM here, Josh and Kelly, some of the local people.
[02:28:51.450 --> 02:28:53.930]  There was some good talk about regenerative agriculture
[02:28:54.450 --> 02:28:55.370]  in that space as well.
[02:28:55.370 --> 02:28:59.130]  That was a very fun one, a little bit more upscale,
[02:28:59.130 --> 02:29:02.490]  but definitely it was a cool event.
[02:29:02.490 --> 02:29:04.410]  The fact that these events are changing a little bit,
[02:29:04.410 --> 02:29:07.770]  I think is good because it's putting
[02:29:07.770 --> 02:29:11.890]  regenerative conversation into the mouths of people
[02:29:11.890 --> 02:29:14.810]  that are going and giving them some education
[02:29:14.810 --> 02:29:16.010]  and understanding on it.
[02:29:16.010 --> 02:29:18.490]  I think it's happening a little bit slower,
[02:29:18.490 --> 02:29:22.730]  but it's happening with a higher degree of intellect
[02:29:22.770 --> 02:29:24.890]  than the organic food movement happened.
[02:29:24.890 --> 02:29:26.530]  You know, like that organic food movement,
[02:29:26.530 --> 02:29:27.610]  the living soil movement,
[02:29:27.610 --> 02:29:29.170]  like these happened very, very quickly
[02:29:29.170 --> 02:29:31.370]  and people didn't even get it.
[02:29:31.370 --> 02:29:33.410]  And I think now that we've had all these mislabeling,
[02:29:33.410 --> 02:29:34.490]  people go, oh, that's organic.
[02:29:34.490 --> 02:29:35.530]  Oh, that's not actually organic.
[02:29:35.530 --> 02:29:37.290]  We just put it on the fucking label.
[02:29:37.290 --> 02:29:38.370]  Now that we're actually getting it,
[02:29:38.370 --> 02:29:40.730]  like I bought sugar the other day, it was organic.
[02:29:40.730 --> 02:29:43.690]  It's like pure refined sugar and like what?
[02:29:43.690 --> 02:29:45.810]  I'm like, okay, it's like powdered refined sugar.
[02:29:45.810 --> 02:29:47.890]  Like how did you shipping me sugar
[02:29:47.890 --> 02:29:49.090]  across the country organic?
[02:29:49.090 --> 02:29:50.330]  Like I don't, I know,
[02:29:51.050 --> 02:29:53.650]  these things don't certify up in my mind.
[02:29:53.650 --> 02:29:56.130]  So I'm excited to see the regenerative agriculture,
[02:29:56.130 --> 02:29:57.490]  like the closing down of things.
[02:29:57.490 --> 02:30:00.170]  Like I even hear of people in big nutrient companies
[02:30:00.170 --> 02:30:02.890]  starting to work on structural platforms
[02:30:02.890 --> 02:30:05.330]  where they establish small hubs,
[02:30:05.330 --> 02:30:08.850]  where they'll set up like essentially a fermentation space
[02:30:08.850 --> 02:30:10.610]  where they'll take all the local components,
[02:30:10.610 --> 02:30:12.730]  ingredients and products
[02:30:12.730 --> 02:30:16.930]  and create like a higher level extraction process
[02:30:16.930 --> 02:30:18.890]  to feed the community.
[02:30:18.890 --> 02:30:20.250]  Because I don't think everybody needs
[02:30:20.250 --> 02:30:21.730]  to be making ferments in their backyard.
[02:30:21.730 --> 02:30:24.050]  I think it would be better if like my local block,
[02:30:24.050 --> 02:30:26.290]  everybody committed all of their product,
[02:30:26.290 --> 02:30:28.810]  all of their leftover, all of their scraps.
[02:30:28.810 --> 02:30:30.730]  And there was one person that was in charge of it
[02:30:30.730 --> 02:30:32.650]  that was really good at it.
[02:30:32.650 --> 02:30:35.570]  That would be like the intelligent move for me
[02:30:35.570 --> 02:30:36.890]  moving forward in society.
[02:30:36.890 --> 02:30:40.050]  Cause you know, we do need to narrow down these scapes a lot.
[02:30:42.970 --> 02:30:44.170]  And that event is dope.
[02:30:44.170 --> 02:30:47.530]  So maybe we should talk about it for next year.
[02:30:47.530 --> 02:30:49.650]  Yeah, like upscale is cool.
[02:30:50.810 --> 02:30:53.090]  Sorry, I say Wade like 80,000 times there.
[02:30:53.090 --> 02:30:55.930]  My kids are just not helping me keep on track.
[02:30:55.930 --> 02:30:56.770]  Yeah.
[02:30:56.770 --> 02:30:57.970]  It's all good, dude.
[02:30:57.970 --> 02:31:00.650]  Well, we're almost running out of time anyway.
[02:31:00.650 --> 02:31:02.970]  So it's all good.
[02:31:02.970 --> 02:31:04.610]  Yeah, that's fine.
[02:31:04.610 --> 02:31:07.050]  We can probably open it to some questions real quick
[02:31:07.050 --> 02:31:09.450]  and then, you know,
[02:31:09.450 --> 02:31:11.930]  anybody has any last minute questions for Sheldon?
[02:31:16.980 --> 02:31:17.820]  Get them in.
[02:31:18.820 --> 02:31:23.820]  I'd like to see a cup where it is equally cannabis
[02:31:25.140 --> 02:31:29.140]  and equally just farmers growing and bringing products
[02:31:29.140 --> 02:31:31.300]  that aren't even necessarily cannabis related.
[02:31:31.300 --> 02:31:34.660]  Like just a big farmer's market, if you will,
[02:31:34.660 --> 02:31:36.100]  that, you know, you can have judgment,
[02:31:36.100 --> 02:31:37.180]  whatever you want to do that way.
[02:31:37.180 --> 02:31:39.620]  But I think just having some diversity
[02:31:39.620 --> 02:31:42.140]  in the conglomerate of people there
[02:31:42.140 --> 02:31:43.380]  and the different interests
[02:31:43.380 --> 02:31:45.460]  and things that people bring to the table,
[02:31:45.460 --> 02:31:47.340]  you don't have this just one thing.
[02:31:47.860 --> 02:31:49.340]  It's just one niche of that.
[02:31:49.340 --> 02:31:50.180]  It's just so heavy.
[02:31:50.180 --> 02:31:52.140]  You know, there's such a heavy energy in cannabis
[02:31:52.140 --> 02:31:55.180]  when it's just concentrated around focus just on that.
[02:31:55.180 --> 02:31:56.460]  And I don't know, you know,
[02:31:56.460 --> 02:31:59.940]  maybe bringing in some diversity into the situation
[02:31:59.940 --> 02:32:01.820]  and just leveling out the whole,
[02:32:01.820 --> 02:32:04.340]  making it a whole event, more wholesome event.
[02:32:05.300 --> 02:32:06.140]  I don't know.
[02:32:06.140 --> 02:32:08.020]  I feel like there'd be less issues in that kind of scenario,
[02:32:08.020 --> 02:32:10.880]  just naturally, but that's just me.
[02:32:12.060 --> 02:32:14.460]  That would be pretty cool to see somebody,
[02:32:14.460 --> 02:32:16.780]  if they were able to hit like a trifecta or something,
[02:32:17.220 --> 02:32:19.460]  like, you know, your vegetables, your flowers,
[02:32:19.460 --> 02:32:20.820]  and your cannabis flowers,
[02:32:20.820 --> 02:32:22.820]  they're all more on point this year.
[02:32:22.820 --> 02:32:23.860]  It's like, I know people-
[02:32:23.860 --> 02:32:26.140]  Like, all right, that individual's killing it.
[02:32:26.140 --> 02:32:26.980]  Yeah.
[02:32:29.860 --> 02:32:31.420]  KNF farmers and stuff, I know,
[02:32:31.420 --> 02:32:33.740]  like they grow some really exquisite food
[02:32:33.740 --> 02:32:36.780]  and like really exquisite like products that they make.
[02:32:36.780 --> 02:32:38.820]  You know, one of my mentors,
[02:32:38.820 --> 02:32:40.060]  I don't know if you want to be shouted or not,
[02:32:40.060 --> 02:32:41.460]  but he makes a really good hot sauce.
[02:32:41.460 --> 02:32:44.460]  It's like taking, you know, the community by a storm.
[02:32:44.460 --> 02:32:46.460]  Can't, you know, get it out to people enough.
[02:32:47.140 --> 02:32:47.980]  It's like he would have an opportunity
[02:32:47.980 --> 02:32:48.940]  for something like that.
[02:32:48.940 --> 02:32:50.900]  And it's just not, you know,
[02:32:50.900 --> 02:32:53.440]  there's farmers markets and stuff, but I don't know.
[02:32:53.440 --> 02:32:54.900]  I think it would just be cool to come together
[02:32:54.900 --> 02:32:57.700]  as a whole regenerative community and not just cannabis.
[02:32:58.960 --> 02:33:00.700]  Like a regenerative focused type.
[02:33:00.700 --> 02:33:02.820]  That's kind of like what we're talking about,
[02:33:02.820 --> 02:33:04.820]  Camp Compost heading up next year.
[02:33:04.820 --> 02:33:07.860]  You know, to me, I get that feeling of community up there.
[02:33:07.860 --> 02:33:08.700]  They're like, you know,
[02:33:08.700 --> 02:33:11.100]  bring your carload of goods with you, you know,
[02:33:11.100 --> 02:33:11.940]  kind of thing.
[02:33:11.940 --> 02:33:14.260]  And then, you know, kind of share them up
[02:33:14.260 --> 02:33:15.980]  while you're there, trade them, whatever.
[02:33:16.500 --> 02:33:17.460]  So I think that might be,
[02:33:17.460 --> 02:33:19.060]  I think you're onto something there, man.
[02:33:19.060 --> 02:33:22.340]  Because food is important, you know what I mean?
[02:33:24.540 --> 02:33:25.620]  Yeah, the older you get,
[02:33:25.620 --> 02:33:29.860]  it's like you really value the quality of stuff, you know?
[02:33:29.860 --> 02:33:31.460]  Like you can tell the difference
[02:33:31.460 --> 02:33:33.160]  if you eat something terrible,
[02:33:33.160 --> 02:33:34.980]  where if you eat like a strong,
[02:33:34.980 --> 02:33:37.860]  whatever you consider like a strong, healthy meal.
[02:33:37.860 --> 02:33:38.940]  Exactly.
[02:33:38.940 --> 02:33:41.420]  It's noticeable, I think, the older you get, man.
[02:33:42.360 --> 02:33:45.460]  Where when you're younger, you can run on bullshit fuel,
[02:33:45.980 --> 02:33:49.060]  you know, shitty carbs and all that, I think, for a while.
[02:33:49.060 --> 02:33:51.300]  Yeah, but food makes a huge difference, I think,
[02:33:51.300 --> 02:33:53.620]  if you can dial that in when you're young.
[02:33:53.620 --> 02:33:56.020]  So it's like a performance vehicle, man.
[02:33:56.020 --> 02:33:58.100]  You gotta run that good gas, you know what I mean?
[02:33:58.100 --> 02:33:59.100]  You run a cheap gas,
[02:33:59.100 --> 02:34:03.140]  you're gonna have issues down the road, you know what I mean?
[02:34:03.140 --> 02:34:03.980]  Hey, which-
[02:34:03.980 --> 02:34:06.340]  You can produce the gas if you ain't got the gas, baby.
[02:34:06.340 --> 02:34:07.820]  That's true.
[02:34:07.820 --> 02:34:09.280]  Hey, I don't know about you guys,
[02:34:09.280 --> 02:34:11.740]  but if you don't buy your gas at Costco
[02:34:11.740 --> 02:34:13.140]  and you have to buy the premium,
[02:34:13.140 --> 02:34:14.680]  you are missing out, dude.
[02:34:14.680 --> 02:34:16.640]  That shit is sometimes a dollar cheaper
[02:34:16.640 --> 02:34:19.360]  than the other place across the street.
[02:34:19.360 --> 02:34:21.760]  I don't know how Costco does that,
[02:34:21.760 --> 02:34:23.680]  but it's a top tier gasoline as well,
[02:34:23.680 --> 02:34:25.240]  if that shit matters to you.
[02:34:25.240 --> 02:34:27.760]  So that's a little tidbit, man.
[02:34:27.760 --> 02:34:30.400]  Costco is worth every penny now that gas is,
[02:34:30.400 --> 02:34:33.560]  the membership's worth every penny now that gas is up there.
[02:34:38.250 --> 02:34:39.390]  We have any questions?
[02:34:43.230 --> 02:34:47.070]  Can Sheldon explain what he's doing in the WCA on Instagram?
[02:34:47.070 --> 02:34:48.630]  Are you distilling the vinegar?
[02:34:50.750 --> 02:34:54.030]  So yeah, I posted that earlier today
[02:34:54.030 --> 02:34:56.230]  and I had this whole big long description,
[02:34:56.230 --> 02:34:58.990]  like typed up explaining step-by-step what I did,
[02:34:58.990 --> 02:35:00.510]  all the ratios and everything.
[02:35:00.510 --> 02:35:03.070]  And I posted it and I got this weird notification
[02:35:03.070 --> 02:35:06.190]  from Instagram, close it out, the post disappeared.
[02:35:06.190 --> 02:35:08.550]  So I'm like, you have got to be kidding me.
[02:35:08.550 --> 02:35:10.430]  I should learn my lesson by now to copy and paste
[02:35:10.430 --> 02:35:12.670]  into like notes or something before I hit post.
[02:35:12.670 --> 02:35:14.510]  But anyway, I reposted it and I said,
[02:35:14.510 --> 02:35:15.390]  instead of typing it again,
[02:35:15.390 --> 02:35:18.390]  I just gave it a short description.
[02:35:19.390 --> 02:35:22.710]  Anyway, what is, is I,
[02:35:22.710 --> 02:35:26.310]  it's a theory I had I wanted to test out for a while.
[02:35:26.310 --> 02:35:28.270]  Taking water soluble calcium,
[02:35:28.270 --> 02:35:30.910]  the solution where you mix vinegar with egg shells
[02:35:30.910 --> 02:35:34.590]  and taking that and filtering it really well
[02:35:35.550 --> 02:35:37.430]  and running it through a distiller.
[02:35:37.430 --> 02:35:41.410]  And whereas that you're kind of reclaiming the vinegar out,
[02:35:42.450 --> 02:35:45.070]  it concentrates it down into like a solid basically,
[02:35:45.070 --> 02:35:48.950]  whatever is in solution in that vinegar is concentrated.
[02:35:48.950 --> 02:35:51.430]  So I did that, dried it out really good
[02:35:51.430 --> 02:35:55.550]  and crushed it up in a pestle and mortar into like a powder.
[02:35:55.550 --> 02:35:56.750]  And I was thinking, I was like,
[02:35:56.750 --> 02:35:59.950]  well, if the calcium is in this solution,
[02:35:59.950 --> 02:36:04.050]  then it's just pure calcium basically, right?
[02:36:04.050 --> 02:36:06.470]  And then I put it in some water, some distilled water,
[02:36:06.470 --> 02:36:08.150]  like zero parts per million starting.
[02:36:08.150 --> 02:36:13.150]  And one gram had around 500 parts per million
[02:36:14.150 --> 02:36:15.070]  of whatever it is, you know,
[02:36:15.070 --> 02:36:16.630]  I can't say if it's pure calcium or whatever,
[02:36:16.630 --> 02:36:18.430]  I'm not sending it to a lab or tested or anything.
[02:36:18.430 --> 02:36:21.150]  It's just still just kind of first run through,
[02:36:21.150 --> 02:36:22.270]  just for fun, really.
[02:36:22.270 --> 02:36:23.510]  This is the kind of stuff I'm talking about,
[02:36:23.510 --> 02:36:25.830]  experiment with just to see, you know,
[02:36:25.830 --> 02:36:27.990]  not necessarily to change the game or anything by any means,
[02:36:27.990 --> 02:36:30.310]  just to see out of curiosity.
[02:36:30.310 --> 02:36:31.550]  That's what that is.
[02:36:31.550 --> 02:36:32.390]  That's cool, man.
[02:36:32.390 --> 02:36:33.470]  That's an experiment.
[02:36:33.470 --> 02:36:34.890]  And when you experiment,
[02:36:34.890 --> 02:36:37.110]  you have to still have principles behind it.
[02:36:37.110 --> 02:36:38.390]  He explained what he was doing.
[02:36:38.390 --> 02:36:39.870]  He dissolved the calcium
[02:36:39.870 --> 02:36:42.270]  and then he distilled it to try to re-extract it.
[02:36:42.270 --> 02:36:44.190]  I mean, that makes great sense.
[02:36:44.190 --> 02:36:45.030]  That's cool.
[02:36:45.030 --> 02:36:47.350]  That's where the new tech is coming from,
[02:36:47.350 --> 02:36:49.550]  I feel like, is those kinds of experiments.
[02:36:51.590 --> 02:36:52.430]  It's fun stuff.
[02:36:56.160 --> 02:36:57.760]  You got other questions, London?
[02:36:58.640 --> 02:37:01.160]  I'm just trying to scan through here.
[02:37:02.840 --> 02:37:07.360]  Have you tried matching FFJ's desired terp flavors?
[02:37:08.920 --> 02:37:12.000]  No, that's a question I've seen a lot
[02:37:12.000 --> 02:37:15.760]  and I don't think that works how people think it does.
[02:37:15.760 --> 02:37:18.720]  I don't think you're gonna extract terpenes
[02:37:18.720 --> 02:37:20.920]  in a ferment and that's gonna bring out
[02:37:20.920 --> 02:37:22.680]  that type of terpene in your plant.
[02:37:23.960 --> 02:37:25.640]  I'm calling it old row science.
[02:37:25.640 --> 02:37:27.360]  Some of the original kind of theories
[02:37:27.360 --> 02:37:28.800]  that were out there way back in the day,
[02:37:28.800 --> 02:37:31.160]  I'm pretty sure have been debunked since then.
[02:37:32.480 --> 02:37:33.600]  Now what you can do though,
[02:37:33.600 --> 02:37:37.000]  is kind of help bring out the most you can in a plant,
[02:37:37.000 --> 02:37:41.000]  but not to specifically target that terp, to me, no.
[02:37:42.000 --> 02:37:42.840]  Right.
[02:37:44.520 --> 02:37:47.400]  What's your favorite live vinegar to use?
[02:37:49.000 --> 02:37:50.440]  Brown rice vinegar.
[02:37:50.440 --> 02:37:53.880]  So that's one of those things that it is used
[02:37:53.880 --> 02:37:55.680]  for a very good reason in the system.
[02:37:56.600 --> 02:38:00.000]  The particular amino acid profile of brown rice vinegar
[02:38:00.000 --> 02:38:03.040]  is actually a certain composition and concentration
[02:38:03.040 --> 02:38:05.080]  that is beneficial.
[02:38:05.080 --> 02:38:06.120]  Sorry, I've run out of water,
[02:38:06.120 --> 02:38:07.880]  if you can hear all my mouth noises.
[02:38:08.480 --> 02:38:13.000]  So I like rice vinegar, but even better than that
[02:38:13.000 --> 02:38:15.680]  is whatever one I can make for almost free.
[02:38:16.600 --> 02:38:19.280]  Literally any living vinegar will do the job.
[02:38:19.280 --> 02:38:21.880]  So if you've made FPJ or FFJ or whatever,
[02:38:21.880 --> 02:38:23.800]  use the leftovers, you can make a vinegar out of that
[02:38:23.800 --> 02:38:25.640]  and it will serve the purpose in KNF.
[02:38:26.560 --> 02:38:29.520]  Shout out Heather, screaming demon cannabis.
[02:38:32.270 --> 02:38:33.390]  Awesome.
[02:38:33.390 --> 02:38:36.390]  Bear B-par, blue graph screens
[02:38:36.390 --> 02:38:38.510]  and where can we find you on social media?
[02:38:39.310 --> 02:38:42.510]  I think it's all in the description of the show.
[02:38:42.510 --> 02:38:45.710]  My Instagram, there's got a discord,
[02:38:45.710 --> 02:38:46.870]  definitely recommend coming there
[02:38:46.870 --> 02:38:48.190]  if this kind of thing interests you,
[02:38:48.190 --> 02:38:50.310]  it's all broken down like every single different
[02:38:50.310 --> 02:38:51.670]  KNF input and such.
[02:38:51.670 --> 02:38:53.510]  We've got channels dedicated to each one
[02:38:53.510 --> 02:38:57.270]  and a great community there, come check that out.
[02:38:57.270 --> 02:38:59.910]  But mostly active on Instagram at the moment,
[02:38:59.910 --> 02:39:01.870]  actually mostly active in the discord,
[02:39:01.870 --> 02:39:04.630]  but as far as like mainstream social media is concerned,
[02:39:04.630 --> 02:39:07.230]  Instagram is where you'd find me at bluegrass green thumb.
[02:39:12.790 --> 02:39:15.110]  Last one, does anyone know how to make
[02:39:15.110 --> 02:39:16.670]  water soluble yucca powder?
[02:39:19.510 --> 02:39:20.350]  I don't.
[02:39:21.790 --> 02:39:24.870]  I don't, I use other sources of saponins.
[02:39:24.870 --> 02:39:26.870]  And if you were going to do that, yeah,
[02:39:26.870 --> 02:39:29.550]  I would, I don't know that this is the right way,
[02:39:29.550 --> 02:39:31.790]  but I would probably think you need to dry it out
[02:39:31.790 --> 02:39:36.790]  and then micronize it, blend it to a fine powder.
[02:39:36.910 --> 02:39:39.830]  But I'm gonna do your research on that one, I'm not sure.
[02:39:40.430 --> 02:39:42.150]  Oh, well, if you're making it,
[02:39:42.150 --> 02:39:43.670]  I guess I don't have an answer for that,
[02:39:43.670 --> 02:39:45.990]  but if you're trying to buy something really cheap,
[02:39:45.990 --> 02:39:48.550]  there's an old school company that a lot of the older heads
[02:39:48.550 --> 02:39:51.230]  used even before Build-A-Soil was around
[02:39:51.230 --> 02:39:53.150]  called Kelp for Less.
[02:39:53.150 --> 02:39:55.110]  And they sell, I think a couple,
[02:39:55.110 --> 02:39:58.390]  or they used to sell a couple of varieties of yucca.
[02:39:58.390 --> 02:39:59.950]  So if that's something that interests you
[02:39:59.950 --> 02:40:02.470]  where you might just spend a couple of dollars,
[02:40:02.470 --> 02:40:05.070]  Kelp for Less has been around for a long, long time.
[02:40:09.960 --> 02:40:11.200]  And that's about it.
[02:40:13.840 --> 02:40:15.680]  All right, Sheldon, we appreciate it, man.
[02:40:15.680 --> 02:40:20.080]  And again, coming back next, getting thrown into the mix
[02:40:20.080 --> 02:40:23.120]  and kind of just putting in your input last week,
[02:40:23.120 --> 02:40:24.880]  opening up your brain this week.
[02:40:24.880 --> 02:40:26.040]  We appreciate your time.
[02:40:26.040 --> 02:40:29.640]  And I don't think enough people realize that time is,
[02:40:29.640 --> 02:40:31.760]  for a lot of us, more important than money
[02:40:31.760 --> 02:40:34.600]  because we only get so much of it.
[02:40:34.600 --> 02:40:36.200]  So to give three hours last week
[02:40:36.200 --> 02:40:38.040]  and three hours this week, brother,
[02:40:38.040 --> 02:40:41.160]  just kind of, again, man, we just really appreciate it.
[02:40:41.160 --> 02:40:42.560]  Yeah, thank you, man.
[02:40:42.720 --> 02:40:44.640]  I appreciate you guys for giving me the opportunity
[02:40:44.640 --> 02:40:45.960]  to come on here and talk.
[02:40:45.960 --> 02:40:50.240]  This is my passion and helping other people learn this stuff
[02:40:50.240 --> 02:40:51.760]  is a major part of that passion.
[02:40:51.760 --> 02:40:55.440]  And again, this is all therapy for me in deeper ways.
[02:40:55.440 --> 02:40:58.040]  So I appreciate it a whole lot
[02:40:58.040 --> 02:40:59.880]  and appreciate you guys just for having a space
[02:40:59.880 --> 02:41:01.240]  to have these kinds of discussions
[02:41:01.240 --> 02:41:04.120]  and education for the people.
[02:41:05.200 --> 02:41:07.600]  We all grow together that way, right?
[02:41:07.600 --> 02:41:09.200]  Boom.
[02:41:09.200 --> 02:41:11.360]  And I, again, shout out to,
[02:41:11.360 --> 02:41:13.240]  more like a salute to Mr. London,
[02:41:13.240 --> 02:41:17.480]  catching a fourth in law to even have this show.
[02:41:18.840 --> 02:41:19.720]  Just appreciate that.
[02:41:19.720 --> 02:41:21.320]  Hopefully we'll work behind the scenes
[02:41:21.320 --> 02:41:23.160]  to see what was going on there.
[02:41:23.160 --> 02:41:24.520]  But London, again, buddy,
[02:41:24.520 --> 02:41:25.880]  it seems like you're always stepping up
[02:41:25.880 --> 02:41:27.000]  for the community, man.
[02:41:27.000 --> 02:41:28.800]  And I just wanted to highlight that.
[02:41:28.800 --> 02:41:31.120]  Again, you're kind of showing your stripes
[02:41:31.120 --> 02:41:32.080]  coming through for us.
[02:41:32.080 --> 02:41:33.400]  So we just appreciate that.
[02:41:33.400 --> 02:41:35.200]  And I think as time progresses,
[02:41:35.200 --> 02:41:36.720]  you are gonna be the,
[02:41:38.040 --> 02:41:39.080]  well, I hope I don't offend,
[02:41:39.120 --> 02:41:40.400]  but you're like the Ryan Seacrest
[02:41:40.400 --> 02:41:42.720]  of the Canadian cannabis world, man.
[02:41:44.200 --> 02:41:45.920]  I didn't mean to offend,
[02:41:45.920 --> 02:41:47.880]  but it seems like you're everywhere.
[02:41:47.880 --> 02:41:50.000]  And that's kind of the-
[02:41:50.000 --> 02:41:53.440]  Our favorite Canadian is Ryan Reynolds.
[02:41:53.440 --> 02:41:54.280]  All right, you're the Ryan.
[02:41:54.280 --> 02:41:55.760]  You're not that handsome, so I'm sorry.
[02:41:55.760 --> 02:41:57.280]  I would take that too, bro.
[02:41:57.280 --> 02:41:58.840]  Yeah, that does sound like.
[02:41:58.840 --> 02:42:00.960]  You're the Ryan Reynolds of the cannabis world, man.
[02:42:00.960 --> 02:42:03.440]  Cause it seems like you're at a lot of the major events.
[02:42:03.440 --> 02:42:04.280]  And like I had mentioned,
[02:42:04.280 --> 02:42:06.160]  the one on top of that rooftop,
[02:42:06.160 --> 02:42:08.120]  I mean, that was picturesque.
[02:42:08.160 --> 02:42:09.360]  I mean, that would be something
[02:42:09.360 --> 02:42:11.120]  that I would personally wanna fly in for,
[02:42:11.120 --> 02:42:12.560]  just the experience.
[02:42:12.560 --> 02:42:16.600]  Seems, it seemed like it would be worth the trip.
[02:42:16.600 --> 02:42:17.800]  Day two was a mess.
[02:42:17.800 --> 02:42:19.840]  But what I would probably suggest
[02:42:19.840 --> 02:42:21.920]  with you guys coming out for,
[02:42:21.920 --> 02:42:25.160]  there's the Kine Festival would be one of them.
[02:42:25.160 --> 02:42:26.960]  They do some really good Toronto ones,
[02:42:26.960 --> 02:42:29.640]  Hall of Flowers out there too.
[02:42:29.640 --> 02:42:32.080]  Might be a little bit close to your side as well.
[02:42:33.120 --> 02:42:34.400]  But yeah, there's a few things coming up.
[02:42:34.400 --> 02:42:35.240]  Thanks guys.
[02:42:35.240 --> 02:42:36.080]  I appreciate it.
[02:42:36.080 --> 02:42:36.920]  I'm always happy to help.
[02:42:38.560 --> 02:42:41.400]  Yeah, do you wanna promote any of that stuff coming up?
[02:42:41.400 --> 02:42:42.720]  And then we can kind of sign off here.
[02:42:42.720 --> 02:42:45.400]  We'll give Shelton like kind of the last word with Marco.
[02:42:45.400 --> 02:42:46.760]  I have no idea.
[02:42:46.760 --> 02:42:49.360]  I got, oh, Tuesday we have some good shows.
[02:42:49.360 --> 02:42:51.880]  It's my season finales of the year.
[02:42:51.880 --> 02:42:53.160]  So we're season two done.
[02:42:53.160 --> 02:42:55.160]  So year two of each of my shows will be done
[02:42:55.160 --> 02:42:57.160]  and we're inviting back all the guests.
[02:42:57.160 --> 02:42:58.000]  So I'm excited.
[02:42:58.000 --> 02:43:02.360]  Like we'll have like Marcus, Jorge Cervantes
[02:43:02.360 --> 02:43:04.920]  and like some really cool guys
[02:43:04.920 --> 02:43:07.640]  from like all in the same room together.
[02:43:08.160 --> 02:43:11.320]  So it'll be fun and probably quite exhausting.
[02:43:11.320 --> 02:43:13.280]  And we're gonna push Steam Yard to the limit
[02:43:13.280 --> 02:43:14.840]  and see how many-
[02:43:14.840 --> 02:43:17.240]  We have a six box going.
[02:43:17.240 --> 02:43:19.920]  Yeah, well we did about, oh shit.
[02:43:19.920 --> 02:43:22.280]  We did about 30 episodes last year,
[02:43:22.280 --> 02:43:24.680]  35 episodes in each one with a unique guest.
[02:43:24.680 --> 02:43:28.480]  So there's about 30 something invitees as guests.
[02:43:31.680 --> 02:43:33.440]  Not tomorrow, Tuesday, Tuesday, Tuesday,
[02:43:33.440 --> 02:43:34.400]  that and the Dank Hour.
[02:43:34.400 --> 02:43:37.040]  So the Dank Hour evening one will be like Jeff Lowenfeld.
[02:43:37.440 --> 02:43:41.680]  We got Dr. James White, Robert Henry, Philip Henry,
[02:43:41.680 --> 02:43:43.120]  like just a ridiculous amount.
[02:43:43.120 --> 02:43:44.560]  So both are season finales.
[02:43:44.560 --> 02:43:47.720]  And then I'm on break to plan for next year
[02:43:47.720 --> 02:43:49.680]  because there's some crazy shit happening
[02:43:49.680 --> 02:43:52.600]  and I need a moment to relax and be with family
[02:43:52.600 --> 02:43:54.880]  and focus on that to prepare.
[02:43:55.920 --> 02:43:57.240]  Break is good, man.
[02:43:57.240 --> 02:43:59.760]  I'm on an IG break right now.
[02:43:59.760 --> 02:44:01.480]  Yeah, it must be nice, man.
[02:44:01.480 --> 02:44:02.320]  I got it.
[02:44:02.320 --> 02:44:03.560]  Like I've been on an IG break for a bit.
[02:44:03.560 --> 02:44:06.000]  My IG has been suffering really bad.
[02:44:06.760 --> 02:44:09.440]  I need like, there's been no sunlight for months.
[02:44:09.440 --> 02:44:10.880]  It feels like you're in Vancouver
[02:44:10.880 --> 02:44:13.760]  and I just like, I'm done with it.
[02:44:13.760 --> 02:44:14.600]  I need a break.
[02:44:14.600 --> 02:44:15.480]  I need to relax.
[02:44:15.480 --> 02:44:16.440]  I need to refresh.
[02:44:18.720 --> 02:44:20.600]  Sheldon, you got anything coming up, man?
[02:44:20.600 --> 02:44:22.200]  Or anything you wanna highlight?
[02:44:25.400 --> 02:44:29.720]  I did just release, it's on my Patreon.
[02:44:29.720 --> 02:44:33.200]  That is how I'm making like 90% of my income these days.
[02:44:34.200 --> 02:44:38.480]  But anyway, I released it's a simple like feed chart
[02:44:38.480 --> 02:44:40.160]  for like cannabis.
[02:44:40.160 --> 02:44:42.800]  You can have a scrolls that are interested in KNF,
[02:44:42.800 --> 02:44:44.760]  if you know how to make the inputs and stuff
[02:44:44.760 --> 02:44:46.280]  but don't quite understand like,
[02:44:46.280 --> 02:44:48.440]  you know, when to apply what and how.
[02:44:50.160 --> 02:44:52.840]  Put up a pretty basic simple guide to go by.
[02:44:52.840 --> 02:44:54.720]  It's a good starting point for you to use.
[02:44:54.720 --> 02:44:56.880]  I have my suggestions on like a foundation
[02:44:56.880 --> 02:44:59.720]  as far as building a soil from scratch,
[02:44:59.720 --> 02:45:01.960]  how I go about it, my protocol,
[02:45:01.960 --> 02:45:04.280]  how to handle things throughout the grow,
[02:45:04.280 --> 02:45:05.920]  you know, making liquid IMO and such.
[02:45:05.920 --> 02:45:10.520]  So that is, I just released that incentive for you,
[02:45:10.520 --> 02:45:14.240]  if you will, go check that out.
[02:45:14.240 --> 02:45:17.240]  Again, just the Discord, that's where my community is.
[02:45:17.240 --> 02:45:20.000]  Shout out to my family there that, you know,
[02:45:20.000 --> 02:45:22.480]  kind of had my back and by my side
[02:45:22.480 --> 02:45:24.040]  through the, since the very beginning of this,
[02:45:24.040 --> 02:45:27.000]  since day one to help me build what I have so far.
[02:45:27.000 --> 02:45:29.360]  Would not be doing, I wouldn't be here today
[02:45:29.360 --> 02:45:31.280]  talking to you guys if it weren't for, you know,
[02:45:31.280 --> 02:45:32.160]  their support.
[02:45:32.160 --> 02:45:36.480]  So I wanna shout those guys out big time.
[02:45:36.480 --> 02:45:39.920]  And one, I wanna shout out a company,
[02:45:39.920 --> 02:45:42.440]  actually I don't like normally shout out companies
[02:45:42.440 --> 02:45:46.360]  and stuff, if that's okay.
[02:45:46.360 --> 02:45:47.200]  Is that cool?
[02:45:48.840 --> 02:45:50.880]  It's not General Hydroponics, is it?
[02:45:50.880 --> 02:45:51.720]  Or is it?
[02:45:51.720 --> 02:45:52.560]  Yeah, it's Hawthorne.
[02:45:52.560 --> 02:45:53.400]  No.
[02:45:53.400 --> 02:45:57.600]  I was gonna say, as long as you co-signing, round up.
[02:45:57.600 --> 02:45:59.640]  I'd like to sign up Monsanto.
[02:45:59.640 --> 02:46:01.600]  We'd like to give a big old shout out.
[02:46:02.720 --> 02:46:04.040]  Yeah.
[02:46:04.040 --> 02:46:05.880]  It's just a couple of seats.
[02:46:08.360 --> 02:46:09.960]  I see what you did.
[02:46:09.960 --> 02:46:12.880]  No, so these guys, you know me,
[02:46:12.880 --> 02:46:15.760]  I wouldn't just drop anything on a situation like this
[02:46:15.760 --> 02:46:17.120]  if I went behind it.
[02:46:17.120 --> 02:46:18.680]  I've met these people in person,
[02:46:18.680 --> 02:46:21.040]  been to their actual farm,
[02:46:21.040 --> 02:46:22.680]  where they do this stuff and everything.
[02:46:22.680 --> 02:46:24.760]  Just solid people through and through.
[02:46:27.720 --> 02:46:29.480]  They go by Lost Highway Farms,
[02:46:29.480 --> 02:46:30.880]  is the name of their actual farm.
[02:46:30.880 --> 02:46:34.400]  And they have a product called Highway Dust.
[02:46:34.400 --> 02:46:35.480]  They just sent me some.
[02:46:35.480 --> 02:46:37.960]  It's like a soil amendment.
[02:46:37.960 --> 02:46:39.880]  And they've got a bunch of other products
[02:46:39.880 --> 02:46:41.080]  like Compost Tea Brewers.
[02:46:41.080 --> 02:46:42.920]  He's a breeder, they got seeds and stuff.
[02:46:42.920 --> 02:46:46.160]  Just really cool, regenerative farmers down the earth.
[02:46:46.160 --> 02:46:47.160]  You may not have heard about them
[02:46:47.160 --> 02:46:48.080]  because they're busy farming.
[02:46:48.080 --> 02:46:49.560]  You know, you talk about grassroots,
[02:46:49.560 --> 02:46:51.320]  these guys are as grassroots as it gets.
[02:46:51.320 --> 02:46:53.560]  And they've been supportive of me
[02:46:53.560 --> 02:46:55.920]  and just wanna give them a shout out.
[02:46:56.880 --> 02:46:57.720]  Good deal.
[02:46:59.840 --> 02:47:00.760]  Hell yeah.
[02:47:00.760 --> 02:47:03.960]  Well, I just wanna, I guess, last shout out,
[02:47:03.960 --> 02:47:06.240]  there's a woman, Denise, and my wife.
[02:47:06.240 --> 02:47:10.880]  They're putting together for 63 families in my living room,
[02:47:10.880 --> 02:47:12.800]  all their kids' Christmas presents.
[02:47:12.800 --> 02:47:16.080]  So whether they have five kids or two kids,
[02:47:16.080 --> 02:47:18.000]  they were able to make a small little list.
[02:47:18.000 --> 02:47:21.160]  And then we were able to buy all those toys on Black Friday.
[02:47:21.160 --> 02:47:23.640]  So it's, you know, basically close to half off
[02:47:23.640 --> 02:47:25.480]  to kind of like double the money.
[02:47:26.040 --> 02:47:28.520]  So everybody that donated to that,
[02:47:28.520 --> 02:47:29.480]  just appreciate that,
[02:47:29.480 --> 02:47:33.480]  seeing the difference that it's gonna make in 63 families.
[02:47:33.480 --> 02:47:35.400]  I know that it's a small thing,
[02:47:35.400 --> 02:47:36.560]  but at the same time,
[02:47:36.560 --> 02:47:38.520]  to be able to deliver all that
[02:47:38.520 --> 02:47:42.000]  on time for Christmas morning takes over a month.
[02:47:42.000 --> 02:47:43.880]  So just shout out to them,
[02:47:43.880 --> 02:47:46.440]  two people that I think are really changing
[02:47:46.440 --> 02:47:49.560]  their little circle, their little neighborhood.
[02:47:49.560 --> 02:47:50.400]  Nice.
[02:47:52.560 --> 02:47:54.440]  Yeah, I don't have much going on, family.
[02:47:54.440 --> 02:47:58.040]  Just living life, continuing to build on my farm,
[02:47:58.040 --> 02:47:59.720]  taking a little break from IG.
[02:47:59.720 --> 02:48:02.760]  But when I do, if I do come back to IG,
[02:48:02.760 --> 02:48:05.720]  I'm gonna have a lot of stuff to share, some cool stuff.
[02:48:05.720 --> 02:48:09.120]  So just living that life.
[02:48:11.840 --> 02:48:14.280]  All right, Sheldon, appreciate you, brother.
[02:48:14.280 --> 02:48:15.400]  Yep, thanks, Sheldon.
[02:48:15.400 --> 02:48:16.920]  Appreciate you guys.
[02:48:16.920 --> 02:48:17.800]  Thanks, Londa.
[02:48:18.840 --> 02:48:20.480]  Do I click the button now?
[02:48:20.480 --> 02:48:22.080]  Is that my sign to click the button?
[02:48:22.080 --> 02:48:22.920]  Sure.
