patience and time and just taking it easy for a moment while we set everything up.
Hopefully I'm coming through loud and clear and we are up and running and live
here on Future Cannabis Projects, the Dank Hour, your weekly jump in with
the experts where we bring you the dankest of minds, dankest of people and
dankest of conversations to dig in and really chat about the things that are
challenging in the industry, challenging in space, developing in space. We bring doctors, we bring
writers, we bring all sorts of stuff. Last week we had Jeff Lowenfeld on. We had an amazing episode
with them. We're looking forward to a lot of other amazing great shows. In a few weeks we're going to
have Dr. James White who we spoke about during the Jeff Lowenfeld episode quite a few times where
we're going to get into the writing stage cycle. So keep your eyes and ears open for all the amazing
content and make sure you're following all, if not every, and every single one of the speakers and
people that you see here on stage with me as well as following the group and all that stuff because
we have a delightful conversation ahead coming to you and as usual every single week we like to
get the conversation started with basic introductions and making sure that we have good audio
for everybody to be able to hear us loud and clear. So without any further ado we're going to go
through the stage in order of which everybody appears. Test, Dr. Anna, Johnny and then Shannon and if any of
our other experts decide to join us for the evening we will see them and introduce them as
well. Otherwise we might just pop in and out. We'll see how it goes. It's always a little bit of fun here
on the Dank Tower. But go ahead and Test and say hello to everybody out there.
Hey everybody. It's good to be here. My name is Test Edum. I'm a microbiologist and I am in Denver,
Colorado and I help cultivators build biocontrol programs and manage their microbes. So
pretty much a nerd. Hey everybody. Hi Test fellow nerd here.
Dr. Anubis. I have a PhD in cannabis genetics looking at variation in cannabis with a
sort of with a backdrop using genetic tools to figure out how and why cannabis has so much
variation in the phenotype and chemotype. I work in currently in New Jersey working for a company
growing both hemp and soon we got our conditional license. So we're going to build
out a facility to be growing THC type cannabis using aquaponics. So fish to feed the plants
and the plants to clean the water for the fish. It's a closed loop system and it's really
interesting. So I'm happy I've been away for a little bit but I'm back in full force and I should
be here every Tuesday and I'm so happy to be back. And this should be an exciting episode. I'm excited
to learn some stuff. Hey everybody. I am Johnny also a nerd not a doctor but you know it's not
the realm of possibilities. I am a cannabis cultivator by trade and cannabis nerd by passion
and choice. I am excited to be here tonight with all of you and Shannon I believe you are next.
Hey everybody. My name is Shannon Ross and I am coming from the Kootenai region in B.C. and I am a
long time cannabis farmer, advocate and I have done things from farming, from helping people
transitioning from legacy to legal. I've been involved in a lot of policy stuff and I also
am one of the co-founders of Antidote and CEO of Antidote which is a standard processing facility
that is grower owned and grower driven. So thanks for having me. Awesome and as usual I am your
master of moderation, director of dialogue and all around weirdo who likes to talk about cannabis.
And as usual we are back here every single Tuesday at 5 p.m. enjoying the conversation. We'll be here
all the time except for we're going to take a little break at Christmas but then we'll have
a whole new season. I mean we've been doing this for like a year and a half so we will have a whole
new season coming up in the next year with a whole bunch of amazing stuff and we're really going to
dig into it and have some fun today. There's an interesting point that's happening right now in
Canada. There's this big change in moving forward into the legal to legacy space and it's fucking
weird and challenging and kind of I think important because it's telling the story of how cannabis
and how farms and how things are changing in the country that's legalized it and how it's going to
develop into it. Now Shannon is is core and central in the community out there and the grower in the
woods for a little bit so I think one of the the best ways because this is going to be a little bit
I think more focused around community advocacy and growth and development as a whole. I think the best
way to start this off Shannon is to throw you the biggest fucking zinger I have. The Hail Mary,
the showstopper, the one that I say all the time. Not that boring old how do you first the how's that
how's the first time you smoked cannabis. Not that the usual lame-o talk to me about the first
pot rally you went to. I want to know about the moment the transition point and the time that it
went from cannabis consumption for you Shannon to cannabis advocacy. When did when did that
evolution change? When did that modality happen? Because often I find for people that that that
are passionate consumers and connoisseurs and growers they go through this stage where you know
we start off as cannabis you know consumers and there's a point where there's a realization at
some point where it becomes something more as the advocacy level. So I would love to hear about that
from from you to get the conversation started. There's a there's I think it's not just one
turning point there's been many turning points and it like it my advocacy is from experiencing
very specific kind of turning points and so what really started it off into an advocacy piece was
back in 1998. I was working as a street youth councillor for the downtown east side in Vancouver
and I at that time I was helping youth you know being a safe place providing a safe environment
and just being you know a good person to help lead people into a good direction but also very
compassionate around mental health issues and trauma where people come from and at the time I
was living off of commercial drive just right near the Croatian cultural center and that was when
the compassion clubs kind of started and it was just something I kind of witnessed and at the
same time there was the Amsterdam cafe and there was all these kind of you know medical
movements that were happening in the downtown east side and I was kind of witnessing it and then
started to have experience with people who were trying to get off of hard drugs or just looking
for a place that offered more natural healthy ways to make changes so that was one of the major
turning points for me but there was also other turning points in my life where I remember just
you know being extremely nauseous and you know someone saying hey why don't if you need to take a
break from puking have just one little taste of this and then I instantly had this major relief
and I just remember thinking to myself and having friends of mine that have terminal ill cancer
and you know have a hard time keeping food down or you know just the kind of suffering that people
go through and having these many experiences where I saw cannabis work its magic that was just this
very natural gentle way that provided a lot of healing and relief and behind it a real more kind
of gentle and compassionate way and so that there's a long I could talk forever but I would
think that's some of the key pieces and I've also had some things where cannabis really
changed my life personally which I can talk about another time but thank you.
Well we don't stretch away from that too much we always love to push the conversation but
that being said we've got a lot to talk about and a very little time to do within and we of course
want to open up at the end for questions and stuff like that but we need to we need to kind of first
set the groundwork so you were you know you grew up passionately in a point where advocacy was
ripe where people were developing and changing and Vancouver was stepping into this new kind of
light and change and then and you were growing when did you start working with plants are you
a grower you're a processor what what what what drove you to it like where where do you see
yourself are you touching plants on the daily are you processing things what because I mean
as though as you mentioned with the processor where do you see yourself are you a grower what
exactly you know do you label yourself I hate labeling myself but you know what I mean.
That's a it's a it's a great question I am a grower for sure I first planted my first plant
in the mountains here in the Kootenays in about 2003 2004 and you know I'll never forget that
moment where a good friend of mine was like well you're a farmer you're here you know you you gotta
learn the lifestyle you gotta get yourself a mountain bike and I'm gonna you know teach you
how to grow some weeds so you know that was my first kind of christening into the Kootenays
and I sure enough I got a mountain bike and and learned how to bike up steep mountains and carry
things on my back and go into the mountains and it just started to progress from there I had a
lot of friends that actually grew for the compassion club here in the Kootenays and
I just kind of got you know thrown into a huge culture where you know I was
hiking hiking weed processing weed planting weed the growing weed for a very very long time so
definitely a grower that being said I have my four plants I do a lot of cultivation I do a
lot of consulting I do a lot of help with other people's grows but right now my primary focus
is to get a processing facility up and running in the Kootenay region and so I've put a lot of
those things to the side not necessarily 100 because I'm still in the field and you know and
still working with the plant all the time throughout the for outdoor growing and I love it
and it's so important to me to have that connection to the plant and and I don't want to
lose that but right now I am focused on getting antidote up and running so and and basically I'm
just there to help with licensing and business planning as well as packaging processing and sales
and and getting all the infrastructure in place for all the Kootenay growers to you know to
transition into the legal market in a way that's kind of simple and smooth where they keep their
own intellectual property and that is in alignment with the culture of cannabis here in the Kootenays
because ever since legalization I've been kind of that's what kind of shot me off into this
direction of processing and building this is because it was just a lot of people from the
outside coming into the Kootenays with grandiose ideas but it really I saw that there was a lot of
just people kind of taking advantage of other people's intellectual property
and I just wanted to really create something that was different that was fair and simple
and in alignment with the values of the culture and and that is right now my primary focus
and we are just a few months from opening our doors so the heat is on.
You know it's kind of one of the key points and the the the the humus being of it all as it
were is we're trying to move industry forward and Kootenays has this awesome reference and background
to it and there's amazing story there and there's there's all these amazing people that that have
this awesome culture so I mean you said that you want to you want to help you want to bring that
business forward that helps and represents the community that was created you know that kind of
creative liberalization to begin with so let's let's let's dig into that a little bit what what
are those points what are those things that you see as a community that that that you are building
and integrating into the business platform of Antivirus? Well I think a lot of it has to do
with the values and I think that that is that that is a huge piece of what's been missing in
legalization is that it really started to get dominated by larger corporations and it wasn't
in the interest of all of the cannabis farmers and within the legacy world there are certain values
and codes of ethics and and and you know things that we all did that actually created and made us
very successful and I don't see a lot of that in the more in the legal world in these big corporate
structures and so the goal is is to take these kind of inherent values of things like collaboration
and benevolence being kind and genuine to each other and and and also there's
the people in the Kootenays and a lot of the cannabis culture in the Kootenays really has a
strong reverence for mother nature and you'll see that all of the top producers right now
in our local area are all working in living soil regenerative organic and a lot of people took
outdoor growing methods and brought it inside into indoor and and it was because everybody
wanted to do what's right everybody cares about our impact whether our impact is environmental
or social or economic it's it's important that we consider all of these things and and how you know
how our actions turn in and they ripple out into the world and the Kootenay region also just because
of the culture and the way that you know we are in our lifestyle and how and what we built as a
community and culture here it's it's just so unique and special and it's really a lot about
caring for each other and about this kind of love and you know for each other and I think that that
sharing the collaboration you know the caring for each other we need we can't lose that and
it's very easy to kind of get competitive and and in this kind of new industry
although it's not new but you know what I mean and and I just think that collaboration is the way to
go and that we need to bring these values into the world and we need to kind of drop the seed
of what made the Kootenays the Kootenays and why everyone comes here and why people are attracted
to this place and we need to spread that into the rest of the world and I think that that is kind of
that is kind of what Antidote is about is we want to you know change the way that you know the world
is is functioning into a healthier place where the planet and the earth is revered and are the way
that we function in the world is taking care of all of these things around us and I think it's very
important right now it's integral you know you look at the world around us and it's you know
it's concerning and it's time for very radical change and it it needs to come from a place
where there's really good values and alignment and it can't come from one person it has to come
from a whole community of people and to make this kind of change and get this message out and
cannabis is an amazing plant and everyone here is you know everyone's been hiding in the shadows and
and and the lovely thing about legalization is now we're bringing you know cannabis into the forefront
we're bringing research and development we're bringing scientists and that marrying of the
culture of cannabis and science coming together at a time like this is just blows my mind
and I just think that there we have this real moment to radically transform the world through
this plant and that's kind of how antidotes mission is to you know to help bring our
community and culture into the forefront of this. Sorry I had to save that little segment because
that was that was one hell of a fire short for for my reels later to post about you because you
were on fire there that was fucking lit Janet. Okay so we got it I I think we got to step back
a little bit and and set some ground rules not some ground rules but set some some some
foundations some understanding because not everybody that's going to be tuning in right
now or tuned in period is going to like immediately understand and have relationship and and and
development with this community culture and and and so we got it we got to first get a basic
understanding of a couple things that that will help bring up where we're at here okay and the
first thing that I think we need to do is is is is get a really good in-depth interpretation from
someone who is who has a has a real connection with the space and you Shannon is is what exactly
is the Kootenai and where is it what is it and and and tell me a little bit about the history
and culture and how you know what makes it special because it is a special place there is a there is
an energy there um so yeah that's right I think that's a pretty formed out question tail off there
well uh the Kootenai region is on uh first of all is on the traditional territories of the Sinaics
uh the Tanaha, the Selics, uh the Shuswap people uh and many First Nations in this region so uh
and the Kootenai is is uh the headwater of the Columbia River uh and it is a very uh is one of
the world's interior rainforests and it is a place that Indigenous people used to use for hunting and
fishing uh and for uh sacred uh ceremonies it is uh so that's the uh history of the Kootenai.
The more recent uh history of the Kootenai uh from where my understanding of how cannabis came here
and what you know has created this culture has a lot to do with the draft dodgers and uh people
you uh veterans escaping from the Vietnam War and coming here and uh bringing seeds with them
and kind of seeking a place of refuge uh away from all the madness in the world uh where they
could find peace and just kind of get back to the land so the Kootenai is very well known for
you know lots of uh people that come to get back to the land to garden uh to live in smaller
communities uh with and that that's kind of the origins of how cannabis production started here
and it came a lot from uh the United States as well as other people that were just trying to
get escape war and then it started to progress and it went from outdoor growing into indoor growing
uh and with the metal halides and people started uh sharing genetics and it enabled a lot of the
outdoor growers to keep their genetics going and then it started to kind of flourish from there
where lots of the growers in the 70s started sharing genetics and and experimenting and
were able to come up with other cultivars that grew well in this region and a lot of the cultivars
that uh grew have been traditionally grown in the Kootenai's are a lot of like blueberry strains and
uh uh white grizzly and other strains that moved from Vancouver Island or the California, Oregon,
Washington and so there's been this kind of network of cannabis cultivators uh throughout
the kind of uh west coast um and it's just been kind of going since then and a lot of it's really
interesting you know I was I was uh sitting with an elderly woman uh not elderly but you know she's
you know been around since the 70s and she you know she sees me at the community center here
and she's like what is the antidote and I tell her a bit about it and then she's like yeah you know
back in the 70s when we came here it was a lot of uh loggers and and you know people that were
really not into cannabis and there was lots of fights and drinking and and you know they didn't
really like us hippies kind of coming into this region until we gave them some weed and then
things kind of softened we all started to get along um so there's a lot of stories about that
and you know there's some there's the saying and you know in a specific town in this region which
I won't say specific town but uh it says that uh you know the Kootenays can turn rednecks into
hippies and hippies into rednecks and I think that that is kind of like it's I can relate to that you
know I came here as more of a hippie and uh and then I started you know learning how to grow weed
and outdoors and learn to ride dirt bikes to get up into the mountains and learn just to kind of
like toughen up and and dig deep and lean into you know the like you know the toughness of life
and I think there's a lot of people in the Kootenays that are just really into uh being in
the outdoors and uh have a real sense of um love for nature for skiing for mountain biking
for kayaking and all of these things and it's uh and because the cannabis culture has been so
such a huge part of the economy here in this region and this it's it's really shaped this
region in its like art music creativity Nelson is just a hotbed for some amazing artists and
musicians and theater and uh and it's just a very unique place that um seems to have an effect on
people and the people here uh are very unique and uh and it's it's quite lovely and I feel very
full of gratitude for to be here bombs all night we're going to drop bombs all night we're going
to have a great conversation we're going to dig into it but it it it is a fantastic energy space
but now that we've set that kind of understanding so people understand this beautiful place maybe
we'll talk a little bit about cannabis tourism at the end of the episode because I think it's part
of some a way that we can help develop and grow this community a lot more um there's some amazing
events being held and we'll touch on that a little bit at some point but I want to I want to there's
another foundation um that we need to lay a little bit so that people have a full understanding and
comprehending of exactly how we're talking and and it's referencing in our points of view um so
so processors are a very interesting license in Canada and and they situate you in a position
um that's interesting and different than most people would expect a lot some people are in
um you know locations where legalization is vertically integrated or or other points of
reference right but you're at a key point of really being in the sport driving and and
kind of develop and grow your community due to the way this licensing is set up um so can you
dig in a little bit to what exactly is a processing license in Canada um how do you get one and what
exactly is the responsibilities and where does it fall in kind of the I guess it would be the
the production chain of cannabis from from farms to to person who can feel
yeah so rolling back a few years ago I was uh hired to help uh local micro cultivators get
their license whether it was a nursery license processing license cultivation license and
I had an amazing opportunity to study the regulations and help with the license application
and it it was uh I learned a lot and I gained a lot of insight and knowledge I helped people
build business plans and when it came to a processing license I was very kind of uh concerned
around how challenging and restrictive it is for small craft growers and processing basically
processing license is is a license to package uh and produce cannabis and sell cannabis and
distribute it although it's a you have to get additional sales licenses and stuff but and it is
controlled and uh regulated by Health Canada and it's Health Canada um wants to see whatever
cannabis products get out into market to be safe and healthy for the end consumer uh processors
have a huge responsibility which is the liability to the consumer and so with that liability uh and
with the packaging uh there comes these additional uh costs to a processing license
and you have to have good quality management systems uh and good QAPs in place and you need
to be responsible for record keeping uh and storing cannabis and destroying cannabis and
all kinds of things so the processing license uh the the challenges that I saw with it was
for example helping micro license cultivators in this region you know start from the ground up
with their new micro facilities uh I was helping them get loans at the time um and helping them
build their plans and you know they were going into debt for you know anywhere between two and
five hundred thousand dollars easily or more and just to get up and operating and to build
their facility and a processing license or a micro processing license uh on addition to that
cultivation license um there's additional responsibilities that come with that and I saw
it as kind of a very difficult thing to do when you're just trying to get your micro cultivation
license up and seeing a lot of the different cultivators trying to get to market and working
with different processors and this is a couple of years ago it was very challenging and because
to build a processing facility it is millions of dollars even a micro processing license
attached to a micro cultivation license you still need to put the excise bond you have to
hire quality management uh personnel you need the understanding and experience on how to do proper
document control and how to report properly to Health Canada and CRA and so it is uh it's a very
challenging beast uh it takes a lot of capital and it also takes a lot of money just to kind of
float the boat before you start to receive money back from the liquid distribution branch or
whatever sales channels you have and it is the key to getting your product to market because
a processing license is the one that holds the contract with the liquor distribution boards
or now we're getting to see some changes with the direct retail but it is uh it's it's the key to
market and for that not to be accessible to small craft growers uh was something that I thought was
concerning and back in the day you know we would have buyers that was were responsible for this and
now we need to have you know all these kind of systems and accountability in place to you know
get it to market and I just think it's kind of unfair really and I'm coming more from you know
a cultural aspect for that to be in the hands of these big corporations that have no interest
in the community or the culture or the people who grow it and there's a huge disconnect for
that I saw in those years before Antidote was being built where a lot of those processors did
not understand craft cannabis they did not understand how to properly store it or handle it
and by the time it finally got to the shelves from these amazing craft growers that had this fresh
dank beautiful bud it wasn't what it was because it's like six months down the road and it went
through all these different environmental controls so anyways I'm going a little bit off
off topic but a processing facility is uh it's it's the key to market
okay we need to dig into that a little bit more because you were digging into a really fun area
is that processing light in that middle phone because like man I've heard of these people
getting processing licenses that are like hey we got this awesome processing license or even
even storage facility licenses where they'll transport and store your goods for you and go
and and and they're they're like do you I'm like do you have a fridge do you have a do you have a
walk-in is is your are you storing your flour and your extracts and your products in in freezers
like where where are you storing them and how are you storing them oh yeah we got a couple fridges
oh you like like stand up like you're not storing all the cannabis in fridges like it's not all
being frozen kept in a in like a like what the fuck do you mean it's being left in a in a in a
warm um warehouse like it doesn't make sense just absolutely backwards so can you talk about that
and a little bit like yeah you know what I mean the the challenges that are faced in that area
you might be muted
from a yeah I was shaking my head and pulling my hair out as I was listening to you speak because
I'm like yes exactly it uh a craft grower in this it is like so passionate about their product
and the environmental controls is everything from the moment you you know start your clone
start your clone to the curing process and there is not really one moment where you're not
you're not in you know taking care of the environment and and the temperature and the
humidity to take care of this beautiful product and all the love and the craft that goes into this
and all the energy and resources and work um like that's how you want the consumer to get your
product is like you all of that good knowledge and experience and all that that you put into it
and I just like you you know the I think that the government just obviously doesn't understand
cannabis production or distribution or anything and they just took you know looked at other
industries and said okay well we're gonna you know make turn it into you know this you know
supply chain and this is how it's going to get from here to there but you know cannabis is not
like alcohol and it is it's not it's it needs to be um properly controlled and you know and the
drying and curing is everything about what makes good weed weed you could grow a beautiful crop
and if you don't dry it and cure it properly it and store it properly it's crap by the time it
gets to person or it's moldy or like all kinds of things can go wrong with it so uh yeah you know
at Antidote we you know have uh we got the most amazing HVAC company that specializes in cannabis
cultivation in this region and we take great pride and care in our environmental controls
and that's something that we want to get the freshest cannabis uh into the consumer's hands
that we all feel proud about and that the cultivators themselves can feel proud about
so you know let's let's get into kind of the fun chat because we can go get a little
casual here and dig in because you're in a unique position working with multiple different farms
different industries different space you have a unique position to have a look at a lot of flower
and a lot of different stuff going on in the region um tell me a little bit about you know
what's growing what's trending what what are people what are people having success with
you know what what's going on in the kootenays when it comes to flower and and who are processors
that or or products that are you know that are at market or coming to market keep an eye out for
yeah uh as a cannabis connoisseur and nerd i love my job as far as like getting to see all
these different cultivators and their products coming out uh there's some great um products
on the market right now uh you'll see we all know chay uh from rosebud cannabis farms he
is growing an amazing cultivar which is his own personal uh genetic that he bred which is uh
sarah's secret which is uh it's just beautiful i have uh it's it's a very gassy uh i believe it
comes from the chem dog family and with hints of uh fruity flavors and it's it's just a super
solid cultivar that does really well in this region it barely needs to be pruned uh and it
just grows perfectly and the taste of it is is really beautiful uh and it's very special and
unique like i smoke a lot of cannabis but uh this particular one um kind of makes you feel like
just for a better word it makes you feel like you're in touch with god or something like it's
just like you get downloaded with all of this um you know kind of ethereal um messages and it's
very beautiful and it tastes great and i'm i'm a super huge fan of gas so uh i'm excited about that
uh kootenai's finest um is also just anything that comes out of kootenai's finest uh their
uh master grower sal is uh just everybody knows that he has uh an incredible seed collection when
i first got introduced to sal and uh went and met him he had a couple of tables out with his seed
collection and i just sat down and smoked wheat and you know and we just nerded out on like he had
all the seeds of all the bags of weed and everything all categorized and we i just almost lost my mind
um he's traveled the world he's been collecting seeds and he is like the biggest cannabis nerd
ever so anything that comes out of kootenai's finest is just super unique um and beautiful
um we also have uh the like new and upcoming uh cultivars there is uh
uh quantum is about to come out uh and they are also they have two master growers uh under their
house that again super amazing legacy people and they are they're going to be launching their own
um cultivar called dopamine which is a super high uh thc sativa uh so that i'm really excited to
quantum come out uh same thing like that's the thing it's like it's like going to a unicorn cup
every time you meet these people it's just like you know outcome the seeds outcome all the different
flavors and tastes and it's just kind of blow your mind out of this world uh there's others coming
around the bend as well we do help with licensing uh services so you know people who want to
transition into the legal market they call us up we do a gap assessment um and then we help them
from licensing to sales and and kind of hold their hand so uh there's a lot of people coming around
the corner another actually i can't i can't miss um uh crone's crone's nest uh old friend of mine
from way back in the east van days uh he is uh has a greenhouse uh out in the kind of salmo valley
and he's growing uh durban poison he's like all about uh growing uh land race and old strains
uh really wants to focus on being a very uh he really wants to focus on sativas uh in his
greenhouse and uh and hit the local market with some nice ounces so uh super excited about that
and uh we're also going to be doing pre-rolled joints and some hash so uh we're going to be
able to take a lot of these people's um cultivars and uh and you know infuse pre-rolled joints with
hash and do some really unique mix and matching uh that i don't think uh canada uh has seen in the
legal market yet. Hoot, hoot. I hopefully i'm coming through a little bit clearer uh but there it's
it's a beautiful space and i can't wait to see things develop and and change over the next
little while especially as as our market becomes more and more educated and deeper understanding of
the plant and you know interpreting it properly and so and so forth all the blah blah blah that
we're used to hearing about the challenges facing the industry in space now one of the things that
people don't often think about look at or analyze like how did dead transition fare
for the local space you know like if you have if you're going to transition from a
a federally illegal substance to a completely legal substance countrywide and you're going to
create systems and and and licensing and all these things in place to allow people to be able to
purchase or grow or or sell or whatever it happens to be for cannabis when you do these things um
ideally you want us to be gross development and change and unfortunately i hear that's not the
regular story there's there there aren't there isn't that growth and development and change
because a lot of these communities have actually been kind of pushed out of their own industry in
a way um so i i were and there's also often talk about you know predatory business tactics
you know like people being pushed to sign contracts to get lose their ip and and just
some really bullshit stuff and and oftentimes it's just it's just kind of fucked up so like
that means that how has the transition from leg legacy to legal fare for the the local community
and also how um and and what are some things or warning signs for people that are maybe in
the position of looking to go from legacy to legal um and and choosing to work or find a pair
or find a company that does something like what you do how how can you do this a safely okay
and and b how has the area spaced um in the last little while two very big complex questions
so yeah have fun well the transition here locally it is full of
complication and community futures which is an economic development agency focused on rural
development uh they are all over canada and they focus on building small to medium-sized businesses
and loans and they're again community futures they're very focused on you know world communities
and and kind of uh small businesses medium-sized businesses so i bring community features up because
the nelson community features applied for once they saw this happening they applied for a grant
to have a cannabis transition initiative in this region to provide the region with free resources
to help people transition so i was hired for that position with stacy johnston and the two of us
took that on for a two-year program and that was a very pivotal time for this region because
we were coming from more of community service based place and it was just it's just such a unique
thing so i guess like the environment of the kootenai region uh when it comes to you know
like economic development agencies to our local regional district to the chambers of commerce
to kootenai lake tourism to selkirk college like the environment around here is very pro cannabis
and and legalization of cannabis and and understands the impact uh the economic impact
the amount of jobs that are provided and how all this money spills into this region and we don't
face the same stigma as a lot of other regions it's just it's and i guess again back to what
makes this area so unique so the environment is really really ripe and juicy and beautiful for
you know people to transition into legal production however the access to uh information
for clear guidance uh uh guidance around the regulations what they mean how a micro license
is different from a standard license and how the regulations are different like it the to try to
figure that out on your own without like you know taking a course or or working with the right people
like it's it is it's like learning a whole new language it is just it's you know and it's not
that it can't be done it can totally be done but it's just kind of daunting and and it's it's
it's a challenge you know when health canada changed the regulations around the uh dairy
industry in the meat industry uh they changed the regulations to make it more restrictive for
small producers and at that time when health canada made changes the provincial government
invested into these programs to help assist farmers into understanding the regulations and how to
comply and i like it was years and years of a government grant to help people and that is what
is needed to successfully transition this region is the is clear guidance and services and resources
that aren't going to cost people an arm and a leg because they're already struggling with where
they're going to get their you know 200 to 500 000 to comply with health canada's regulations
for indoor i'm talking about there's it's so the transition is has you know that that
transition when that program was up and running we had about 50 clients and we successfully
licensed 13 people but there was many more that would have just loved to keep on using those
services but the missing piece in that was that people were having a hard time getting to market
so when you're looking at these leaders in the industry you know that are kind of sticking their
necks out and transitioning and trying to do their best to you know to move into the regulated market
and then you're finding that they can't get to market and they're they're struggling well then
you know nobody really wants to kind of you know follow suit it's you know it's
it's so complicated really you know it's i guess so that's kind of also why antidote started was
we lost the funding we we i couldn't just you know turn my back on all of these people that
helped get licensed they still needed guidance on on all kinds of questions around regulations
and compliance and so antidote kind of you know got breathed into being so we could carry on a
lot of those services so when so basically you know we have a really really affordable monthly
program where we just guide people through all of this and we help people you know where our aim
is is to simplify all this complicated mess so the transition is is happening but very very slowly
and the people who have uh you know the people that did take that on are now starting to do well
and you know they're now starting to think about building their second micro facility
and so it it's it's moving into a good direction uh but it is it's very difficult and i think that
one of the biggest difficult parts is just trying to get that capital and you know where
where do people find that money to make these regulatory changes so there's a lot of kind of
moving parts that lack lack of access to capital lack of access to clear guidance um
that has been kind of tricky the you mentioned something about uh is there like for people who
are wanting to transition if there's like any kind of warning or something i can do to you know
send some piece of advice i think it's um i think it's like
have a strong team and maybe it's just you and one other person but just have a like have somebody
that doesn't mind that kind of heavy administrative uh part and that can create
organizational security plans and good production plans and implement standard operating procedures
you know you don't need that person forever but definitely while you go through the license
application while you get your license having a really strong admin person to help you through
that uh is definitely my um piece of advice to do it successfully and also with like we try to
we don't just like you know take people's information um when we help people get their
license and just like you know create their uh osp and gpp report for them and say good luck
shake your hand and you're off we teach them we go through the license application with them
and we give them homework and we try to teach them so they learn to interpret these things for
themselves so they can create their business for themselves and it's totally possible i've seen
stacy take 100 page sops and turn it into 10 pages and that 100 page sop came from a
consulting agency that slapped an lp sop into a micro um and charged them you know 30 40 grand
and then they get their license and and they just don't really understand what they're doing
that's my biggest warning is understand what you're doing and take find people that can work
with you to teach you and simplify it all and take the complicated out of it because
it's complicated but it's not that complicated it's it's there's like just things like make sure
you have filters for your air so you don't get contaminated by outside things or make sure that
you know you have no exposed wood or your your cracks between your floor and your walls there's
nothing in like it's complicated but not that complicated and and it's just a lack of really
clear guidance and and people need to be trained just like the farmers needed to be trained when
the meat regulations change just like the farmers needed to be trained when the dairy industry
changed the difference here is that cannabis isn't decriminalized and so people look at it like
you know it's some some risk and you know for me i just don't get that and you know i come from
a region and a culture and a community of farmers and really lovely beautiful people that have a
passion for this plant that should have never been illegal in the first place and i if if we
could you know so because i see those things that's kind of what antidote is about as well
it's like i just want fairness i just want to see people i want to see a fair transition where we
take the stigma right out of this and we give people the tools to take this business and make
it their own and find that balance between being a legacy farmer and and having a healthy product
that you know that is good for people and it's all quite possible but that lack of information
the stigma those things are what is the biggest challenge awesome now dr anna i'm going to angle
something towards you here i'm wondering if you all not angle something or a more open-ended
uh ask you as is someone working in a newer um environment with you know legal with with
recreational and so i'm being legal a little bit you know not not quite as long term as it has been
here i know you've been in other areas of the united states that has the longer term um recreational
market but in the area that you are now understanding and hearing kind of the challenges that
are faced in a market that's that's developed over time what are do you have any question
comments or statements um in in reference to kind of what we've talked about tonight
and challenges i don't know stuff i got other questions but i thought i'd give give you a go
uh-oh i got dr anna bits and like a bathroom breaker in the fridge uh johnny same question
question comment statements and if you i am going to open this up now because we are getting close
to the end uh we are in the last third of the show and i'd like to open up the stage for everybody
to come up and and ask a question uh comment or make a statement um so we are doing that now
doing that now um but yeah i would love to hear from johnny if i could or dr anna whichever one
there you go johnny got it got to it first hey um no honestly this past year london you've been
kind of exposing me to this um this kind of the cannabis realm in canada um it's something that
it's so uh the cannabis culture down in northern california and the emerald triangle is really
really rich and i've never really uh been exposed to any of this until recently and hearing about
the kootenays it just sounds like such an amazing place and like if i was like in the you know 70s
or 60s and i was like or the 60s and i was being like drafted i almost guarantee i would have
ended up there and in hearing these stories and hearing about the rich cannabis culture up there
and just uh the overall vibe it's really this whole episode i was just thinking like you know
i gotta i gotta get up there i feel like i would really really like it a lot and that's just kind
of hammered at home further like just to see this rich vibrant cannabis community that in a lot of
ways it sounds like the uh has a lot of parallels with the emerald triangle um and and really um
you know it just it sounds like you know the whole the whole industry in canada it's um more mature
than it is in the united states um you know it's only on a state by state level here that it's
legal and in canada it's been you know legal throughout the whole country for i'm not sure
when when that happened but a minute now and so seeing the growing pains that canada went through
and seeing now kind of the dust settle it is um it's a nice reminder for for people and cultivators
in the united states and and specifically in these areas where they're just getting um you know really
disillusioned with the market and how things are playing out um because it just someone reminded me
that uh recently that you know canada had started off the whole scene up there started it looked
really bleak initially um it looked really bleak the cannabis uh you know legalization rollout it
was just favoring larger you know factory style grows of just you know rock wool you know just
no no love or heart and soul in it and it was just you know solely for money and and stocks were
being traded and it was just this new new way to to make a buck and now hearing that that whole
model is kind of um you know it's it's shrinking and it's it's definitely downsizing and it's
opening up this this realm and this possibility um for craft producers to come in people who are
really focused on quality and and not just that they're just overall good stewards to to the plant
in general and and it's just it really is a breath of fresh air to hear all of this so um i want to
thank you shannon for coming up and talking and thank you london for bringing all these these
amazing um people representing that region because it is a really special region in the world for
cannabis waiting for the cop car to drive by so it didn't just immediately go to sirens um
appreciate that i think i think it's been a fantastic conversation so let's talk about that
a little bit so um kootenays challenge has has has faced challenges been through some things
um has a passionate cannabis culture there um how do you see the kootenays develop as a
canna tourism space and this is like it's such a weird term to say but i kind of i love it so much
it's kind of tourism um the next frontier in cannabis culture um tell me a little bit about
how you see the kootenays developing and and moving forward in this modality people love to
come to the kootenays uh already for tourism which is really a lot to do with the ski culture
the outdoor culture and and so tourism is already a part of this region and you know you look at
like if you look at like craft breweries right now in the kootenay region i live in taslo a town of
1200 people a beautiful town the most beautiful town ever and we have the angry hen a small craft
brewery and it's just fantastic and people come to the angry hen and and it's a place for social
gathering i go every thursday to go and hang out with my crew of people that i've been friends
for for 20 years and i have you know one or two nice beers and and go home and it's just such a
it's like you go to nelson you got torchlight you go to nelson you have uh you know the other one
like it's happening everywhere but we need to also provide consumption spaces for cannabis users
because if there was a consumption place for cannabis i guarantee you that we would probably
move over there because we're we we like beer and i'll still you know i like to drink craft beer and
i'll consume a nice craft beer but you know most of my friends and i like to smoke weed and we'll
we'll choose that over a beer uh but i think that having consumption spaces so people can gather
is extremely important and you look at um look at the unicorn cup for example the unicorn cup
is a perfect example of what canna tourism can turn into like you look at uh like having events
where there's education educational speakers and a place to try different cannabis and it's
it draws people in i just went to uh i've been on a lot of journeys over this last six months
and i went to portugal for example i went and spoke at a conference in lisbon
and i did a 30 minute slide show and when i walked off everybody was like what the who are you guys
and there was like a lineup of people that were interested in in coming to this region because
they just had their minds blown and which had a lot to do with the cultivators i just
i really highlighted all the different genetics and all the cultivators and and told the story of
the people and especially in europe people are really interested in british columbia same as
the emerald triangle you know there's people from all over the world that are already know of our
our unique spots and regions and so providing you know the space for people to come
uh such as the unicorn cup or consumption lounge is it a lot lounge is definitely a key to making
this successful i would also love to see farmers markets or just cannabis being allowed to be at
a farmer's market just like alcohol you know you're allowed to take your craft brewery to
the local farmer's market that also would be a huge uh thing to for small farmers to because
again that's what people love like when you go to the farmer's market you want to know who grew
your food how it was grown where it was grown you want to meet the face of that person who grew your
food uh that is part of of craft and being a foodie and a wine and some you know people that just love
quality products so that is a another huge component the other huge component this is you
know making a small outdoor grows viable that is so critically important and again why i just really
you know again what drives antidote is the price you know if we can if if we can take
a you know a greenhouse grower that's growing a nice beautiful sativa plant and we can you know
turn put that into some affordable ounces and we can give that grower a dollar a gram
that person is now making 50 to 80 thousand dollars off of off of a small micro in the backyard
and with that now we can do some tours and we can say hey you know we got a grower over here
here's a map here's a map of all the growers in this region this is you know their hours of
operation where you can stop by and you can take a tour and you can see how it's grown you can ask
the questions oh my god like the other thing i was thinking and this is a little off topic but imagine
the you pick imagine you as a farmer you get all your nice tops and you you you process as much as
you can and all the stuff that's left over you have your local community come and just like
you know bag it up and weigh it and send it to a processor and then they send it and ship it to the
person there's the the and this is where outdoor farming is just so important and it's so important
for so many reasons but if we can make this a viable
market and and bring a good income to small farmers then we're going to have people that
are going to be coming to specifically to tour this kootenai region and you know hop on a e-bike
go down the rails to trails because almost every community has a trail system and stop off at farms
meet your farmer get to know people learn about the craft learn about that farmer go to the
farmer's market go to the consumption lounge that's how i see the future of this kootenai
of the kootenai region and you know and that's what drives me when i'm tired is that i can i can
just taste it and see it it's and you know we're right near the okanagan region uh and the okanagan
is uh known for growing uh its grapes and creating good wineries and people same thing people hop on
their e-bikes and they go from winery to winery but kootenai is about weed we always have been
and if and that is what attracts people here and this is also part of breaking barriers and stigma
is is uh you know meeting your local grower that local grower is probably growing potatoes and
tomatoes and and has a lot of yummy things to provide and and that i think is the future of
canada tourism in this region i also could see uh you know getting involved with some we've got
rocky mountain um college uh in creston and we've got selkirk college we have some uh the rocky
mountain one does have some bud tending courses so if we can you know link up some educational
aspects where people could come to the kootenai and learn and take a master growers program
and then be able to uh go and work with some of the master growers in this region and learn from
everybody i think that is also there's a little piece of gold right there awesome where'd he go
we had a we had somebody come coming up for a question or comment or statement they left
another guy uh but damon as another canadian on the panel if you're there for your questions thoughts
emotions if you're if you're available killing me guys ah a test
i gotta give someone else an opportunity to speak otherwise people get bored of me
damon's like messaging me i'm making ash again i'm here i'm here
yeah no i mean i'm really enjoying this conversation um i think i've wondered you
know i love these like meet the farmer events and um you know really getting back to the more craft
getting back to the more craft kind of um less manufacturing but more that scale where
you know you're operating a smaller scale you still have good practices and stuff and so
like i put in the chat earlier like they have kind of you know a lot of people who produce like
small amounts of food and sell at local grocery stores and stuff they don't necessarily have to
be like gmp certified they can go through like cottage licenses and stuff like that and then
also you can like when my husband and i we had a little fermented foods company we rented space
out of uh a kitchen a commercial kitchen and so then they kind of took care of a lot of the
risks and things like that and so i wonder if there would be opportunity for kind of alternative
models like that that could allow for and enhance these um small scale kind of tourism based and
then they can participate um you know but still minimize potential you know risks from maybe not
being at that manufacturing like high level like crazy stringency scale what are your thoughts about
those kind of alternative models that's exactly what we're kind of going for
uh and and yet you know i think if you come back to me in six months well i'll be at a different
place to properly properly answer that but that is exactly what we're going for we're looking at
creating antidotes similar to a food hub where we have the certified kitchen and we have you know
meet all of the compliance and regulatory things and have a safe handling and food grade place
but you can bring your recipes to us and we will create it for you and get it into the market for
you so that is actually kind of the goal is to look at all these you know whether you're someone
that makes chocolates or bath bombs or right now we have approximately um about so
i'm gonna say there's a rose buddies program so it kind of splits but we have approximately
eight micro cultivators that we are uh opening our doors uh with antidote to get them to market
and as we go through each one and get them to market uh we're going to help with the licensing
and then with that licensing we do have in-house expertise to build a business plan so if somebody
comes with to us and says i got this great idea this is what we want to do we will help them
create that and make sure that it's viable and then if it's viable our goal is to help them get
to market the the part that i'm still a bit unclear about because i'm not in the midst of
processing and going through all the regulatory aspects of uh of this is like i don't think people
can come into your processing facility and just do their recipe at this moment and that is just
kind of more i gotta dig into the regulations around that but there and i think there is always
a way around these things but you need to have the drive and the and and and you need to kind of
think outside the box and then you need to figure out how to comply with the regulations and all
those things are possible but that is definitely the goal of antidote is to be like similar to a
food hub and have all the equipment and the infrastructure available uh that people can
create these small batch uh products and get them to market now we have the direct to retail uh
starting so that's going to be a bit of a game changer it allows the retailers to have that
relationship with the growers again and have those conversations and i see moving into the future
with these new changes the getting the growers and the retailers together to have conversations
we're going to be able to meet the consumers needs and pivot a lot more agile and and
creatively so we can help these small uh producers to get to market that's really cool that's great
that you're giving them that avenue and since you've already been like kind of helping folks
get their businesses established you can also be a resource like you know i love the hub the hub idea
because it's also kind of an incubator because everybody like exchanges good practices and
information there and good collaboration stuff so i i think that's really cool
yeah i think that's where innovation happens too and again like collaboration there's so much magic
that happens this this you know competition is good in in a lot of ways and competition
keeps us accountable and makes us pivot and you know helps us be better better entrepreneurs and
better businesses but there's a balance there where when again back to the old legacy days
and the kootenays we thrived because of collaboration and we thrived because of
providing knowledge and experience and genetics and tips and it made everyone better around us
and that's how we developed our name and our kootenay brand is because of that innovation
creativity all these things come out of a collaboration between between people
brilliant and we are rounding about to the end of another fantastic evening of discussion here with
shannon ross antidote i'm you know i'm excited to see the development change over the next little
while you know we see farms coming to market that are micro facilities that are dropping products
and they're selling out and they're doing really really well and getting orders second orders like
right off the bat there's an amazing thing happening here and i look forward for it to
be changing quite a bit so we always like to end and round these conversations out at the very end
and since we always like to end at about an hour and a half and we're getting there
um shannon how can we support you and antidote in your cause where do we find you how do we
support you what can we do is there like hey if i'm canadian is there a farm that i can go
purchase product from like what can we do to support you and antidote as a community
i think you're doing it right now part of it is getting the message out to the world
so thank you lyndon for you know for bringing me here i really appreciate it and and it's it's the
platforms to get the message out is the is definitely the biggest thing that people can do
to help us uh spread our story and our message on on a more practical side if you know as from a
consumer you can keep going to the retailers and being like when is the you know where do i get
craft quality cannabis and put your put your money you know where your values are and sometimes less
is better if you are fortunate enough to you know if you're a medical patient that's another story
sometimes you need your medicine but and you need it at an affordable price so there's there's
all kinds of you know there's all kinds of everyone has their own unique circumstance but
focus on supporting uh small craft growers when you go to your retailers ask who the farmer is
try to you know understand what's behind the product and then just like you know when you
know are you gonna when i go and buy my clothes i'm gonna try to buy local as much as possible i'm
gonna you know invest into you know sustainable practices um you know we we really need like i
don't know i just again why antidote is a strong strong word and because we're at a very critical
time in this world and you i don't i don't need to go into it you just need to kind of
observe the world in the last few years especially around climate change uh and we need to make
serious uh investments into the things that we believe in and that is the most important thing
that we can do with every time we spend a dollar no matter what it is whether it's cannabis or
whether it's our shoes uh you know you know look for look for products that are sustainable and
are mindful of the impact and the more people start to uh consume less and be uh mindful of
what they consume i think that is uh the biggest impact that people can have you can find antidote
on the internet if you look up antidote processing.com you can get to our website it is
going to we are in the process right now of working with an amazing web designer uh liam wake and uh
is going to be radically changed in january um so but you can find us there for now you can reach
out uh we're very responsive you can contact us through there you'll find me on instagram under
miss infused uh and we will be getting into more social media but right now our focus is really on
uh building a really good website uh the funny thing about all of us is none of us are really
into social media so uh we're going to be switching into that but uh yeah it's uh you can also find us
at a lot of conferences and uh and then come to the unicorn cup i think that's another thing if
you come to the unicorn cup you're going to meet a lot of the growers and the community here in the
kootenays and uh that is uh if you can come to the unicorn cup that's a great way to support us
and also get to meet us and to learn about this region and to learn about all the new growers and
all the different products that are coming out brilliant well said and thank you so much for
