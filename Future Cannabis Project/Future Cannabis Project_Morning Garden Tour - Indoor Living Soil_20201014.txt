[00:00.000 --> 00:01.840]  A whole bunch of people waiting.
[00:02.840 --> 00:03.680]  Wonderful.
[00:05.280 --> 00:07.280]  Ba-dum-bum-bum.
[00:08.940 --> 00:10.900]  Are we live?
[00:12.160 --> 00:13.000]  Let's see.
[00:13.000 --> 00:14.040]  I'm on my screen.
[00:15.840 --> 00:16.800]  We are live.
[00:16.800 --> 00:18.260]  All right, hold on everyone.
[00:18.260 --> 00:19.920]  I'm trying some new stuff.
[00:26.500 --> 00:28.100]  Coolio, all right.
[00:28.100 --> 00:30.700]  Let me pop out the chat.
[00:30.700 --> 00:35.700]  And welcome to our Wednesday morning garden tour.
[00:35.940 --> 00:39.740]  And so under the,
[00:39.740 --> 00:42.380]  under underscore the can,
[00:42.380 --> 00:44.260]  or hold on, let me just put it in the chat.
[00:44.260 --> 00:45.860]  Under the canopy 420,
[00:45.860 --> 00:49.140]  for those of you who know him on Instagram,
[00:49.140 --> 00:53.380]  welcomemichael.com slash
[00:53.380 --> 00:58.380]  under underscore the underscore canopy 420, right?
[00:59.340 --> 01:00.700]  That's a mouthful, yeah.
[01:01.580 --> 01:02.900]  Okay, cool.
[01:02.900 --> 01:06.060]  So you basically,
[01:06.060 --> 01:11.060]  you're in flower now in one tent, right?
[01:12.620 --> 01:13.780]  Two tents.
[01:13.780 --> 01:14.620]  Oh, in two tents.
[01:14.620 --> 01:18.780]  So we gotta wait another 45 minutes or so for those,
[01:18.780 --> 01:23.780]  but you got another tent that's not in flower, right?
[01:24.440 --> 01:25.280]  Correct, yeah.
[01:25.640 --> 01:28.400]  Just put them from the root cubes into the beds
[01:28.400 --> 01:31.760]  just a couple of days ago, three or four days ago.
[01:32.900 --> 01:34.840]  So what, all right.
[01:34.840 --> 01:38.080]  So you're, let's get to know you a little bit.
[01:38.080 --> 01:40.380]  So you're in Michigan.
[01:40.380 --> 01:42.060]  You're growing at home.
[01:43.240 --> 01:47.520]  You look like you got some whiskers coming in.
[01:47.520 --> 01:49.140]  You're young though.
[01:49.140 --> 01:50.680]  Yeah, 28.
[01:50.680 --> 01:53.280]  Okay, you're just a baby.
[01:53.280 --> 01:55.200]  Yeah, young, but only been doing it.
[01:56.020 --> 01:57.080]  For like five years.
[01:57.080 --> 02:00.120]  Okay, and so you've been, all right.
[02:00.120 --> 02:03.960]  So you've been growing at home for five years, right?
[02:03.960 --> 02:08.040]  Yeah, so I was growing at my girl's dad's house
[02:08.040 --> 02:10.400]  because when I got out of the military,
[02:10.400 --> 02:12.140]  I'd smoked all before that, you know,
[02:12.140 --> 02:15.840]  but I got out and I can remember exactly where I was.
[02:15.840 --> 02:17.320]  I don't know what strain I was smoking,
[02:17.320 --> 02:19.520]  but my buddy pulled out a doobie
[02:19.520 --> 02:21.920]  and you know, I'm always like an anxious person
[02:21.920 --> 02:24.560]  and like always just like in that like part of the point,
[02:24.560 --> 02:27.160]  you know, and I smoked this doobie
[02:27.160 --> 02:29.400]  and by the time I got the second way around,
[02:29.400 --> 02:33.320]  I was just like, this is what cannabis can do for you,
[02:33.320 --> 02:34.680]  you know, and I was just blown away.
[02:34.680 --> 02:37.640]  And then when I got with my girl, her dad was growing
[02:37.640 --> 02:39.080]  and I was like, I gotta be a part of this.
[02:39.080 --> 02:42.260]  And that's, you know, how I got into it five years ago.
[02:43.840 --> 02:47.480]  I got back pay from a disability that I got
[02:47.480 --> 02:48.960]  that I went to him and I was like,
[02:48.960 --> 02:50.200]  hey, do you mind if I put some money in
[02:50.200 --> 02:52.040]  and build another flower room?
[02:52.040 --> 02:52.880]  He said, go ahead.
[02:52.880 --> 02:54.920]  So I did that from there, I pretty much took over
[02:54.920 --> 02:56.840]  and he just started like taking half the prop.
[02:56.840 --> 02:57.680]  So.
[02:58.800 --> 03:02.000]  That's the deal when you grow at someone else's house, right?
[03:02.000 --> 03:02.820]  Yeah, I did.
[03:02.820 --> 03:04.200]  You know, he's a super cool guy, you know,
[03:04.200 --> 03:05.960]  but there's just, you know,
[03:05.960 --> 03:07.880]  a few like he'll chop plants early.
[03:07.880 --> 03:10.160]  He'll like come down, oh, you should do this and that.
[03:10.160 --> 03:11.800]  And I'm like super non-confrontational.
[03:11.800 --> 03:14.240]  So I'm like, oh no, you know, like,
[03:14.240 --> 03:15.920]  but no, it's been fun, it's been cool.
[03:15.920 --> 03:19.760]  I just actually stopped a couple months ago.
[03:20.320 --> 03:21.720]  I told him, no, I can't do it anymore.
[03:21.720 --> 03:22.640]  I got my stuff at home.
[03:22.640 --> 03:24.240]  I'm just gonna run with that, so.
[03:26.240 --> 03:27.280]  So basically you're like,
[03:27.280 --> 03:29.080]  I'm no longer gonna grow weed at your house
[03:29.080 --> 03:30.760]  and give you half of what I grow?
[03:30.760 --> 03:32.720]  Yeah. Was he sad about that?
[03:32.720 --> 03:35.280]  Yeah, yeah, I still got my veggie garden there though.
[03:35.280 --> 03:36.800]  He's got, so it was cool.
[03:36.800 --> 03:40.400]  Like his block got split up after World War,
[03:40.400 --> 03:42.360]  or I'm sorry.
[03:42.360 --> 03:43.880]  Yeah, it was either during World War II,
[03:43.880 --> 03:45.640]  they split them up to be victory gardens
[03:45.640 --> 03:46.800]  or like right after or whatever.
[03:46.800 --> 03:48.880]  And so they got like big plots of land.
[03:48.920 --> 03:52.120]  They took like giant like farm fields
[03:52.120 --> 03:54.440]  and split them up into like residential areas.
[03:55.360 --> 03:57.400]  But they made that block like big like that
[03:57.400 --> 03:59.240]  so that the people could grow victory gardens.
[03:59.240 --> 04:03.200]  And so like, I can just plant the plants in the ground
[04:03.200 --> 04:06.680]  and they just grow like, it's awesome for a veggie garden.
[04:06.680 --> 04:09.840]  So at his place, you can grow outdoor?
[04:09.840 --> 04:10.920]  Yeah, yep.
[04:10.920 --> 04:14.000]  Okay, and is there any regulation thing?
[04:14.000 --> 04:17.600]  Like, is that legal or not legal or?
[04:17.600 --> 04:20.240]  It is, but there's a lot of gray areas.
[04:21.360 --> 04:24.000]  It can't be visible from like a public area.
[04:24.000 --> 04:27.280]  So he's got like an alley that runs in his back.
[04:27.280 --> 04:29.360]  So I would have to like, I don't know,
[04:29.360 --> 04:30.720]  like build something around the plant,
[04:30.720 --> 04:32.440]  put shade cloth so that no one could like
[04:32.440 --> 04:33.560]  technically see it and stuff.
[04:33.560 --> 04:35.920]  It's like the code people, they'll drive back there too.
[04:35.920 --> 04:38.240]  And just really, if someone wants to be a dick,
[04:38.240 --> 04:41.360]  like I grew one right behind the garage back there.
[04:41.360 --> 04:43.440]  It was huge, you know, and nobody said anything,
[04:43.440 --> 04:44.280]  nobody stole it.
[04:44.280 --> 04:47.240]  But again, the old man, he, oh,
[04:47.240 --> 04:49.040]  he didn't care if you got to chop it down,
[04:49.040 --> 04:50.160]  you know, someone's going to steal it.
[04:50.160 --> 04:53.000]  So he cut it like two weeks, three weeks early,
[04:53.000 --> 04:53.840]  shit like that.
[04:53.840 --> 04:56.800]  So if I do it outdoor, I want to wait
[04:56.800 --> 04:59.480]  till I get my own property and have enough, you know.
[05:00.440 --> 05:04.800]  But yeah, he just became too much for me.
[05:04.800 --> 05:08.000]  And you see that has, what's the,
[05:08.000 --> 05:10.200]  so for, I mean, you're growing indoors,
[05:10.200 --> 05:12.240]  but for people growing outdoors right now,
[05:12.560 --> 05:17.200]  what's the weather like as they're in harvest?
[05:17.200 --> 05:18.640]  It's really like weird.
[05:18.640 --> 05:21.880]  So I'm in lower Michigan, about 15 minutes south of Detroit.
[05:22.760 --> 05:25.600]  And we got a frost, did we get a frost?
[05:25.600 --> 05:28.680]  I don't know, it got really cold like a week ago.
[05:28.680 --> 05:31.680]  And then now this whole week we've been in the upper 60s,
[05:31.680 --> 05:35.080]  low 70s and, but that's something I actually wanted
[05:35.080 --> 05:36.440]  to touch on about indoor too,
[05:36.440 --> 05:38.720]  because the temperature is changing outside.
[05:38.720 --> 05:41.880]  So my thermostats being finicky inside
[05:42.520 --> 05:44.320]  and I have like dumps in this room,
[05:44.320 --> 05:45.960]  cause like my tents are all enclosed
[05:45.960 --> 05:48.440]  in this one little like washroom, you know.
[05:48.440 --> 05:51.040]  So I find it better to control the temperature
[05:51.040 --> 05:52.520]  like of the main room,
[05:52.520 --> 05:54.440]  but that's being affected by the outdoor temps.
[05:54.440 --> 05:57.400]  So when the temps drop, like my AC is not running so much.
[05:57.400 --> 05:59.760]  So I have to leave the door open to the room
[05:59.760 --> 06:01.600]  so that it'll cool the whole room
[06:01.600 --> 06:02.600]  and in turn cool the tents,
[06:02.600 --> 06:04.520]  cause you know, it tends to start touching 85
[06:04.520 --> 06:05.520]  and stuff like that.
[06:06.600 --> 06:08.560]  But yeah, no, outdoors, it's still good.
[06:08.560 --> 06:10.040]  I know the people in Northern Michigan,
[06:10.080 --> 06:12.280]  they're starting to chop their stuff.
[06:12.280 --> 06:14.760]  Rascal Farmer is who I follow for that stuff.
[06:14.760 --> 06:15.680]  He's in up in Michigan.
[06:15.680 --> 06:17.760]  He's a really, really cool dude.
[06:17.760 --> 06:19.120]  He's grown some months and then stuff,
[06:19.120 --> 06:21.520]  but he showed his plants with a like heart,
[06:21.520 --> 06:23.640]  like the second hard frost on them.
[06:23.640 --> 06:26.560]  But he knew after that there was gonna be a week of 60.
[06:26.560 --> 06:28.400]  So he left them going.
[06:28.400 --> 06:31.760]  So it's coming to the end around here,
[06:31.760 --> 06:34.040]  but I think we've still got another like week or two
[06:34.040 --> 06:36.480]  of some like nice weather in Northern Michigan.
[06:37.480 --> 06:42.480]  Yeah, I'm just posting his Instagram.
[06:43.320 --> 06:45.240]  Oh yeah, he's not one of the first guys I got
[06:45.240 --> 06:47.680]  like five years ago when I switched from
[06:47.680 --> 06:51.720]  chem growing to organic and yeah, he was one of the guys,
[06:51.720 --> 06:53.840]  but he fell off, but he's not getting back.
[06:53.840 --> 06:55.600]  Well, so actually talk about that.
[06:55.600 --> 06:57.920]  Cause you said you started growing
[06:57.920 --> 06:59.840]  at your father-in-law's place
[06:59.840 --> 07:02.960]  and that was outdoor in the soil,
[07:02.960 --> 07:04.760]  but then you just said chem growing.
[07:05.360 --> 07:06.880]  So do you mean like hydro?
[07:06.880 --> 07:08.880]  Were you growing hydro when you first set up
[07:08.880 --> 07:11.680]  your basement grow?
[07:11.680 --> 07:12.520]  Yeah, the indoor.
[07:12.520 --> 07:14.240]  So the outdoor was nothing like big,
[07:14.240 --> 07:16.000]  it was just like, oh, let's do a plant type thing.
[07:16.000 --> 07:18.600]  But so the indoor I start,
[07:18.600 --> 07:21.560]  cause I was once I like, what the weed just,
[07:21.560 --> 07:23.560]  when I smoked it and it helped me with that anxiety,
[07:23.560 --> 07:24.480]  it blew my mind.
[07:24.480 --> 07:26.400]  Cause I'd smoked all through high school
[07:26.400 --> 07:30.040]  being like that punk kid, like just wanting to get high.
[07:30.040 --> 07:32.120]  And, but lying to my mom when she caught me like,
[07:32.120 --> 07:33.160]  oh, it helps me eat.
[07:33.160 --> 07:35.440]  Cause I knew that was like the anecdotal evidence
[07:35.440 --> 07:36.920]  and stuff, you know?
[07:36.920 --> 07:38.600]  So then when I got older and got out,
[07:38.600 --> 07:40.960]  I was like, yeah, I can't wait to smoke,
[07:40.960 --> 07:43.160]  smoke with my buddies and just like,
[07:43.160 --> 07:46.080]  totally, totally changed my view on it.
[07:46.080 --> 07:50.240]  And so the people like my one buddy was already growing,
[07:50.240 --> 07:51.880]  but he was working at the grow store.
[07:51.880 --> 07:53.440]  So he got me a job there.
[07:53.440 --> 07:55.520]  So the people that took me under their wing
[07:55.520 --> 07:58.040]  were chem growers in the beginning.
[07:58.040 --> 07:59.760]  So I started growing with mills.
[07:59.760 --> 08:02.240]  And, was that-
[08:02.240 --> 08:03.680]  Did it pay the bills?
[08:03.680 --> 08:04.520]  Yeah.
[08:04.520 --> 08:05.400]  Yeah. You know?
[08:05.400 --> 08:09.320]  And, what, oh yeah, it was,
[08:09.320 --> 08:11.160]  I actually just made a post about it.
[08:12.680 --> 08:15.000]  It was, I'd been working there for maybe a year,
[08:15.000 --> 08:17.080]  been growing with the mills for a year,
[08:17.080 --> 08:19.760]  maybe like a couple of crops.
[08:19.760 --> 08:20.960]  And I was having fun, excited.
[08:20.960 --> 08:23.000]  And then this, this dude,
[08:23.000 --> 08:25.600]  this white dude with dreads walks in the grow store.
[08:26.640 --> 08:29.520]  And up to this point, like anytime anyone walked in,
[08:30.280 --> 08:31.960]  I would listen to him and my boss, he'd be like,
[08:31.960 --> 08:33.680]  dude, not everybody knows what the fuck
[08:33.680 --> 08:35.520]  they're talking about.
[08:35.520 --> 08:38.160]  Like sometimes you got to tune that shit out.
[08:38.160 --> 08:41.440]  And, so this guy comes in, he's talking about like,
[08:42.800 --> 08:44.000]  chem trails and that weird stuff.
[08:44.000 --> 08:46.240]  But then he's like talking about fungi
[08:46.240 --> 08:47.080]  that can feed your plant.
[08:47.080 --> 08:48.720]  At the time I had no idea.
[08:48.720 --> 08:50.360]  And I'm like, what the fuck?
[08:50.360 --> 08:52.080]  You know, he walks out and I walk up to my boss
[08:52.080 --> 08:54.760]  and I'm like, I get a load of that guy.
[08:54.760 --> 08:56.720]  You know, like, what the hell is he talking about?
[08:56.720 --> 08:58.240]  And he's like, no, he's right.
[08:58.280 --> 08:59.760]  And I was like, what?
[08:59.760 --> 09:01.920]  Just totally shattered my universe.
[09:01.920 --> 09:05.480]  Like the next day I got the teaming with Mike Rowe's book
[09:05.480 --> 09:08.600]  and stuff, and then it's just game set match.
[09:08.600 --> 09:11.200]  It's just a nonstop learning experience.
[09:11.200 --> 09:13.840]  Okay. But, but talk about the transition.
[09:13.840 --> 09:18.360]  So this is six, five years ago.
[09:18.360 --> 09:19.400]  Five, yep.
[09:19.400 --> 09:20.920]  Okay. So five years ago,
[09:20.920 --> 09:25.920]  you're growing in this same basement with Mills Hydro.
[09:26.120 --> 09:29.400]  What are kind of like, like you finished that,
[09:29.400 --> 09:32.160]  you obviously didn't like, you know, rip those plants out.
[09:32.160 --> 09:33.760]  So you finished that harvest.
[09:33.760 --> 09:37.360]  And then what did you set up next?
[09:37.360 --> 09:40.040]  Like, was it the raised beds or did you start in pots?
[09:40.040 --> 09:43.400]  Was it like with like whatever soil?
[09:43.400 --> 09:46.480]  Sorry, did you say you were working at the Hydro store?
[09:46.480 --> 09:47.400]  Yes. Yes.
[09:47.400 --> 09:48.240]  Ah, got it.
[09:48.240 --> 09:49.080]  Okay. All right.
[09:49.080 --> 09:50.920]  So you're in the middle of the scene.
[09:50.920 --> 09:54.240]  Okay. And what Hydro store is it?
[09:54.240 --> 09:56.080]  It's a Downriver Hydro.
[09:56.080 --> 09:57.000]  Okay. I don't work there anymore.
[09:57.000 --> 09:58.880]  I worked there like five years ago, four years ago.
[09:58.880 --> 09:59.720]  Got it. Got it.
[09:59.720 --> 10:01.320]  Okay. So, so now you're like,
[10:01.320 --> 10:03.240]  I want to try something different.
[10:03.240 --> 10:05.240]  What's kind of like the...
[10:07.400 --> 10:10.400]  So it was that, that guy walking in the grow store
[10:10.400 --> 10:11.520]  and telling me that.
[10:11.520 --> 10:13.040]  And so I was still in the basement
[10:13.040 --> 10:14.840]  at my girlfriend's dad's house,
[10:14.840 --> 10:16.560]  growing with the chemicals at the time.
[10:16.560 --> 10:17.920]  I just got in this house that I'm in
[10:17.920 --> 10:18.880]  like a year and a half ago.
[10:18.880 --> 10:21.120]  So that's how long I've been growing in the tents for.
[10:21.120 --> 10:25.000]  But, so yeah, it was that, that dread head walking in
[10:25.000 --> 10:27.520]  and saying that stuff that sent me down the path.
[10:27.520 --> 10:31.320]  So at the time I was in the middle of a grow with Mills
[10:31.320 --> 10:33.640]  and it just like bothered me so much.
[10:33.640 --> 10:35.480]  Like once I found out like how the chemicals
[10:35.480 --> 10:37.880]  like disassociate the microbes from the plant
[10:37.880 --> 10:38.720]  and stuff like that.
[10:38.720 --> 10:45.060]  And like, I bought, what's that line?
[10:46.660 --> 10:47.900]  Bio-Biz.
[10:47.900 --> 10:50.100]  Cause I was like, I can't do it.
[10:50.180 --> 10:53.140]  Like I can't know this and keep like,
[10:53.140 --> 10:55.460]  even the runoff and the chemicals going into the,
[10:55.460 --> 10:57.980]  like I can't, so I just, I switched it.
[10:59.020 --> 11:02.340]  And that kind of, it didn't really like work out that well
[11:02.340 --> 11:04.580]  with the switch, but then I ran Bio-Biz,
[11:04.580 --> 11:07.700]  the organic nutrients in that basement over there
[11:07.700 --> 11:09.820]  for a little while until I found out about,
[11:09.820 --> 11:11.940]  super soil and stuff.
[11:11.940 --> 11:15.100]  And then, so when I made the switch to living soil,
[11:15.100 --> 11:17.460]  it was, I was using Coots's Mix
[11:17.620 --> 11:22.620]  and I whipped up, I think two batches.
[11:23.580 --> 11:26.140]  And at the time, like I didn't know about recycling soil
[11:26.140 --> 11:26.980]  and all that stuff.
[11:26.980 --> 11:27.940]  So I was whipping up these batches
[11:27.940 --> 11:29.340]  and just dumping it outside,
[11:29.340 --> 11:31.780]  you know, like when I got done with it and stuff.
[11:33.380 --> 11:35.500]  But yeah, honestly, it was that dude walking
[11:35.500 --> 11:37.820]  in the growth store and just talking about that,
[11:37.820 --> 11:39.700]  that just sparked something, you know,
[11:39.700 --> 11:41.020]  and I got the book and then,
[11:41.020 --> 11:42.700]  and from there I just dropped chemicals
[11:42.700 --> 11:46.860]  like almost immediately and went to Bio-Biz for a run.
[11:47.300 --> 11:50.060]  And then I didn't even like run out of my Bio-Biz nutrients.
[11:50.060 --> 11:53.100]  I gave them to a buddy and when I switched, you know,
[11:53.100 --> 11:54.660]  and from there it's just been all living soil,
[11:54.660 --> 11:56.540]  all microbes, you know.
[11:56.540 --> 11:59.420]  So first, just quickly, can you still hear me?
[11:59.420 --> 12:01.460]  Yeah, but you're a lot softer.
[12:01.460 --> 12:04.660]  Okay, now I just changed, check, check, check.
[12:04.660 --> 12:05.700]  Can you hear that?
[12:05.700 --> 12:06.900]  Yeah.
[12:06.900 --> 12:08.100]  Is that louder?
[12:08.100 --> 12:09.060]  Yeah.
[12:09.060 --> 12:10.700]  And then softer?
[12:10.700 --> 12:11.540]  Yeah.
[12:11.540 --> 12:12.380]  Okay, all right.
[12:12.380 --> 12:13.860]  So I just switched mics.
[12:13.980 --> 12:18.780]  I'm winging it here with the stream yard,
[12:18.780 --> 12:23.780]  but so, all right, so, but was this in pots?
[12:25.420 --> 12:28.740]  Yes, they were in plastic pots when I was using the,
[12:28.740 --> 12:31.740]  when I started making the super soil and stuff.
[12:31.740 --> 12:32.780]  And it was all just learning.
[12:32.780 --> 12:35.140]  It was all just like, you know, keeping an open mind,
[12:35.140 --> 12:36.540]  and then you find out about the fabric pots,
[12:36.540 --> 12:38.300]  you gotta let the soil do, oh, that makes sense.
[12:38.300 --> 12:41.100]  And then, you know, you just change with when you learn.
[12:41.940 --> 12:44.580]  When did I get into the grassroots?
[12:46.900 --> 12:51.900]  I got a bed for my outdoor veggie garden,
[12:51.940 --> 12:53.340]  like three years ago,
[12:53.340 --> 12:54.620]  and that's probably when I got into them.
[12:54.620 --> 12:57.060]  And then I got the four by four bed
[12:58.220 --> 12:59.340]  that I have a couple posts on,
[12:59.340 --> 13:01.380]  but that's still in the basement over there
[13:01.380 --> 13:03.100]  at my father-in-law's house.
[13:05.820 --> 13:06.900]  But since I'm done there, you know,
[13:06.900 --> 13:08.860]  I'm probably just gonna keep a light over that
[13:08.860 --> 13:10.540]  and let him, you know, use that bed and stuff,
[13:10.980 --> 13:12.140]  because I don't wanna like tear that soil out
[13:12.140 --> 13:13.700]  and do all that, you know, but.
[13:15.700 --> 13:19.340]  And then, yeah, then I was just running fabric pots
[13:19.340 --> 13:23.020]  until I got over here and I knew about grassroots.
[13:23.020 --> 13:24.820]  I knew if I was gonna do like,
[13:24.820 --> 13:27.500]  this is all like for a bigger thing for me.
[13:27.500 --> 13:29.980]  I plan on doing something like a little bigger, you know,
[13:29.980 --> 13:34.980]  and, but yeah, the grassroots with the living soil line
[13:35.500 --> 13:36.900]  is the way to go for sure.
[13:36.900 --> 13:38.180]  So that's what I got for these,
[13:38.180 --> 13:40.420]  once I came over here to my tents,
[13:40.420 --> 13:42.300]  that's what I ran with.
[13:42.300 --> 13:44.580]  But, all right, and what,
[13:44.580 --> 13:46.940]  you said that was about a year and a half ago
[13:46.940 --> 13:51.940]  that you started in the raised beds rather than,
[13:52.180 --> 13:53.300]  so you're doing soil.
[13:53.300 --> 13:56.020]  So what were kind of some of the first things
[13:56.020 --> 13:58.900]  you started learning when you were playing with the soil?
[14:02.940 --> 14:06.540]  Like anything from like, I grew the same genetics
[14:06.540 --> 14:10.020]  and like something different happened, you know.
[14:10.020 --> 14:15.020]  Oh, probably the, yeah, the sound of the taste for sure.
[14:15.020 --> 14:17.780]  Like, cause everyone I know grows chemically,
[14:17.780 --> 14:21.140]  everyone I know, there's like maybe one other dude
[14:21.140 --> 14:22.740]  that, but he's like half and half, you know?
[14:22.740 --> 14:24.460]  So, but it's hard, you know?
[14:24.460 --> 14:26.820]  And so everything else, I was like, if I run out of weed,
[14:26.820 --> 14:28.500]  I gotta deal with the chem shit.
[14:28.500 --> 14:31.260]  Like I don't have anyone around here, you know?
[14:31.260 --> 14:33.820]  And so that was the first thing, man,
[14:33.820 --> 14:35.060]  like from smoking mice.
[14:35.940 --> 14:37.700]  At first I wouldn't even say anything
[14:37.700 --> 14:40.220]  cause I'm thinking, oh, maybe it's just me, you know?
[14:40.220 --> 14:41.460]  But no, time and time again,
[14:41.460 --> 14:43.780]  it's like, I can open a bag of chem stuff,
[14:43.780 --> 14:45.980]  like look at it, tell it's chem, smell it.
[14:45.980 --> 14:47.500]  Cause I worked in a grow store.
[14:48.460 --> 14:51.900]  It's insane how much that smells like a grow store.
[14:51.900 --> 14:54.740]  Like when you stick your nose in a bag of chem weed,
[14:54.740 --> 14:57.300]  like, yeah, you'll get the hints
[14:57.300 --> 14:58.620]  and the tones of the turps and shit,
[14:58.620 --> 15:02.460]  but like just that overwhelming like chem smell.
[15:02.500 --> 15:04.860]  And like, not from like poopy growers either,
[15:04.860 --> 15:07.940]  you know, like from big growers.
[15:07.940 --> 15:10.060]  And so that was probably the first thing
[15:10.060 --> 15:11.460]  was the taste and the smell.
[15:13.020 --> 15:15.220]  I did notice like my yields go down a little bit,
[15:15.220 --> 15:17.740]  but that's just from like, you know,
[15:17.740 --> 15:20.060]  my yields weren't good when I was growing first
[15:20.060 --> 15:22.300]  with chemicals either, like there's a learning curve,
[15:22.300 --> 15:23.140]  you know?
[15:23.140 --> 15:24.540]  Now I'm kind of getting there.
[15:26.900 --> 15:29.460]  And then the microbes, like the microbes
[15:29.460 --> 15:31.420]  are what blew my mind.
[15:31.580 --> 15:33.500]  Cause you go from like, basically an inert,
[15:33.500 --> 15:35.300]  like I was doing inoculants with my chemicals,
[15:35.300 --> 15:38.820]  but that's just so like counter productive.
[15:38.820 --> 15:41.140]  It's ridiculous.
[15:41.140 --> 15:42.780]  Like wasting your money on inoculants
[15:42.780 --> 15:44.060]  cause you got to use them once a week
[15:44.060 --> 15:45.620]  cause you just, whatever.
[15:45.620 --> 15:46.740]  But.
[15:46.740 --> 15:49.180]  Like you were using like mammoth type stuff
[15:49.180 --> 15:50.380]  or what were you using?
[15:50.380 --> 15:53.260]  Oh, once I found out like that basically,
[15:53.260 --> 15:54.780]  and the more I find out,
[15:54.780 --> 15:57.220]  the more it's like cemented in like all microbes.
[15:57.220 --> 15:58.940]  So I'm like obsessed with them.
[15:58.940 --> 16:00.860]  So anytime I go in the grow store,
[16:01.300 --> 16:02.260]  it's just like to get one thing,
[16:02.260 --> 16:04.020]  but I ended up leaving with a bottle of like
[16:04.020 --> 16:06.740]  some microbes or something just to like play around with,
[16:06.740 --> 16:07.660]  mess around with.
[16:11.180 --> 16:12.020]  Yeah.
[16:13.260 --> 16:14.380]  What else was I using?
[16:14.380 --> 16:16.180]  Mycos, azos,
[16:17.100 --> 16:19.580]  and pretty much anything I could get my hands on.
[16:19.580 --> 16:21.460]  And now there's a lot more products, you know?
[16:21.460 --> 16:26.460]  And yeah, so the smells, the microbes,
[16:26.780 --> 16:28.540]  the taste was the first thing I noticed.
[16:28.540 --> 16:29.980]  It was like pretty immediate.
[16:31.620 --> 16:35.460]  We have Providence, providing dong in the house.
[16:36.380 --> 16:41.100]  Sorry, I was just in Narragansett, Rhode Island two weeks.
[16:42.300 --> 16:43.140]  Whoops.
[16:46.910 --> 16:49.750]  I am having fun being able to throw comments
[16:49.750 --> 16:52.310]  up on the screen, but okay.
[16:52.310 --> 16:55.990]  So a year and a half ago, you moved to the raised beds
[16:57.390 --> 17:01.230]  and it's basically a one third, one third,
[17:01.230 --> 17:02.590]  one third coots.
[17:04.110 --> 17:07.550]  So can you talk about like where you were sourcing
[17:07.550 --> 17:09.470]  kind of like what's in there
[17:09.470 --> 17:11.590]  and then where are you sourcing it from?
[17:11.590 --> 17:14.990]  So the coots mix was at the other spot
[17:14.990 --> 17:19.070]  in my dad-in-law's basement in the plastic pots.
[17:19.070 --> 17:21.830]  And then when I got here a year and a half ago,
[17:21.830 --> 17:24.630]  that's when I only mixed up, let's see,
[17:26.310 --> 17:28.110]  like a couple batches of the super soil.
[17:28.110 --> 17:31.230]  And then after that, there was a local company,
[17:31.230 --> 17:33.230]  THC, Total Harvest Control,
[17:33.230 --> 17:36.910]  that makes a pre-bagged super soil that I started using.
[17:36.910 --> 17:38.790]  But I found that to be like too,
[17:39.750 --> 17:41.270]  it doesn't have like enough aeration.
[17:41.270 --> 17:45.670]  It kind of forms like a compaction layer at the top.
[17:45.670 --> 17:47.350]  I didn't like it, but now I'm using
[17:47.350 --> 17:49.510]  the Coastal Maine Stonington blend.
[17:49.510 --> 17:51.630]  That's what I have all in these beds with,
[17:52.790 --> 17:53.990]  what else did I put in there?
[17:53.990 --> 17:55.390]  Rice holes for sure.
[17:56.390 --> 17:58.190]  I didn't like that it had perlite.
[17:58.190 --> 18:00.990]  So that was for the aeration or what were the?
[18:02.190 --> 18:07.190]  Yeah, so the THC, let's see,
[18:07.190 --> 18:08.750]  I can't remember all the stuff that was in it,
[18:08.750 --> 18:10.830]  but they use the rice holes for aeration.
[18:10.830 --> 18:13.070]  That's what I like because all the other ones use perlite
[18:13.070 --> 18:16.390]  and I don't like perlite, but the compaction
[18:17.150 --> 18:20.310]  and basically just the compaction really, man,
[18:20.310 --> 18:21.670]  it just really bothered me.
[18:22.830 --> 18:25.350]  And I can tell some of the plants didn't really like it.
[18:25.870 --> 18:27.630]  But with the Stonington blend, it's super light.
[18:27.630 --> 18:30.030]  The only thing I don't like is the perlite in it,
[18:31.190 --> 18:33.070]  but it seems to do a lot better than that.
[18:33.070 --> 18:35.910]  For environmental reasons or for what reasons?
[18:36.830 --> 18:38.390]  What was that?
[18:38.390 --> 18:40.030]  That you don't like the perlite.
[18:41.030 --> 18:43.750]  Yeah, so when you water it tends to come to the top
[18:43.750 --> 18:48.750]  and then it gets in the environment and shit, it's all bad.
[18:49.590 --> 18:50.430]  Yeah.
[18:56.430 --> 19:00.190]  Yeah, I agree with that farmer view, 100%.
[19:00.190 --> 19:02.190]  And then here is a question.
[19:04.150 --> 19:04.990]  Yes.
[19:06.390 --> 19:07.230]  Yeah, that's true.
[19:07.230 --> 19:10.590]  That is gonna be my comment is what do you do
[19:10.590 --> 19:15.590]  to keep the aeration once they start to break down?
[19:16.350 --> 19:18.350]  Yeah, that's a good question.
[19:18.350 --> 19:19.990]  I don't really know besides like,
[19:20.510 --> 19:22.070]  if you don't wanna like till up your soil,
[19:22.070 --> 19:23.470]  cause I was thinking you could like top dress
[19:23.470 --> 19:24.870]  more rice holes.
[19:24.870 --> 19:25.790]  But yeah, they do break down,
[19:25.790 --> 19:27.670]  but I know they take a long time.
[19:27.670 --> 19:32.630]  And I ran like two cycles in the same soil.
[19:32.630 --> 19:34.430]  And when I got done, I took the pot outside
[19:34.430 --> 19:36.470]  with the THC and the rice holes in it,
[19:36.470 --> 19:38.310]  the total hardness control.
[19:38.310 --> 19:40.310]  And I ripped the pot off.
[19:40.310 --> 19:42.910]  And cause I had read that like the rice holes
[19:42.910 --> 19:47.910]  are like a micro cut, like a hub for microbes.
[19:48.150 --> 19:51.870]  So when I broke it up, dude, like you can see mycelium
[19:51.870 --> 19:55.630]  leaping off of the rice holes, like each end of like,
[19:55.630 --> 19:57.910]  you can just tell like the way they were held together
[19:57.910 --> 19:58.830]  and it was just amazing.
[19:58.830 --> 20:00.910]  Like it was hubs for microbes.
[20:00.910 --> 20:03.110]  So that's what I really loved about it.
[20:03.110 --> 20:04.750]  But yeah, once they break down, I don't know.
[20:04.750 --> 20:06.390]  And I don't know how long they take to break down.
[20:06.390 --> 20:08.790]  I don't know if it's like years or what.
[20:08.790 --> 20:10.790]  That's a good thing to think about.
[20:10.790 --> 20:12.710]  So this gets to my next question,
[20:12.710 --> 20:16.350]  which was in your basement raised beds,
[20:16.350 --> 20:17.710]  you have some worms.
[20:18.470 --> 20:20.430]  Oh yeah, absolutely, absolutely.
[20:20.430 --> 20:24.430]  Okay, can you show the ones that aren't in flower?
[20:24.430 --> 20:26.350]  Can you show us those beds?
[20:26.350 --> 20:27.190]  Yeah.
[20:27.190 --> 20:30.070]  Four or 10 feet to your left.
[20:30.070 --> 20:30.910]  Oops.
[20:36.470 --> 20:39.030]  I can't flip the screen around.
[20:40.630 --> 20:41.470]  Oh really?
[20:45.960 --> 20:47.720]  Yeah, I don't think so.
[20:47.720 --> 20:49.720]  I can't tell where I'm looking at, but.
[20:52.000 --> 20:52.840]  Yeah.
[20:54.880 --> 20:55.840]  Yeah, that's a,
[20:58.680 --> 21:01.040]  can't beat the blue mass with the blue soap.
[21:01.040 --> 21:01.880]  It's just.
[21:04.760 --> 21:07.240]  So I'm actually, I need to set something up
[21:07.240 --> 21:10.520]  with Michael Box from a sustainable village
[21:10.520 --> 21:13.240]  cause we're gonna do a demo of setting that stuff up.
[21:13.240 --> 21:18.240]  So do you have their water meter?
[21:19.040 --> 21:19.880]  No, I use.
[21:19.880 --> 21:21.120]  Or moisture meter?
[21:21.120 --> 21:24.200]  No, I use the blue lab pulse meter
[21:24.200 --> 21:27.520]  only because I have so many individual beds
[21:27.520 --> 21:30.400]  that I would need to buy 10 of them
[21:30.400 --> 21:31.640]  if I wanted to do it the right way
[21:31.640 --> 21:33.400]  and leave them in the bed, you know?
[21:36.160 --> 21:37.560]  So I just use the blue lab.
[21:37.560 --> 21:38.880]  It's pretty good.
[21:38.880 --> 21:39.880]  It can be finicky,
[21:39.880 --> 21:41.120]  but I found if you're not connected
[21:41.120 --> 21:42.440]  to anything else on Bluetooth,
[21:42.440 --> 21:46.880]  the blue lab volcanic rock.
[21:46.880 --> 21:47.720]  Yep, yep.
[21:48.160 --> 21:49.720]  I promise, yeah, that's something.
[21:49.720 --> 21:50.760]  Do rice holes.
[21:50.760 --> 21:53.800]  Yeah, so where did you get your,
[21:53.800 --> 21:56.480]  where'd you source the rice holes?
[21:56.480 --> 21:58.560]  From the grocery store, Downriver Hydro.
[21:58.560 --> 21:59.520]  Okay.
[21:59.520 --> 22:00.960]  So even though you don't work there,
[22:00.960 --> 22:02.760]  you're like still buddies with the crew there?
[22:02.760 --> 22:04.200]  Oh yeah, they're great people.
[22:04.200 --> 22:05.360]  They're awesome people.
[22:05.360 --> 22:06.480]  All right.
[22:06.480 --> 22:09.000]  So anyone in, and what part of Michigan is that?
[22:10.200 --> 22:14.000]  It's South, like 15, 20 minutes South of Detroit.
[22:14.000 --> 22:16.680]  Downriver Hydro is in Brownstown.
[22:18.240 --> 22:19.600]  Brownstown?
[22:19.600 --> 22:21.280]  So anyone who lives around there,
[22:21.280 --> 22:24.760]  you support them going there.
[22:27.440 --> 22:29.040]  So, okay, so, oh, sorry.
[22:29.040 --> 22:30.800]  So one of the things I wanted to see was,
[22:30.800 --> 22:32.800]  are there any worms in that,
[22:32.800 --> 22:34.720]  in those two beds you were showing me?
[22:37.480 --> 22:38.680]  Get under here.
[22:50.960 --> 22:54.400]  Yeah, usually I got the avocado in here popping.
[22:55.000 --> 22:57.000]  It's not hard to find the worms, but,
[23:01.480 --> 23:02.720]  there's a little guy.
[23:06.710 --> 23:08.710]  Just one little singular worm, but like,
[23:14.950 --> 23:17.070]  oh man, I could just play in this all day.
[23:18.030 --> 23:19.870]  So talk about, all right,
[23:19.870 --> 23:22.590]  so you have the Blue Mat system in there,
[23:22.590 --> 23:23.470]  but I want to get back,
[23:23.470 --> 23:26.470]  because I'm assuming you didn't have that in the beginning.
[23:26.470 --> 23:30.470]  So I want to go back to kind of your buildup
[23:30.470 --> 23:32.230]  to where you are today.
[23:32.230 --> 23:34.430]  So it was from the pots to the raised beds
[23:34.430 --> 23:36.230]  about a year and a half ago.
[23:38.190 --> 23:41.390]  And you have, sorry, so what,
[23:41.390 --> 23:43.830]  like you have what, compost in there?
[23:43.830 --> 23:46.270]  And then, like what,
[23:46.270 --> 23:48.310]  what, did you get that?
[23:48.310 --> 23:50.910]  Is basically everything coming from the grow store?
[23:51.830 --> 23:52.910]  Yeah, pretty much.
[23:52.910 --> 23:53.950]  Yeah.
[23:53.950 --> 23:55.830]  So what compost do you have in there?
[23:55.830 --> 23:58.230]  Like what was your, when you were?
[23:58.230 --> 24:02.150]  In the Stonington blend, it has lobster compost,
[24:03.070 --> 24:04.230]  which I like because of the chitin in it.
[24:04.230 --> 24:06.590]  And then, so I know that's in there already.
[24:06.590 --> 24:09.310]  And then I use Malibu compost as well.
[24:09.310 --> 24:11.910]  And that's it, Stonington blend,
[24:11.910 --> 24:14.230]  a little bit of compost and some rice hulls.
[24:15.790 --> 24:17.910]  Yeah, pumice is something that I wanted to use
[24:17.910 --> 24:19.430]  that I can't find around here.
[24:22.310 --> 24:23.630]  So, so, Harold, hold on.
[24:23.630 --> 24:28.700]  There was a, yeah, this is a,
[24:31.080 --> 24:33.640]  yeah, so, so, so when you, when you chop,
[24:33.640 --> 24:35.080]  do you leave the roots in
[24:35.440 --> 24:37.360]  and then just plant right next to them?
[24:37.360 --> 24:38.520]  Yep, yes, sir.
[24:38.520 --> 24:41.280]  Absolutely, absolutely.
[24:41.280 --> 24:43.400]  And then how long does it take for everything
[24:43.400 --> 24:45.720]  to break those roots systems down?
[24:47.480 --> 24:50.280]  I can reach in there and grab the old stem
[24:50.280 --> 24:53.560]  and just pull it out like a bone off of ribs
[24:53.560 --> 24:58.560]  after like seven to 14 days, one to two weeks.
[25:02.080 --> 25:04.120]  But I just leave it in there.
[25:04.960 --> 25:08.240]  This was the one I was looking for.
[25:11.590 --> 25:14.070]  I'm actually getting some,
[25:19.870 --> 25:24.870]  it's recycled newspaper from, what is it?
[25:25.790 --> 25:27.950]  Pit Moss, hold on, let me look them up.
[25:27.950 --> 25:30.750]  Oh yeah, yeah, I've heard about that stuff.
[25:30.750 --> 25:33.390]  So they just sent it out, but,
[25:33.710 --> 25:38.510]  so I wanna build out the next raised bed with that
[25:40.670 --> 25:43.390]  and see how it goes,
[25:43.390 --> 25:47.470]  but it's basically a replacement for Pit Moss and Cocoa.
[25:48.830 --> 25:50.390]  Yep, that's awesome.
[25:52.030 --> 25:54.870]  You already know how to do it.
[25:54.870 --> 25:58.350]  Okay, so basically you're in the raised beds,
[25:58.350 --> 26:01.750]  you have your mix, and then what,
[26:04.390 --> 26:07.030]  oh yeah, no, I think they were on,
[26:07.030 --> 26:09.510]  sorry, Dirty Cordia said they were on short time.
[26:11.510 --> 26:12.350]  Oh, cool.
[26:14.270 --> 26:19.270]  But, so initial irrigation, was it just hand watering?
[26:21.710 --> 26:22.910]  Yep, yep.
[26:22.910 --> 26:24.110]  Okay.
[26:24.110 --> 26:25.390]  And now like with the blue mats
[26:25.390 --> 26:26.670]  and learning everything I know,
[26:26.670 --> 26:27.710]  and like, that's why I can't wait
[26:27.710 --> 26:30.230]  for the lights in the four by eight tent to come on
[26:30.230 --> 26:35.230]  and because I had a malfunction, it was a user error.
[26:35.470 --> 26:39.630]  I connected the hose to one of the elbows, not properly.
[26:39.630 --> 26:42.390]  So when it came on, it just flooded the beds.
[26:42.390 --> 26:46.270]  So I shut them off and that happened like pretty early on.
[26:46.270 --> 26:48.510]  So the whole time, the two beds on the left
[26:48.510 --> 26:51.070]  have had been hand watered by me
[26:51.070 --> 26:52.870]  and the two on the right have had the blue mat.
[26:52.870 --> 26:56.630]  And it was like the best little accidental experiment
[26:56.630 --> 26:58.910]  that could ever have happened because it just,
[26:58.910 --> 27:00.710]  I already knew the power of the blue mat,
[27:00.710 --> 27:04.790]  but holy, it's just 10 times different.
[27:04.790 --> 27:06.790]  Nothing else was different besides that.
[27:06.790 --> 27:08.750]  I hand watered the ones on the left
[27:08.750 --> 27:11.430]  and the ones on the right were watered with the blue mat.
[27:11.430 --> 27:13.550]  But yeah, when I started, it was just,
[27:14.470 --> 27:15.790]  I was just doing the scoop,
[27:15.790 --> 27:18.550]  scooping half a gallon for whatever,
[27:18.550 --> 27:21.550]  like I would use a gallon for a 10 gallon pots.
[27:23.950 --> 27:26.510]  And then I found out like, that's not good.
[27:26.790 --> 27:29.070]  I was still doing where you would let it dry,
[27:29.070 --> 27:30.950]  like the chem bill or shit,
[27:30.950 --> 27:33.470]  water, let it dry, water, let it dry, water, let it dry.
[27:33.470 --> 27:35.670]  And that's not conducive to the microbes or none of that.
[27:35.670 --> 27:38.350]  So in the beginning, I would get like a plant here or there
[27:38.350 --> 27:40.950]  that would just like fry out or die or like,
[27:40.950 --> 27:44.150]  and I'd be like, that is weird, I've never seen that.
[27:44.150 --> 27:45.790]  Who knows what it could have been?
[27:45.790 --> 27:48.030]  Lots of things I could have been doing wrong.
[27:49.230 --> 27:53.190]  You're kind of touching on like a salt mindset
[27:53.190 --> 27:54.670]  that you needed to change.
[27:54.710 --> 27:57.230]  So what other like mindset things,
[27:58.150 --> 28:00.790]  because yeah, basically you wanna keep the moisture
[28:00.790 --> 28:04.670]  in a band that the microbes thrive in.
[28:04.670 --> 28:05.510]  Yes, sir.
[28:06.430 --> 28:08.750]  And that was it, just learning about, it's all microbes,
[28:08.750 --> 28:11.750]  everything, it's all about the microbes.
[28:11.750 --> 28:13.630]  Even like when I learned about human health and stuff,
[28:13.630 --> 28:15.870]  it's just the correlations between plants and humans
[28:15.870 --> 28:18.910]  is like, you can't ignore it.
[28:19.790 --> 28:22.030]  But some other things, let's see.
[28:22.910 --> 28:25.470]  Just like being mindless, you know?
[28:25.470 --> 28:26.950]  Like you don't have to think about shit
[28:26.950 --> 28:28.070]  when you're a chem bro.
[28:29.470 --> 28:31.390]  That might be like kind of like a harsh statement.
[28:31.390 --> 28:33.550]  You do, but not the same as like,
[28:33.550 --> 28:37.270]  you don't have to have that intimate relationship
[28:37.270 --> 28:38.510]  with your plant.
[28:38.510 --> 28:39.390]  You might think you have it,
[28:39.390 --> 28:44.390]  but you can't sit up like four feet of plant every time.
[28:44.950 --> 28:47.110]  Like eat, eat, eat, eat.
[28:47.110 --> 28:50.390]  They don't know, like, I didn't know
[28:50.390 --> 28:52.390]  that the microbes drive the plant's immunity
[28:52.390 --> 28:53.590]  and stuff like that.
[28:53.590 --> 28:54.750]  And the way that I was watering,
[28:54.750 --> 28:56.750]  like just being mindless, careless,
[28:56.750 --> 28:58.950]  not understanding the microbes and stuff.
[28:58.950 --> 29:00.870]  So it was just a transition from like,
[29:02.830 --> 29:07.510]  almost like a careless, like low work mindset,
[29:07.510 --> 29:10.150]  you know, like, cause there wasn't that like,
[29:10.150 --> 29:11.430]  yeah, I was interested in it,
[29:11.430 --> 29:13.870]  but there wasn't that like intimacy, you know?
[29:13.870 --> 29:18.870]  And so with your watering,
[29:21.990 --> 29:25.150]  like, are you doing any kind of top dressing
[29:25.150 --> 29:29.070]  or like, are you, like, for example,
[29:29.070 --> 29:32.550]  outside I have a worm bin and I take bleach
[29:32.550 --> 29:33.910]  and mix it in with water.
[29:33.910 --> 29:38.910]  Like, are you doing any foliar spray, top dressing?
[29:39.550 --> 29:40.390]  Oh yeah, yeah.
[29:40.390 --> 29:42.470]  I'll make some compost extract.
[29:42.470 --> 29:46.070]  I was huge on compost teas.
[29:47.190 --> 29:50.950]  So, you know, I watched a lot of your podcasts and stuff.
[29:50.950 --> 29:52.230]  And that's what I'm talking,
[29:52.230 --> 29:56.150]  cause I was so like, compost teas are like my thing.
[29:56.150 --> 29:59.510]  So like, and that's like where you have to have the ability
[29:59.510 --> 30:01.430]  to like take a step back and be like,
[30:01.430 --> 30:03.270]  okay, maybe it's not, you know,
[30:03.270 --> 30:04.230]  everything I thought it was.
[30:04.230 --> 30:05.950]  And that shit's hard for people to do,
[30:05.950 --> 30:10.030]  but you have to do it if you want to grow as a grower.
[30:10.230 --> 30:15.230]  So this actually brings me to what kind of water
[30:17.630 --> 30:18.790]  do you have?
[30:18.790 --> 30:23.790]  So I just use this little filter here.
[30:26.110 --> 30:28.390]  I've never tested my city water, to be honest.
[30:28.390 --> 30:29.790]  I tried to look, I thought that would be like
[30:29.790 --> 30:30.710]  kind of public knowledge.
[30:30.710 --> 30:32.710]  Like you just go on the city site
[30:32.710 --> 30:36.390]  and find out like what the water test was, but you can't.
[30:36.390 --> 30:37.670]  So I haven't called them.
[30:37.670 --> 30:41.070]  So that's just like a charcoal filter, basically.
[30:41.070 --> 30:42.350]  Yeah, it just takes out the chlorine,
[30:42.350 --> 30:43.710]  chloramine and hard water.
[30:45.350 --> 30:47.110]  You work with what you have.
[30:47.110 --> 30:48.670]  I mean, to me, it's interesting, you know,
[30:48.670 --> 30:51.790]  like people are talking about RO water
[30:51.790 --> 30:54.510]  and that's not necessarily the best thing,
[30:54.510 --> 30:57.910]  but there's so many large groves that use RO water.
[30:59.510 --> 31:02.830]  I wouldn't have used RO too until I found out that,
[31:02.830 --> 31:05.350]  cause they set up RO systems in like,
[31:05.350 --> 31:06.670]  I don't know if they're third world countries
[31:07.150 --> 31:08.990]  that just need help or whatever.
[31:08.990 --> 31:10.350]  So they set up these RO systems,
[31:10.350 --> 31:15.310]  but since there's nothing in that water, like nothing,
[31:15.310 --> 31:18.390]  it's like pulling calcium from your teeth.
[31:18.390 --> 31:19.670]  It's like leaching, you know?
[31:19.670 --> 31:22.150]  So I thought about that and I'm thinking,
[31:22.150 --> 31:23.990]  well, like if I'm putting that in soil,
[31:23.990 --> 31:25.950]  is that having some type of like the same effect?
[31:25.950 --> 31:28.150]  So it just like didn't sit right with me.
[31:28.150 --> 31:32.550]  And so I just went with a little charcoal filter.
[31:32.550 --> 31:37.550]  And sorry, we hit on, so the compost teas,
[31:43.110 --> 31:45.590]  was that just using like the Malibu compost
[31:45.590 --> 31:47.910]  and making it like, what were you doing?
[31:49.550 --> 31:52.470]  And then you say you're now moving to extracts versus teas.
[31:52.470 --> 31:53.950]  Is that kind of where you're going?
[31:53.950 --> 31:55.270]  Yeah, yes.
[31:58.510 --> 32:00.550]  With the teas, I got a microscope and stuff,
[32:00.550 --> 32:02.790]  so it makes it a little better for me.
[32:04.510 --> 32:08.070]  So let's see, I still have the base recipe right there.
[32:08.070 --> 32:11.710]  I've used two cups, worm castings or Malibu,
[32:11.710 --> 32:15.390]  six and a half tablespoons of blackstrap molasses,
[32:15.390 --> 32:18.070]  12 milliliters of fish hydrolysate
[32:18.070 --> 32:20.910]  and a tablespoon of rock phosphate
[32:20.910 --> 32:23.670]  and a tablespoon of kelp for a five gallon brew.
[32:23.670 --> 32:26.590]  And then I made the airlift brewer.
[32:26.590 --> 32:30.470]  So I don't know how to really describe how that works.
[32:31.390 --> 32:33.390]  It just pumps air through the bottom and it's like a lift.
[32:33.390 --> 32:35.670]  So it just lifts the water through the top.
[32:35.670 --> 32:40.270]  And then it's like the top of the PVC is like U-shaped.
[32:40.270 --> 32:41.910]  So it shoots the water back down
[32:41.910 --> 32:45.350]  into the five gallon bucket, mixes everything up.
[32:46.670 --> 32:48.990]  I like that better than a pump because the pump,
[32:48.990 --> 32:50.470]  you know, it's got an impeller
[32:50.470 --> 32:52.070]  and that's gonna be shredding up
[32:52.070 --> 32:53.770]  some of your micro life and stuff,
[32:54.630 --> 32:57.390]  being passed through there over and over and over and over.
[32:58.390 --> 33:02.670]  So I was huge on, I would use a composting once a week maybe.
[33:02.670 --> 33:04.310]  And I still, you know, I'll still use them here and there,
[33:04.310 --> 33:07.430]  but I'm not as like dogmatically minded about them,
[33:07.430 --> 33:12.270]  you know, and the extracts just, they're a lot easier.
[33:12.270 --> 33:14.250]  You know, it's immediate.
[33:15.630 --> 33:17.790]  And then I think something else you said was a top dress.
[33:17.790 --> 33:19.470]  I'll top dress to help.
[33:19.470 --> 33:21.590]  Well, actually before you get to the top dress,
[33:21.590 --> 33:24.550]  so you know how to use a microscope, right?
[33:25.270 --> 33:27.990]  Oh, just from what I taught myself, you know.
[33:27.990 --> 33:30.750]  You're starting, yeah, you're getting better
[33:30.750 --> 33:31.590]  and better at it.
[33:31.590 --> 33:35.030]  So are you notice anything when you look at like your teas
[33:35.030 --> 33:36.790]  versus your extracts where you're like,
[33:36.790 --> 33:38.550]  oh, I'm getting a lot of the same stuff
[33:38.550 --> 33:40.890]  with like one 10th the effort.
[33:42.350 --> 33:44.350]  So I've only made like two extracts
[33:44.350 --> 33:46.470]  and I haven't scoped them yet.
[33:46.470 --> 33:49.430]  So I can't compare that, but that is definitely something.
[33:49.430 --> 33:50.750]  I wanna do them like at the same time.
[33:50.750 --> 33:53.110]  I wanna whip up a tea and make an extract
[33:53.110 --> 33:55.710]  and do it basically like immediately side by side.
[33:57.230 --> 34:00.610]  But yeah, that's definitely something awesome to do.
[34:02.230 --> 34:05.270]  But to, oh, with the teas, the fungal jar is something
[34:05.270 --> 34:07.110]  that was really cool.
[34:07.110 --> 34:11.630]  I just took some of the Okashi brand from SD Microbes,
[34:11.630 --> 34:13.870]  sprinkle it in a little mason jar.
[34:15.910 --> 34:17.630]  I think I used two cups,
[34:17.630 --> 34:20.430]  two cups of the Malibu or worm castings.
[34:20.430 --> 34:22.070]  You know, just think a little bit of the brand
[34:22.070 --> 34:27.070]  that has the fungal food and shit probably like,
[34:28.830 --> 34:30.710]  well, then I would moisten it,
[34:30.710 --> 34:32.030]  mix it up a little bit with my hands,
[34:32.030 --> 34:33.310]  shake it up and stuff.
[34:33.310 --> 34:35.630]  And then I would cap it with a paper towel
[34:35.630 --> 34:38.030]  and put it just like in a cabinet or something.
[34:38.030 --> 34:39.110]  After three, four days,
[34:39.110 --> 34:41.390]  that would be inoculated with mycelium.
[34:41.390 --> 34:45.310]  And you take that and use that in your tea.
[34:50.560 --> 34:52.200]  Let's get teas and tap dresses.
[34:52.200 --> 34:54.440]  Yeah.
[34:55.320 --> 34:57.600]  That's cool that comments pop up there.
[34:57.600 --> 34:59.840]  Yeah, I'm having fun with that.
[34:59.840 --> 35:02.240]  But then I'm like trying to pay attention to you,
[35:02.240 --> 35:04.120]  but I like the comments are flying in.
[35:04.120 --> 35:05.640]  So I'm like reading them and then I'm like,
[35:05.640 --> 35:07.840]  wait, did he answer the question?
[35:07.840 --> 35:09.960]  Yeah, I keep getting off of the beans.
[35:09.960 --> 35:12.960]  All right, so you were about to move on
[35:12.960 --> 35:14.680]  to some of the other stuff you do.
[35:15.840 --> 35:19.040]  In addition to the teas and extracts.
[35:19.040 --> 35:21.600]  Well, the kelp, the kelp.
[35:21.600 --> 35:22.680]  Yeah, yeah, kelp.
[35:22.680 --> 35:25.520]  I like to make, I used to just top dress kelp,
[35:25.520 --> 35:30.520]  but I found out you can put X amount in a Mason jar
[35:30.680 --> 35:33.400]  or like a big gallon Mason jar
[35:33.400 --> 35:38.080]  and with clean water and cap it, shake it once a day.
[35:38.080 --> 35:41.040]  And on the third day you strain it and foliar it.
[35:41.040 --> 35:42.320]  And I've done that like twice.
[35:42.320 --> 35:43.560]  And every time it's like,
[35:43.560 --> 35:45.040]  I come back the next day, they're just praying.
[35:45.040 --> 35:46.760]  You know, there's some things you do
[35:46.760 --> 35:47.880]  where your plants just love it.
[35:47.880 --> 35:48.920]  And you know, it's from that.
[35:48.920 --> 35:51.480]  And that's one of them that says that helps for it.
[35:52.880 --> 35:54.520]  No, I don't pH the teas.
[35:56.440 --> 35:57.280]  And then.
[35:57.280 --> 36:00.680]  And then, so something's.
[36:00.680 --> 36:05.680]  The man with the ripped abs, little beast M training.
[36:06.560 --> 36:08.880]  I wish I did as many sit-ups as you do.
[36:09.880 --> 36:10.720]  Seriously.
[36:11.840 --> 36:12.680]  Oh, and so.
[36:16.720 --> 36:19.000]  Pandemic greenhouse, where are you?
[36:19.000 --> 36:21.240]  Are you, you said you're in California?
[36:27.620 --> 36:28.540]  Ah, here we go.
[36:34.620 --> 36:38.380]  So worms in the bin, how do you keep them thriving?
[36:38.380 --> 36:40.820]  Worms in my raised beds?
[36:40.820 --> 36:42.260]  Oh, sorry, in your raised beds.
[36:42.260 --> 36:43.100]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[36:45.220 --> 36:49.060]  Man, it's like worms, they control their population.
[36:51.060 --> 36:54.700]  The avocados, I don't, you know, I haven't taken,
[36:54.700 --> 36:55.940]  if I'm gonna use food scraps,
[36:55.940 --> 36:57.340]  I don't put the whole scraps in.
[36:57.340 --> 36:59.860]  I'll blend it up and put it in an avocado.
[37:00.860 --> 37:03.100]  Like blue is awesome.
[37:03.100 --> 37:04.820]  You're a blue disciple.
[37:04.820 --> 37:08.940]  Oh yeah, because I did, I had done that like two years ago,
[37:08.940 --> 37:10.500]  just by like chance, like my father,
[37:10.500 --> 37:13.620]  I had my father-in-law's and he left an avocado there
[37:13.620 --> 37:16.580]  and I put that in the soil and it was insane,
[37:16.580 --> 37:18.860]  but I never thought to mix stuff with it.
[37:18.860 --> 37:21.020]  And, you know, and I did it like once or twice,
[37:21.020 --> 37:23.020]  like, oh, cool worms, you know, whatever.
[37:23.020 --> 37:25.420]  I never did anything else with it until I found blue
[37:25.420 --> 37:26.700]  and blue's just doing great.
[37:26.700 --> 37:28.220]  Now he's doing the board tack and stuff.
[37:28.220 --> 37:29.940]  And that's awesome.
[37:29.940 --> 37:32.860]  I wanna do like, maybe do that in just like one tent
[37:32.860 --> 37:34.660]  in my little four by four tent,
[37:34.660 --> 37:36.860]  do no, like nothing but avocado tent.
[37:38.780 --> 37:40.340]  What, do you have what, red wig?
[37:40.340 --> 37:42.660]  Like, do you have a variety pack of worms in there
[37:42.660 --> 37:44.380]  or do you just have one type?
[37:44.380 --> 37:46.260]  No, I just have the red wigglers,
[37:46.260 --> 37:48.940]  but I was thinking about getting the night crawlers
[37:48.940 --> 37:50.180]  because they go deeper,
[37:50.180 --> 37:53.420]  but my beds are only 18 inches deep
[37:53.420 --> 37:57.860]  and there's probably like 15 inches of soil.
[37:58.540 --> 37:59.500]  So they probably benefit
[37:59.500 --> 38:01.220]  because they go about a foot deep.
[38:01.220 --> 38:05.660]  Do you, in the beds we're waiting for the lights to go on,
[38:05.660 --> 38:08.100]  do you have an avocado in there right now?
[38:08.100 --> 38:08.940]  No, I do not.
[38:08.940 --> 38:10.900]  No, I got the shells and stuff though.
[38:12.540 --> 38:15.220]  That's fine because Philippe Pio was asking,
[38:15.220 --> 38:17.820]  what is that avocado top dress about?
[38:17.820 --> 38:19.100]  Because he keeps hearing people talk.
[38:19.100 --> 38:21.220]  We'll show you in about 10 minutes.
[38:22.860 --> 38:27.460]  But generally the idea is to almost,
[38:28.100 --> 38:30.740]  it's basically to blend up a bunch of nutritious worm food
[38:30.740 --> 38:35.740]  and smear it on the inside of the half an avocado
[38:36.060 --> 38:37.580]  and then put it upside down
[38:37.580 --> 38:39.940]  and the worms kind of come up in there and eat
[38:39.940 --> 38:41.220]  and it's complete dark.
[38:41.220 --> 38:44.860]  You know, you have like a, sorry, no one can see me.
[38:44.860 --> 38:47.540]  You have like a canopy for the worms
[38:47.540 --> 38:50.180]  to stay sheltered underneath the avocado.
[38:50.180 --> 38:54.820]  So it's like you're building a home full of food
[38:54.820 --> 38:56.700]  for the worms and they come up.
[38:57.580 --> 38:59.820]  And they eat it and then they shit it all out
[38:59.820 --> 39:04.460]  and the nutrients go back down into your soil.
[39:04.460 --> 39:06.660]  But yeah, no, what I like about the night crawlers,
[39:06.660 --> 39:07.780]  you know, just having,
[39:07.780 --> 39:10.580]  cause you know, the red wigglers stay at the top
[39:10.580 --> 39:12.740]  and then if you can have other worms that will start to,
[39:12.740 --> 39:15.540]  you know, getting back to the aeration, go deep.
[39:17.260 --> 39:18.100]  It's like that.
[39:18.100 --> 39:19.300]  There you go for the rice holes.
[39:19.300 --> 39:20.140]  There you go.
[39:20.140 --> 39:21.860]  Maybe I could just add some night crawlers.
[39:21.860 --> 39:23.540]  They'll go deeper and they'll aerate deeper
[39:23.540 --> 39:27.420]  and the worms are aerating too in the top.
[39:28.380 --> 39:31.780]  So maybe that would be a good recourse.
[39:31.780 --> 39:35.700]  So what, I want to get to,
[39:38.740 --> 39:39.580]  well, how about this?
[39:39.580 --> 39:41.860]  When you were first setting up the blue mats,
[39:41.860 --> 39:46.060]  what are some lessons I'm going to learn the hard way?
[39:48.300 --> 39:51.300]  I think once you have them dialed in, they're amazing,
[39:51.300 --> 39:54.700]  but it does take some learning.
[39:54.700 --> 39:55.540]  Yeah.
[39:55.540 --> 39:57.020]  Can you walk us over to the bed
[39:57.020 --> 39:58.420]  that you can show us with the blue mats
[39:58.420 --> 40:01.340]  and just kind of talk about it?
[40:01.340 --> 40:04.260]  So each time I always get paranoid and worried
[40:04.260 --> 40:07.100]  because it takes like when you,
[40:07.100 --> 40:10.580]  so I've had these in, these ones in for like two cycles.
[40:10.580 --> 40:11.460]  I just kept them going.
[40:11.460 --> 40:13.340]  I didn't take them out and do anything
[40:15.460 --> 40:16.740]  because I feel like when I do that
[40:16.740 --> 40:18.980]  and that, cause I let the plants dry in here,
[40:19.860 --> 40:22.140]  it's not getting watered for 10 days and it gets dry
[40:22.140 --> 40:22.980]  and I don't like that.
[40:22.980 --> 40:24.420]  So I just left them in this time.
[40:24.420 --> 40:26.980]  But yeah, definitely don't get all paranoid
[40:26.980 --> 40:31.980]  and listen to, you gotta listen to Scott when he says,
[40:32.500 --> 40:34.460]  don't use that shit as a volume knob.
[40:34.460 --> 40:35.660]  Like he's not lying.
[40:35.660 --> 40:38.100]  So when you first put them in,
[40:38.100 --> 40:39.820]  you're like, you might see your soil get a little dry
[40:39.820 --> 40:41.900]  and you're like, oh, like maybe I should turn it up.
[40:41.900 --> 40:45.220]  Like maybe it's not watering, you know, enough, you know,
[40:45.220 --> 40:47.660]  you get paranoid and then you start twisting the knob
[40:47.660 --> 40:48.700]  next thing you know, it's running.
[40:48.700 --> 40:49.980]  You're like, oh, maybe it's too much.
[40:49.980 --> 40:51.700]  And you turn it back right to turn it down.
[40:51.700 --> 40:53.900]  Well, you can't do that.
[40:54.580 --> 40:57.460]  And you'll flood a bed, you'll get a runaway carrot
[40:57.460 --> 40:58.340]  really easy.
[40:59.300 --> 41:01.620]  So yeah, in the beginning, just let it ride,
[41:01.620 --> 41:03.980]  give it a couple of days, like at least one day
[41:03.980 --> 41:05.660]  when you make even a minor adjustment,
[41:05.660 --> 41:07.700]  just do a minor adjustment, wait a day.
[41:07.700 --> 41:09.860]  If around your plants looking dry or something,
[41:09.860 --> 41:13.260]  just water it a little bit with a watering can or something
[41:13.260 --> 41:15.460]  and keep the plants happy until the blue mats start ripping.
[41:15.460 --> 41:17.580]  Cause once they do, like you said, it's over.
[41:17.580 --> 41:20.500]  But in the beginning is where it's hard
[41:20.620 --> 41:23.420]  cause you get paranoid and I start doing stuff
[41:23.420 --> 41:26.260]  but you gotta just let it rock.
[41:28.180 --> 41:30.820]  And then also don't forget about the purge valve.
[41:30.820 --> 41:32.180]  That's pretty important because you know,
[41:32.180 --> 41:34.700]  little air bubbles and stuff like that get up in there.
[41:34.700 --> 41:36.300]  So I just purge it once a week,
[41:37.860 --> 41:41.460]  make sure there's no air, dirt or anything weird.
[41:41.460 --> 41:42.820]  But now that I don't have a reservoir,
[41:42.820 --> 41:45.420]  I've been getting less hangups and stuff.
[41:45.420 --> 41:50.420]  So it just runs from here over to my reducer.
[41:50.980 --> 41:53.780]  And then that runs to all three tents.
[41:58.270 --> 42:02.270]  And then making sure, that's why I like the Blue Lab,
[42:03.470 --> 42:05.150]  the pulse meter because I, you know,
[42:05.150 --> 42:07.830]  I'll water if I'm setting up a bed with blue mats,
[42:07.830 --> 42:09.390]  I'll water it, give it a couple hours
[42:09.390 --> 42:13.470]  and then I can go right in with that calibrated pulse meter
[42:13.470 --> 42:15.190]  and tell exactly where the moisture is at.
[42:15.190 --> 42:16.790]  And I can take multiple readings all around
[42:16.790 --> 42:18.510]  and make sure everything's all even.
[42:18.510 --> 42:22.510]  What's your target moisture level?
[42:22.510 --> 42:26.470]  I like, I feel like all plants are different,
[42:26.470 --> 42:30.630]  but generally speaking like 55, 60%
[42:30.630 --> 42:33.190]  because it goes by, it's not millibars like the...
[42:34.030 --> 42:34.870]  Okay.
[42:34.870 --> 42:35.870]  So it's a percent.
[42:35.870 --> 42:37.510]  And then it also tells me the EC
[42:37.510 --> 42:39.950]  and the temperature of the soil as well.
[42:39.950 --> 42:40.790]  Okay, yeah.
[42:40.790 --> 42:42.670]  Sorry, so you're not,
[42:42.670 --> 42:46.590]  that one's not spitting out a millibar reading.
[42:46.590 --> 42:47.430]  Correct.
[42:47.430 --> 42:52.430]  Because I have, give me one second.
[42:52.630 --> 42:55.190]  Let me see if I can find my blue mat ones.
[43:17.960 --> 43:20.960]  Yeah, I think they're all outside right now.
[43:23.520 --> 43:26.120]  But, because what I,
[43:26.120 --> 43:29.600]  I actually just pinged Michael Box to jump on with us.
[43:29.600 --> 43:32.200]  Because one of the questions I have, like,
[43:32.200 --> 43:34.400]  you, when you were like,
[43:36.720 --> 43:40.080]  you can take it and you can, sorry,
[43:40.080 --> 43:43.720]  you can stick it in the soil and it pretty much,
[43:43.720 --> 43:48.400]  how long does it take for a moisture meter to register?
[43:48.400 --> 43:50.120]  Is it like within a couple of seconds
[43:50.120 --> 43:52.080]  or do you need to leave it in there for an hour
[43:52.080 --> 43:54.400]  before it can accurately?
[43:54.400 --> 43:55.680]  It's essentially immediate.
[43:55.680 --> 43:57.400]  It's maybe like 10 seconds.
[43:57.400 --> 43:59.240]  You stick it in and click the button.
[43:59.240 --> 44:00.280]  So you can take that one
[44:00.280 --> 44:03.280]  and just check bed by bed by bed pretty quickly
[44:03.280 --> 44:05.360]  and be like, all right, everything's good.
[44:08.520 --> 44:12.520]  So let's talk about kind of what,
[44:12.520 --> 44:16.880]  well, actually, so what genetics are you running
[44:16.880 --> 44:21.200]  and kind of what have you grown over the years
[44:21.200 --> 44:23.840]  and where are you getting them from?
[44:23.840 --> 44:27.440]  So right now I'm growing Gorilla Glue
[44:27.440 --> 44:29.840]  and Lemon Garlic OG.
[44:29.840 --> 44:33.800]  The Lemon Garlic OG is from Humboldt.
[44:34.200 --> 44:42.560]  Or, yeah, Humboldt.
[44:42.560 --> 44:43.400]  I'm sorry.
[44:43.400 --> 44:44.440]  Yeah, Humboldt.
[44:44.440 --> 44:49.320]  And I-
[44:49.320 --> 44:51.960]  Do you mean like Humboldt Seed Company or what do you-
[44:51.960 --> 44:53.240]  Yeah. Okay.
[44:55.320 --> 44:56.520]  Oh, seed organization.
[44:56.520 --> 44:57.360]  All right.
[44:57.360 --> 44:59.440]  Not to be confused with Humboldt Seed Company.
[45:00.480 --> 45:02.960]  See, I didn't even know there was a difference.
[45:02.960 --> 45:04.760]  Well, that's, I give Nat shit,
[45:04.760 --> 45:07.200]  who is the guy behind Humboldt Seed Company.
[45:07.200 --> 45:10.320]  So this is Humboldt Seed Company.
[45:10.320 --> 45:11.240]  Okay.
[45:11.240 --> 45:15.280]  And you're holding Humboldt Seed Organization.
[45:15.280 --> 45:16.120]  Okay.
[45:16.120 --> 45:21.120]  And I bet half the world thinks they're the same company.
[45:22.280 --> 45:24.000]  Yeah, shit, I did, fuck.
[45:25.920 --> 45:26.760]  Let's see.
[45:29.440 --> 45:32.880]  I joined the auction with Seattle Chronic Seeds for Nick.
[45:33.560 --> 45:34.400]  And-
[45:34.400 --> 45:37.040]  Yes, Gloria, I'm in Los Angeles.
[45:38.160 --> 45:40.440]  And I got, on the way,
[45:40.440 --> 45:44.080]  I got two cuts of Miracle Girl from Capilator
[45:44.080 --> 45:48.200]  and Thug Pugs, Monkey Business,
[45:48.200 --> 45:51.880]  and then Santa's Cookies,
[45:51.880 --> 45:53.520]  but I don't know who the Santa's Cookies from.
[45:53.520 --> 45:55.160]  I can't remember.
[45:55.160 --> 45:56.920]  But that's stuff you just got, right?
[45:56.920 --> 45:57.880]  You haven't run that out.
[45:57.880 --> 45:58.720]  Okay.
[45:58.720 --> 46:01.320]  Right now I have the Lemon Garlic.
[46:01.320 --> 46:03.160]  Over time, like, do you have certain stuff
[46:03.160 --> 46:06.240]  that's been in the lineup for all six years
[46:06.240 --> 46:08.520]  or are you constantly,
[46:09.440 --> 46:13.280]  do you have ADD when it comes to cultivars or yeah?
[46:13.280 --> 46:14.120]  Yeah.
[46:14.120 --> 46:15.880]  You like to try different stuff.
[46:15.880 --> 46:17.040]  Yeah, yeah, I do.
[46:17.040 --> 46:19.320]  I just, I like growing from seed, you know?
[46:19.320 --> 46:23.160]  And the dudes from Soul Rebel hit me up a little while ago.
[46:23.160 --> 46:25.240]  So I like test their genetics before they release them,
[46:25.240 --> 46:27.160]  make sure they're stable and stuff.
[46:27.160 --> 46:30.080]  So he keeps me laced up with seeds all the time.
[46:30.080 --> 46:34.040]  And I got some stuff called El Sabor by them right now
[46:34.040 --> 46:34.920]  that I'm really pumped about.
[46:34.920 --> 46:37.520]  Everything they've given me has been just awesome.
[46:37.520 --> 46:38.960]  You know, it's so different.
[46:41.320 --> 46:43.080]  Like, this is the first time I've grown the Gorilla Glue.
[46:43.080 --> 46:44.560]  Like, I don't like the mainstream stuff.
[46:44.560 --> 46:46.200]  I don't know why.
[46:46.200 --> 46:48.760]  Maybe it's just a knee-jerk reaction or something,
[46:48.760 --> 46:51.480]  but this is the first time I've grown the Gorilla Glue.
[46:51.480 --> 46:54.360]  But like, I've liked White Fire OG was my favorite
[46:54.360 --> 46:55.320]  and I lost that one.
[46:55.320 --> 46:56.680]  I forget how,
[46:56.680 --> 46:58.600]  but I like really remember kicking myself
[46:58.600 --> 46:59.640]  in the ass for that.
[47:02.240 --> 47:03.440]  Man, no, there's not really one
[47:03.440 --> 47:05.600]  I kept around for a long time.
[47:05.600 --> 47:08.920]  I wish I would've kept the Poison Mimosa by Soul Rebel.
[47:08.920 --> 47:09.760]  That was amazing.
[47:09.760 --> 47:11.760]  The Purple Taste by them was amazing.
[47:14.080 --> 47:17.280]  That White Fire OG I got from my boss
[47:17.280 --> 47:18.600]  when I worked at the grocery store.
[47:18.600 --> 47:21.680]  He went out to California and came back with those.
[47:21.680 --> 47:24.080]  So I bought them from him and it was just,
[47:24.080 --> 47:26.120]  that's what made me love the OGs
[47:26.560 --> 47:28.600]  and I got like Musty, like Heavy Hittin'.
[47:29.920 --> 47:31.320]  But yeah, and then I got,
[47:33.520 --> 47:34.480]  oh yeah, that's it right now.
[47:34.480 --> 47:36.680]  Lemon Garlic OG and the Gorilla Glue.
[47:38.000 --> 47:40.720]  So just quickly before I forget,
[47:40.720 --> 47:42.120]  that's why I can have these things up,
[47:42.120 --> 47:44.200]  but do you use cover crops?
[47:44.200 --> 47:49.200]  Yes, I use the Rye Clover Mix
[47:50.120 --> 47:51.760]  and the Rye just take it over.
[47:51.760 --> 47:54.600]  Like, there's literally no clovers.
[47:54.800 --> 47:58.280]  I don't like the Rye because it's hard to keep cut back.
[47:58.280 --> 48:00.600]  You gotta cut it like a lawn, like once a week.
[48:00.600 --> 48:02.160]  And then if you top dress it
[48:02.160 --> 48:04.040]  or if you just chop and drop all that stuff,
[48:04.040 --> 48:06.200]  it creates like a mat on the surface of the soil
[48:06.200 --> 48:07.520]  and you start getting fungus mats
[48:07.520 --> 48:10.080]  because you're creating that anaerobic environment.
[48:11.000 --> 48:12.800]  So I've just been chopping it
[48:12.800 --> 48:14.600]  and either putting it in my compost pile
[48:14.600 --> 48:18.040]  or like blending it and putting it back in somehow.
[48:19.360 --> 48:21.960]  Other than that, I've used the 12 Seed Mix
[48:21.960 --> 48:24.880]  from Build A Soil.
[48:24.880 --> 48:26.720]  I've used, one that I got online,
[48:26.720 --> 48:29.040]  it was like a No-Till 13 Seed Mix.
[48:29.040 --> 48:30.560]  That was pretty cool.
[48:30.560 --> 48:32.640]  I've grown, Nasturtium was my favorite.
[48:32.640 --> 48:35.200]  There's a picture somewhere way back on my Instagram
[48:35.200 --> 48:38.640]  of the four by four raised bed from my old spot.
[48:38.640 --> 48:41.240]  And it's just got the Bubble Chem growing in it.
[48:41.240 --> 48:44.480]  Monsters with a big, giant Nasturtium plant
[48:44.480 --> 48:46.920]  that when I read about them,
[48:46.920 --> 48:49.280]  said like even the longest ones,
[48:49.280 --> 48:52.080]  the longer varieties take like 70 days to flower,
[48:52.080 --> 48:53.960]  but my Nasturtium never flowered.
[48:53.960 --> 48:56.840]  So that was just kind of interesting to me.
[48:56.840 --> 48:59.280]  Other than that, I just like, I like the Clovers.
[49:00.240 --> 49:02.240]  I like Vetch, even though it's kind of like,
[49:02.240 --> 49:03.640]  it's a binding thing,
[49:03.640 --> 49:06.040]  but if you plant it at the right time, I like it.
[49:07.960 --> 49:10.040]  Yeah, cover crops are the shit.
[49:10.040 --> 49:14.240]  What, sorry, and I'm totally blanking on,
[49:14.240 --> 49:18.920]  what was growing in those beds that you just showed us?
[49:19.560 --> 49:22.200]  That's the next round of the Lemon Garlic OG.
[49:22.200 --> 49:24.880]  And there are babies in there, right?
[49:24.880 --> 49:25.720]  Yes.
[49:25.720 --> 49:26.560]  Okay, all right.
[49:26.560 --> 49:28.920]  I was like, do I remember seeing plants in there?
[49:30.720 --> 49:34.000]  So, all right, so that's the Lemon Garlic OG.
[49:34.000 --> 49:37.960]  And are you mostly, are you a flower guy?
[49:37.960 --> 49:40.560]  Are you a dabber?
[49:40.560 --> 49:42.920]  Are you an equal opportunist?
[49:45.160 --> 49:46.280]  I'm mostly a flower guy,
[49:46.280 --> 49:47.960]  but I got a little press and stuff.
[49:48.520 --> 49:50.080]  I'm for the people.
[49:50.080 --> 49:51.760]  I wanna put myself in a situation
[49:51.760 --> 49:53.200]  where I can grow to help people.
[49:53.200 --> 49:55.200]  So I started making edibles,
[49:55.200 --> 49:59.800]  and that's been huge because my mom, she doesn't smoke,
[49:59.800 --> 50:01.080]  she doesn't do anything with weed,
[50:01.080 --> 50:02.760]  but she doesn't sleep well.
[50:02.760 --> 50:04.240]  My sister's got a messed up back.
[50:04.240 --> 50:06.160]  There's just so many people that are suffering,
[50:06.160 --> 50:07.880]  and I know cannabis can help.
[50:07.880 --> 50:11.320]  And it's just this mindset that they've been like,
[50:11.320 --> 50:13.800]  oh, weed is, you can't be a functioning maker.
[50:13.800 --> 50:15.760]  I'm like, look at me, I'm high all the fucking time.
[50:15.800 --> 50:18.000]  I'm always busting my, you know,
[50:18.000 --> 50:20.360]  so it's just like a misconception.
[50:20.360 --> 50:23.720]  But like, so yeah, I'm mostly a flower guy,
[50:23.720 --> 50:26.840]  but lately edibles have been like amazing for me.
[50:26.840 --> 50:29.520]  Now I'm more like kicking myself in the butt
[50:29.520 --> 50:31.720]  while I haven't been doing that instead.
[50:31.720 --> 50:34.400]  It's like, I'll have to smoke all day, all day.
[50:34.400 --> 50:36.160]  It's like, I'm just like a super anxious person.
[50:36.160 --> 50:37.640]  And then at the tail end of that,
[50:37.640 --> 50:39.840]  what people don't realize is sometimes smoking too much
[50:39.840 --> 50:41.320]  will make you anxious and paranoid.
[50:41.320 --> 50:44.640]  And that was something that I didn't wanna admit early on.
[50:45.560 --> 50:50.000]  So edibles are more what I'm leaning towards now.
[50:51.560 --> 50:52.640]  But like I got a little press,
[50:52.640 --> 50:54.680]  so if someone wants a little wax or something,
[50:54.680 --> 50:55.520]  you know, I can.
[50:56.480 --> 51:00.680]  Where is your press like within reaching distance?
[51:00.680 --> 51:01.880]  Yeah, it's just a little.
[51:05.040 --> 51:06.680]  No smasher, man.
[51:06.680 --> 51:09.200]  So there is no way to flip the,
[51:09.200 --> 51:12.200]  to get the camera on the other side, right?
[51:12.200 --> 51:13.800]  Not that I can figure out.
[51:14.800 --> 51:16.680]  I feel bad for you having to like,
[51:17.800 --> 51:21.480]  having to show everybody like that.
[51:22.400 --> 51:24.200]  All right, so there's your press.
[51:25.720 --> 51:27.480]  It's a little nug smasher.
[51:27.480 --> 51:29.120]  It's a small plate, right?
[51:29.120 --> 51:31.320]  Yeah, but it only does an eighth at a time.
[51:33.040 --> 51:36.640]  And are you washing and then pressing that
[51:36.640 --> 51:38.760]  or are you pressing straight flour?
[51:38.760 --> 51:40.560]  No, I'm just pressing straight flour,
[51:40.560 --> 51:42.480]  but it's, this is why I love this community.
[51:42.480 --> 51:46.600]  I just got a guy messaged me about the blue mats
[51:46.600 --> 51:47.880]  and next thing you know, we're bullshitting.
[51:47.880 --> 51:48.800]  He was on the ranger.
[51:48.800 --> 51:50.760]  So we're like, we're talking, you know,
[51:50.760 --> 51:55.200]  and next thing you know, he's like,
[51:55.200 --> 51:57.640]  oh, you like asking me about what you're taught,
[51:57.640 --> 51:58.520]  washing it and stuff.
[51:58.520 --> 51:59.400]  And he's telling me like,
[51:59.400 --> 52:00.960]  oh, like I gotta teach that and stuff.
[52:00.960 --> 52:02.760]  So like, I'm down for that.
[52:02.760 --> 52:05.440]  Like learning is a gift to me.
[52:05.440 --> 52:06.280]  I love it.
[52:07.160 --> 52:08.280]  The best part about it, you know?
[52:08.280 --> 52:09.280]  So when people hit me up,
[52:09.280 --> 52:10.320]  they're like, oh, sorry to bug you.
[52:10.320 --> 52:12.200]  I'm like, no, like send it, you know?
[52:12.880 --> 52:13.720]  Like I wanna hear it.
[52:13.720 --> 52:14.560]  I wanna know.
[52:14.560 --> 52:15.400]  Well, how about this?
[52:15.400 --> 52:18.320]  So you don't currently wash at all, right?
[52:18.320 --> 52:19.160]  Correct.
[52:19.160 --> 52:24.160]  If I got, I'm gonna see if I can get Roz and Evolution
[52:27.280 --> 52:29.480]  to send you that kit.
[52:30.680 --> 52:31.520]  Would that work for you?
[52:31.520 --> 52:32.360]  Really dude?
[52:32.360 --> 52:33.200]  Yeah.
[52:33.200 --> 52:34.120]  Really?
[52:34.120 --> 52:36.120]  So I'm gonna put them on the spot
[52:36.120 --> 52:38.120]  that they have to send this to you
[52:38.120 --> 52:40.160]  for being on the show with us.
[52:40.160 --> 52:41.600]  But-
[52:41.600 --> 52:43.520]  Wow, man, I appreciate that.
[52:43.520 --> 52:47.200]  And, but you're gonna have to be my reminder to be like,
[52:47.200 --> 52:48.560]  remember you promised me?
[52:50.040 --> 52:53.360]  But yeah, that's a, yeah, it's a five gallon.
[52:53.360 --> 53:06.030]  So like, if you have, you know, bucket, that,
[53:10.510 --> 53:12.430]  yeah, you're at a small enough scale
[53:12.430 --> 53:13.950]  that to start with just to, you know,
[53:13.950 --> 53:15.950]  have fun with a five gallon.
[53:15.950 --> 53:16.790]  Yeah, man.
[53:18.830 --> 53:21.870]  Play around with that for a while, press that.
[53:21.870 --> 53:26.070]  And then we'll check back in with you in like a month.
[53:26.070 --> 53:27.790]  I don't even know if I've ever smoked anything
[53:27.790 --> 53:29.470]  like that either.
[53:29.470 --> 53:30.350]  What's that?
[53:30.350 --> 53:33.990]  I don't think I've ever smoked anything like that either.
[53:33.990 --> 53:35.270]  Rozin?
[53:35.270 --> 53:37.630]  Like, not like that, no, just a flower.
[53:39.510 --> 53:43.750]  So someone asked a while ago,
[53:43.750 --> 53:46.110]  or now let me see how far back it is.
[53:51.120 --> 53:54.280]  So can you, you know, do you keep,
[53:55.240 --> 53:58.920]  like, if you find an all-star, do you try to keep it?
[53:58.920 --> 54:03.240]  And like as a mom, or are you just like done
[54:03.240 --> 54:05.680]  and you're on to the popping the next seeds?
[54:05.680 --> 54:09.040]  So I would before, but now that I'm really,
[54:09.040 --> 54:12.160]  really limited on space, it's really hard to do that.
[54:12.160 --> 54:14.560]  That's why I've been thinking about turning my four by four
[54:14.560 --> 54:16.320]  into a mother tent.
[54:16.320 --> 54:18.120]  And I had, you know, the two beds in there.
[54:18.320 --> 54:23.240]  So trying to find two strains that I really like
[54:23.240 --> 54:26.840]  and mother them out, the winners out in the two beds,
[54:26.840 --> 54:29.480]  and then take a bunch of cuts and then be able to fill
[54:29.480 --> 54:32.480]  a four by eight and a five by nine with that,
[54:32.480 --> 54:35.000]  with those genetics that I go by, I haven't done that yet.
[54:35.000 --> 54:39.280]  So, but the lemon garlic is the first one that just,
[54:39.280 --> 54:41.040]  I'm like, wow, observing everything.
[54:41.040 --> 54:42.560]  I'm like, they were speaking like garlic
[54:42.560 --> 54:44.520]  when I was breaking leaf sauce in the beds
[54:44.520 --> 54:45.760]  and I couldn't believe it.
[54:46.600 --> 54:49.200]  So I definitely want to keep this one around.
[54:49.200 --> 54:51.440]  So I might do that, I might mother it,
[54:51.440 --> 54:54.880]  but I need two cuts at the same time to be able to mother
[54:54.880 --> 54:56.400]  them the right way in that same tent.
[54:56.400 --> 54:58.760]  So they're not different sizes and stuff like that,
[54:58.760 --> 54:59.600]  you know?
[54:59.600 --> 55:02.960]  So it's just a little like figuring and just like
[55:02.960 --> 55:04.840]  with the space that I have, you know?
[55:04.840 --> 55:05.680]  Yeah.
[55:10.680 --> 55:11.880]  What was my...
[55:15.600 --> 55:20.360]  People are digging the comments popping up.
[55:20.360 --> 55:21.440]  Oh yeah, that's cool.
[55:25.280 --> 55:26.640]  So this one...
[55:30.600 --> 55:34.160]  So interestingly, we talked about planting the,
[55:35.320 --> 55:39.000]  you know, I would never eat or want to eat
[55:39.000 --> 55:40.720]  kind of the Monsanto corn,
[55:40.720 --> 55:45.120]  but the corn that repels caterpillar,
[55:46.800 --> 55:50.160]  if you planted that around your weed
[55:50.160 --> 55:52.560]  and then the caterpillar would eat that and die.
[55:52.560 --> 55:54.440]  I think it's either they eat it and die
[55:54.440 --> 55:57.600]  or they just don't, I can't tell if they like it
[55:57.600 --> 56:00.720]  and then die or if it just repels them straight up.
[56:00.720 --> 56:03.680]  But we were joking when we said that,
[56:03.720 --> 56:07.560]  but then we were like, that could actually work.
[56:07.560 --> 56:11.800]  Yeah, so that kind of makes sense because there's a man,
[56:11.800 --> 56:13.400]  I can't remember his name.
[56:13.400 --> 56:14.400]  I have one of his books,
[56:14.400 --> 56:17.680]  but he's a market gardener for a veggie gardener.
[56:17.680 --> 56:22.680]  And what he does is he has like these plots of his crops.
[56:22.920 --> 56:24.240]  So like plot one, two, three, four,
[56:24.240 --> 56:26.680]  and it's probably like a 40 by 40 area.
[56:26.680 --> 56:31.680]  But alongside he's got tons and tons and tons of variety
[56:31.840 --> 56:35.400]  of like companion, like not even like bushes and stuff,
[56:35.400 --> 56:38.320]  but it's all selected purposefully because it's like,
[56:38.320 --> 56:40.480]  oh, this bush attracts this predator,
[56:40.480 --> 56:42.120]  that bush attracts that predator.
[56:42.120 --> 56:43.600]  And then what they do is they'll plant,
[56:43.600 --> 56:46.240]  they'll interplant birdhouses too.
[56:46.240 --> 56:49.240]  So like, imagine like your 40 by 40 plot
[56:49.240 --> 56:50.520]  and then along each side,
[56:50.520 --> 56:52.520]  there's like the banker plants and stuff
[56:53.680 --> 56:55.200]  or like plants that are selected
[56:55.200 --> 56:57.760]  to specifically attract certain predators
[56:57.760 --> 56:59.720]  and a variety of predators.
[56:59.720 --> 57:01.560]  So again, diversity is key.
[57:02.440 --> 57:03.720]  In my veggie garden,
[57:03.720 --> 57:06.960]  I don't have to worry about bugs and pests
[57:06.960 --> 57:11.080]  because I got hawks in the trees that live up there.
[57:11.080 --> 57:13.440]  So the bunnies don't ravage my stuff.
[57:13.440 --> 57:16.080]  I have parasitic wasps that go to my apple mint.
[57:16.080 --> 57:19.360]  So the caterpillars that try to eat my stuff,
[57:19.360 --> 57:23.040]  I also have a black digger wasp that I saw.
[57:23.040 --> 57:25.080]  And that one, it stings the caterpillar
[57:25.080 --> 57:27.000]  and drags it back to its underground,
[57:27.000 --> 57:30.600]  like nest and feeds it to its offspring
[57:30.760 --> 57:32.560]  while it's still alive, but just paralyzed.
[57:32.560 --> 57:35.720]  So like planting a variety of plants
[57:35.720 --> 57:39.840]  that are gonna attract the whole food web,
[57:39.840 --> 57:41.040]  like you can't go wrong there.
[57:41.040 --> 57:41.880]  Like, yeah, you'll have,
[57:41.880 --> 57:43.760]  like I'll see caterpillars here and there,
[57:43.760 --> 57:45.400]  but it's nothing like, you know,
[57:45.400 --> 57:47.160]  next door where they're just being ravaged
[57:47.160 --> 57:49.240]  because they're practicing and stuff.
[57:51.800 --> 57:56.280]  So I would just suggest planting a lot of variety,
[57:56.280 --> 57:58.160]  pretty plant, like it looks pretty too,
[57:58.160 --> 57:59.080]  that guy's plot, you know,
[57:59.080 --> 58:00.920]  it's not like just random like mess growing,
[58:00.920 --> 58:02.360]  like it's pretty flowers and stuff.
[58:02.360 --> 58:04.920]  And you're just loaded with beneficial bugs.
[58:04.920 --> 58:08.280]  Like that's it, and birds that eat the bugs and stuff.
[58:08.280 --> 58:10.240]  He's just creating an ecosystem.
[58:10.240 --> 58:13.960]  Yeah, so I just uploaded, I just posted in the chat,
[58:13.960 --> 58:18.600]  but a video, Tyler from Family Tree Seeds
[58:18.600 --> 58:22.320]  stopped by Tom's house, what's today, Wednesday.
[58:22.320 --> 58:24.960]  I think that was Saturday or Sunday.
[58:25.000 --> 58:28.440]  We basically built a simple, you know,
[58:28.440 --> 58:33.440]  moth netting out of PVC pipe and just mosquito netting.
[58:34.240 --> 58:36.440]  And I think that the thing he was talking about was,
[58:36.440 --> 58:38.040]  you know, they don't show up to the party
[58:38.040 --> 58:41.320]  until basically your plants start to flower.
[58:41.320 --> 58:44.160]  So like you don't need the netting
[58:44.160 --> 58:46.200]  until that point in time,
[58:47.280 --> 58:49.480]  and then just, you know, keep that over them
[58:49.480 --> 58:52.040]  for the whole flowering period.
[58:52.360 --> 58:55.680]  And then obviously things like the parasitic wasps
[58:55.680 --> 59:00.680]  and other stuff, you know, up until that point in the BT,
[59:00.680 --> 59:04.000]  but like I wouldn't wanna spray BT in flower.
[59:05.280 --> 59:07.040]  His point was they're not really there.
[59:07.040 --> 59:10.720]  I mean, they show up right before flower.
[59:10.720 --> 59:14.360]  So like if you're spraying with BT two months before that,
[59:14.360 --> 59:19.320]  it seems like it's kind of a useless thing to do.
[59:19.320 --> 59:20.840]  Yeah.
[59:20.840 --> 59:24.440]  Because those caterpillar wanna burrow, you know,
[59:24.440 --> 59:27.680]  corn was their jam until weed came along
[59:27.680 --> 59:30.080]  and they were like, wait, this thing is like a-
[59:30.080 --> 59:31.720]  A lot better.
[59:31.720 --> 59:33.440]  Yeah, it's the same concept
[59:33.440 --> 59:35.600]  because they wanna burrow in it.
[59:35.600 --> 59:38.160]  And so anyway.
[59:42.040 --> 59:43.920]  Oh, the lights are on.
[59:43.920 --> 59:44.760]  Oh, nice.
[59:46.320 --> 59:48.880]  I was gonna say we needed the dramatic buildup
[59:48.880 --> 59:52.200]  or like the countdown clock from when we started talking
[59:53.160 --> 59:55.120]  to when the lights gone, we can actually see the grow.
[01:00:09.600 --> 01:00:11.360]  Man, I wish I could flip it around.
[01:00:16.410 --> 01:00:18.290]  So what's growing in there right now?
[01:00:18.290 --> 01:00:20.930]  That's the lemon garlic.
[01:00:20.930 --> 01:00:25.930]  Yeah, so these two, man, I can't tell.
[01:00:26.170 --> 01:00:29.250]  These two on the left have been hand watered
[01:00:30.930 --> 01:00:32.730]  and these have been on the blue mat.
[01:00:41.150 --> 01:00:43.670]  And I assume when you're indoor grow,
[01:00:43.670 --> 01:00:45.550]  you're not battling with caterpillar.
[01:00:46.430 --> 01:00:47.270]  Yeah, right.
[01:00:47.270 --> 01:00:48.790]  No, just the-
[01:00:50.790 --> 01:00:51.630]  What's that?
[01:00:51.630 --> 01:00:55.830]  Well, I was gonna say what bugs are showing up indoor?
[01:00:57.310 --> 01:00:59.670]  The only problem I've had is probably-
[01:00:59.670 --> 01:01:00.510]  Okay.
[01:01:01.470 --> 01:01:02.710]  But, oh, in the tents, I'm sorry.
[01:01:02.710 --> 01:01:06.150]  I've had definitely, I've definitely had,
[01:01:06.150 --> 01:01:07.590]  it was just PM in the tents.
[01:01:07.590 --> 01:01:10.070]  I've definitely had bugs at the other spot.
[01:01:11.030 --> 01:01:12.310]  It's gonna happen.
[01:01:12.310 --> 01:01:16.590]  People, they get too egotistical about it maybe.
[01:01:16.590 --> 01:01:17.430]  I don't know.
[01:01:17.430 --> 01:01:18.270]  I've definitely been that person.
[01:01:18.270 --> 01:01:20.510]  They don't wanna tell anyone they got a problem.
[01:01:20.510 --> 01:01:21.350]  It happens.
[01:01:21.350 --> 01:01:23.590]  They just gotta figure out how to attack it.
[01:01:25.390 --> 01:01:26.230]  Yeah.
[01:01:26.230 --> 01:01:27.710]  Can't hide it, can't ignore it.
[01:01:33.050 --> 01:01:34.970]  Okay, so with,
[01:01:38.410 --> 01:01:40.090]  it's a very short garden tour.
[01:01:45.180 --> 01:01:47.900]  And you, did you just flip those?
[01:01:48.900 --> 01:01:50.860]  Yeah, I flipped them.
[01:01:50.860 --> 01:01:55.500]  I got it written down over here on the second.
[01:01:55.500 --> 01:01:56.980]  So it's today.
[01:01:56.980 --> 01:02:00.460]  The 14th, so 12 days ago.
[01:02:05.210 --> 01:02:10.050]  And what, can you talk about kind of what you're noticing
[01:02:10.050 --> 01:02:11.290]  about how those grow?
[01:02:11.290 --> 01:02:12.810]  And you had mentioned before,
[01:02:12.810 --> 01:02:15.370]  like some plants like a little more moisture
[01:02:15.370 --> 01:02:16.290]  and some a little less.
[01:02:16.770 --> 01:02:18.570]  So like, where do these ones fit in?
[01:02:20.890 --> 01:02:22.930]  So these ones, when I tested,
[01:02:22.930 --> 01:02:27.410]  the lowest I've tested is 55% moisture
[01:02:27.410 --> 01:02:28.770]  and the highest is 70.
[01:02:29.810 --> 01:02:33.650]  So that's a variation that I wanna try to like take care of.
[01:02:33.650 --> 01:02:36.130]  Maybe I didn't moisten the bed evenly
[01:02:36.130 --> 01:02:38.450]  when I initially put the blue mats in.
[01:02:38.450 --> 01:02:42.010]  So it was like a 20% swing throughout the bed of moisture
[01:02:43.170 --> 01:02:44.650]  also at varying levels.
[01:02:44.650 --> 01:02:48.650]  So like I can stick that thing like two inches
[01:02:48.650 --> 01:02:51.290]  into the soil and see what the top of the soil moisture
[01:02:51.290 --> 01:02:52.130]  is like.
[01:02:52.130 --> 01:02:53.170]  I can stick it nine inches down
[01:02:53.170 --> 01:02:55.290]  and see what it's like way down there.
[01:02:55.290 --> 01:02:58.650]  And that's been about where I want it.
[01:02:58.650 --> 01:02:59.850]  I got the long carrots in there.
[01:02:59.850 --> 01:03:01.010]  So that's probably why.
[01:03:02.530 --> 01:03:05.330]  I'd like to use one short carrot and a long carrot.
[01:03:05.330 --> 01:03:09.290]  I've been trying to figure out how to do that.
[01:03:09.290 --> 01:03:12.370]  So I can get the moisture right at each level.
[01:03:13.130 --> 01:03:15.170]  Someone asked a little while ago,
[01:03:15.170 --> 01:03:20.170]  what kind of LED's you're running?
[01:03:20.170 --> 01:03:21.850]  They are the Nestle Core.
[01:03:24.530 --> 01:03:25.370]  Okay.
[01:03:25.370 --> 01:03:28.770]  And then over here, I got a Lora Flux six blade.
[01:03:30.250 --> 01:03:35.090]  And then your tents are what, four by eights or what?
[01:03:37.130 --> 01:03:40.210]  Four by four, four by eight and a four by nine
[01:03:40.210 --> 01:03:41.890]  or a five by nine, I'm sorry.
[01:03:41.890 --> 01:03:42.730]  Okay.
[01:03:45.090 --> 01:03:46.490]  And these are the blue.
[01:03:46.490 --> 01:03:49.930]  So the first crop I ran on the blue was right before
[01:03:49.930 --> 01:03:52.770]  this one and it was in the four by four.
[01:03:52.770 --> 01:03:55.170]  And they were just all stressed out,
[01:03:55.170 --> 01:03:57.210]  like working a lot worse than these,
[01:03:57.210 --> 01:03:58.250]  but the same stuff, right?
[01:03:58.250 --> 01:04:00.050]  But just more progressed.
[01:04:00.050 --> 01:04:01.890]  So through the Instagram community,
[01:04:01.890 --> 01:04:05.570]  they're telling me that Gorilla Blue are mag whores.
[01:04:05.570 --> 01:04:06.970]  They just eat a lot.
[01:04:06.970 --> 01:04:10.170]  So this run, I foliared them a lot,
[01:04:10.170 --> 01:04:12.810]  like once a week with the Organics Alive
[01:04:12.810 --> 01:04:17.050]  and that Green Aminos and the deficiencies are less,
[01:04:17.050 --> 01:04:18.730]  but they're still there.
[01:04:18.730 --> 01:04:20.570]  So they're just heavy eaters,
[01:04:20.570 --> 01:04:21.530]  but that's the learning curve,
[01:04:21.530 --> 01:04:22.650]  like with growing a new strain.
[01:04:22.650 --> 01:04:24.090]  I've never grown a strain.
[01:04:24.090 --> 01:04:26.450]  You gotta learn, you're gonna mess up.
[01:04:26.450 --> 01:04:27.690]  Sometimes you hit it right on the head,
[01:04:27.690 --> 01:04:29.890]  like with the Lemon Garlic OG,
[01:04:29.890 --> 01:04:32.450]  but that's, I don't know, maybe they,
[01:04:32.450 --> 01:04:34.010]  there's just something going on and they like more.
[01:04:34.010 --> 01:04:34.850]  I don't know.
[01:04:37.780 --> 01:04:39.980]  But that Blue Mat is just,
[01:04:39.980 --> 01:04:41.740]  I don't know how well you can tell.
[01:04:42.740 --> 01:04:48.450]  Those were on the Blue Mat and those weren't.
[01:04:49.370 --> 01:04:52.930]  Like just everything bigger, the thickness of the stalk.
[01:05:03.610 --> 01:05:06.610]  But you can tell just by where the lights are, how, you know.
[01:05:07.690 --> 01:05:09.370]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:05:10.970 --> 01:05:13.490]  And everything else was constant, right?
[01:05:13.490 --> 01:05:17.810]  Like it's the same, I mean, same lights, same soil,
[01:05:17.810 --> 01:05:21.010]  same everything, just one's hand watering
[01:05:21.610 --> 01:05:26.250]  and one's constant, perfect moisture levels
[01:05:26.250 --> 01:05:27.730]  for the microbes.
[01:05:27.730 --> 01:05:28.570]  Yes, sir.
[01:05:35.960 --> 01:05:40.960]  So what kind of, like that's kind of one,
[01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:42.680]  I don't know if it's an experiment
[01:05:42.680 --> 01:05:44.240]  or just something you're fucking around with,
[01:05:44.240 --> 01:05:47.160]  but like what other things are you kind of playing around
[01:05:47.160 --> 01:05:48.400]  with right now to?
[01:05:54.370 --> 01:05:55.890]  Mostly just stuff that I'm-
[01:05:55.890 --> 01:05:58.570]  What are you exploring and learning about right now?
[01:05:59.570 --> 01:06:02.650]  Oh, the, I forget his name,
[01:06:02.650 --> 01:06:05.890]  but the guy you had on with the rhizophagy cycle.
[01:06:05.890 --> 01:06:07.330]  James White, yeah.
[01:06:07.330 --> 01:06:08.650]  Dude, dude.
[01:06:11.950 --> 01:06:14.350]  That, you know, like that, like microbes.
[01:06:14.350 --> 01:06:16.710]  I'm always, it's always, you know, I'll get in,
[01:06:16.710 --> 01:06:18.550]  like right now I'm into like first peoples
[01:06:18.550 --> 01:06:20.510]  and lost civilizations and weird shit, you know,
[01:06:20.510 --> 01:06:22.950]  but it always just comes back to the microbes.
[01:06:22.950 --> 01:06:24.630]  Like I'm always reading about microbes,
[01:06:24.630 --> 01:06:27.230]  I'm always trying to find the latest stuff about it.
[01:06:29.030 --> 01:06:30.590]  If I feel like that's where the answer lies,
[01:06:30.590 --> 01:06:33.030]  we're at for like literally everything.
[01:06:34.950 --> 01:06:38.230]  Yeah, I've talked to Brandon about-
[01:06:39.510 --> 01:06:41.110]  Oh, he was awesome too, man.
[01:06:41.110 --> 01:06:42.550]  I love that guy.
[01:06:42.550 --> 01:06:44.310]  I didn't even realize he got shadow, man.
[01:06:44.310 --> 01:06:46.670]  I've been following him and once I found that,
[01:06:46.670 --> 01:06:49.310]  I was like, oh yeah, I haven't been seeing him post a lot.
[01:06:49.310 --> 01:06:51.190]  Well, no, we had talked about, you know,
[01:06:51.230 --> 01:06:54.670]  he reads so much kind of plant science research
[01:06:54.670 --> 01:06:57.390]  and I was like, it'd be cool if just every week we went on
[01:06:57.390 --> 01:07:01.670]  and you gave everybody like the plain English translation
[01:07:01.670 --> 01:07:04.750]  of, you know, what like he-
[01:07:09.260 --> 01:07:10.420]  Yeah, that'd be awesome.
[01:07:10.420 --> 01:07:11.460]  I'd be down for that.
[01:07:12.340 --> 01:07:15.620]  You know, like he sends me stuff and it's like,
[01:07:16.740 --> 01:07:20.380]  this is biostimulant action of protein hydrolysates
[01:07:20.380 --> 01:07:23.980]  unraveling their effects on plant physiology and microbiome.
[01:07:25.020 --> 01:07:30.020]  By a bunch of Italian, yeah, Italian horticultural, yeah.
[01:07:36.180 --> 01:07:40.300]  So anyway, and then like the ideas, you know,
[01:07:40.300 --> 01:07:43.340]  we can get the actual people who wrote the papers
[01:07:43.340 --> 01:07:46.260]  to jump on with us and then we can just pepper them
[01:07:46.260 --> 01:07:47.580]  with questions and-
[01:07:47.580 --> 01:07:49.380]  Yeah, oh yeah.
[01:07:50.380 --> 01:07:53.700]  But so talk about, so you were,
[01:07:53.700 --> 01:07:56.380]  which branch of the military were you in?
[01:07:56.380 --> 01:07:57.980]  I was in the Marine Corps.
[01:07:57.980 --> 01:07:59.100]  And for how long?
[01:07:59.940 --> 01:08:03.420]  From 2011 to 2014.
[01:08:03.420 --> 01:08:07.580]  Okay, and in your local community,
[01:08:07.580 --> 01:08:11.100]  do you find kind of a lot of vets with like
[01:08:12.980 --> 01:08:14.980]  PTSD type issues?
[01:08:15.020 --> 01:08:20.020]  So that's, I wanna say yeah, but it's not like
[01:08:21.980 --> 01:08:24.660]  they're coming out and like, oh, hey, like I'm fucked up.
[01:08:24.660 --> 01:08:26.220]  You know, I got PTSD, I got problems.
[01:08:26.220 --> 01:08:30.500]  Like it's society, you know, like even at the VA and shit,
[01:08:30.500 --> 01:08:32.140]  it's just like, they're stubborn, man.
[01:08:32.140 --> 01:08:34.780]  It's like, they let ego get in the way.
[01:08:37.660 --> 01:08:40.300]  That's not good for anyone, you know, like, yeah,
[01:08:40.300 --> 01:08:42.220]  like, yeah, you know, just don't do the VA.
[01:08:42.340 --> 01:08:43.180]  I see it a lot.
[01:08:43.180 --> 01:08:44.740]  I got done in those group meetings and shit
[01:08:44.740 --> 01:08:46.100]  and the substance abuse stuff.
[01:08:46.100 --> 01:08:49.500]  And like, when I went to the group therapy,
[01:08:49.500 --> 01:08:52.260]  it's like, you know, I asked for individual therapy,
[01:08:52.260 --> 01:08:54.860]  but of course, like, nah, I can't do that.
[01:08:54.860 --> 01:08:56.180]  So I did the group stuff
[01:08:56.180 --> 01:08:57.740]  and it was just like a pissing contest.
[01:08:57.740 --> 01:09:00.620]  Like I showed up, it was like, I was in a bad place
[01:09:00.620 --> 01:09:03.660]  and I wanted to heal and talk about some shit.
[01:09:03.660 --> 01:09:06.700]  And these guys were just trying to have a pissing contest
[01:09:06.700 --> 01:09:08.180]  about like who went through the war.
[01:09:08.180 --> 01:09:09.460]  And I was like, I don't know,
[01:09:09.460 --> 01:09:10.300]  I don't know what's going on.
[01:09:10.300 --> 01:09:11.140]  And they were just having a pissing contest
[01:09:11.140 --> 01:09:12.780]  about like who went through the worst shit
[01:09:12.780 --> 01:09:14.740]  and who had like the worst time in the military
[01:09:14.740 --> 01:09:18.900]  or like whose experience was just ridiculous.
[01:09:21.260 --> 01:09:24.340]  Sorry, people are still talking about lights
[01:09:24.340 --> 01:09:27.740]  and caterpillars, even though we're
[01:09:27.740 --> 01:09:34.360]  on a totally different topic, but I think that was.
[01:09:42.560 --> 01:09:47.040]  Yeah, so earlier someone talked about they tried blue mats
[01:09:47.040 --> 01:09:51.240]  and then ripped them out and then Durbin Riff said,
[01:09:51.240 --> 01:09:54.000]  I think this is the important thing with blue mats.
[01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:57.360]  Like once you get it working,
[01:09:58.920 --> 01:10:01.560]  would you agree that they're pretty amazing?
[01:10:01.560 --> 01:10:03.400]  Yes, yes.
[01:10:03.400 --> 01:10:04.720]  And exactly what Scott says,
[01:10:04.720 --> 01:10:07.240]  like people want to talk shit because they put it in
[01:10:07.240 --> 01:10:09.760]  and they turn it like a volume knob and they talk it up
[01:10:09.760 --> 01:10:12.000]  and they don't want to point the finger at themselves.
[01:10:12.520 --> 01:10:13.640]  Oh, let's get a different water and see.
[01:10:13.640 --> 01:10:14.560]  Well, you didn't use it right.
[01:10:14.560 --> 01:10:16.920]  You messed up, that's all.
[01:10:16.920 --> 01:10:17.760]  Just do it right.
[01:10:18.880 --> 01:10:20.720]  They're just too quick to want to like point the finger
[01:10:20.720 --> 01:10:22.560]  at someone else and blame them for their fuck up.
[01:10:22.560 --> 01:10:25.040]  You know, like it's ridiculous.
[01:10:25.040 --> 01:10:26.440]  But yeah, no, once they're dialed in,
[01:10:26.440 --> 01:10:29.760]  it's, I do admit in the beginning, it's a little sketchy.
[01:10:30.600 --> 01:10:32.360]  It's because you're waiting for them to start running
[01:10:32.360 --> 01:10:34.760]  and shit, but once they do, it's over.
[01:10:35.680 --> 01:10:36.680]  You don't have to do anything.
[01:10:36.680 --> 01:10:38.400]  You're just training the plant, you know?
[01:10:38.400 --> 01:10:39.720]  You focus on other things.
[01:10:42.280 --> 01:10:47.280]  Sorry, I'm just posting your Instagram again
[01:10:48.240 --> 01:10:50.400]  so people, if they want to know,
[01:10:50.400 --> 01:10:52.160]  actually, you know what I can do?
[01:10:54.160 --> 01:10:55.160]  Hold on.
[01:10:58.140 --> 01:11:00.860]  Give me, actually, watch this.
[01:11:02.740 --> 01:11:05.300]  Give me one second.
[01:11:07.980 --> 01:11:09.060]  Look at that.
[01:11:09.060 --> 01:11:10.420]  There we go.
[01:11:10.420 --> 01:11:13.180]  That's who we're talking to right now.
[01:11:13.940 --> 01:11:14.780]  That's my,
[01:11:17.780 --> 01:11:19.540]  techno wizard over there.
[01:11:19.540 --> 01:11:24.540]  That's right, we got these pro video production tools.
[01:11:26.900 --> 01:11:28.940]  Sorry, somebody was just talking about
[01:11:30.700 --> 01:11:32.380]  Hemet province or something.
[01:11:36.940 --> 01:11:39.860]  I know, Hellman Valley Growers Club in San Diego,
[01:11:39.860 --> 01:11:41.420]  vets growing for vets.
[01:11:42.340 --> 01:11:43.180]  Hellman?
[01:11:45.780 --> 01:11:50.420]  Yeah, I don't know, did you watch the vet round table
[01:11:50.420 --> 01:11:52.380]  we did like a month ago?
[01:11:52.380 --> 01:11:54.060]  No, I haven't yet, no.
[01:11:55.780 --> 01:11:57.540]  I talked to my buddy about it
[01:11:57.540 --> 01:12:00.180]  because he's got some shit going on too
[01:12:00.180 --> 01:12:04.620]  and I woke up late, but he was trying to get in,
[01:12:04.620 --> 01:12:06.060]  and I know you guys were having problems
[01:12:06.060 --> 01:12:07.700]  and that's why I was like, oh, I'll just look at it later
[01:12:07.700 --> 01:12:09.660]  and I never got to it.
[01:12:09.660 --> 01:12:10.540]  Oh, right, that's right.
[01:12:10.540 --> 01:12:12.660]  I remember I couldn't go live with that one,
[01:12:12.660 --> 01:12:14.500]  so I just posted it like the next day.
[01:12:14.500 --> 01:12:16.820]  But I wanna do more of those
[01:12:16.820 --> 01:12:19.660]  and just bring kind of vets together to talk shop
[01:12:19.660 --> 01:12:21.220]  and about, because I think what you said,
[01:12:21.220 --> 01:12:23.140]  I don't think it's, I think it's pride.
[01:12:23.140 --> 01:12:26.900]  Like nobody, especially guys, right?
[01:12:26.900 --> 01:12:29.060]  Like guys don't wanna be like, I have a problem,
[01:12:29.060 --> 01:12:29.900]  I need help.
[01:12:31.780 --> 01:12:36.780]  And then interestingly, the VA system,
[01:12:37.300 --> 01:12:42.300]  I asked the former head of the VA,
[01:12:44.380 --> 01:12:48.540]  who's been outspoken and kind of critical about the VA,
[01:12:49.620 --> 01:12:51.180]  if he wants to come on.
[01:12:51.180 --> 01:12:54.500]  He's super busy right now, so I'm gonna ask him again.
[01:12:57.380 --> 01:12:59.340]  Give me a second, I'm looking up his...
[01:13:00.340 --> 01:13:07.060]  I'm totally blanking on it, my mind's fried right now.
[01:13:10.060 --> 01:13:11.740]  Yeah, David Shulkin,
[01:13:11.740 --> 01:13:15.740]  who is the former secretary, Department of Veteran Affairs.
[01:13:18.060 --> 01:13:20.220]  But he's been kind of critical,
[01:13:20.220 --> 01:13:21.820]  because the big thing is,
[01:13:23.260 --> 01:13:25.740]  it's like the same thing with pro athletes,
[01:13:25.740 --> 01:13:27.820]  where you know, you're like,
[01:13:27.860 --> 01:13:30.180]  it's like the same thing with pro athletes,
[01:13:30.180 --> 01:13:34.740]  where you can have all the prescription opiates
[01:13:34.740 --> 01:13:37.180]  that you can swallow,
[01:13:37.180 --> 01:13:40.740]  but God forbid you smoke some weed.
[01:13:42.860 --> 01:13:47.540]  Do you guys fear kind of the consequences
[01:13:47.540 --> 01:13:51.100]  if like you need services from the VA in Michigan,
[01:13:51.100 --> 01:13:53.260]  if they'd be like, you smoke weed?
[01:13:53.260 --> 01:13:57.460]  Like, we're sorry, like no seat for you.
[01:13:58.420 --> 01:14:00.180]  Well, I haven't been to the VA
[01:14:00.180 --> 01:14:02.300]  since I did that substance abuse shit.
[01:14:02.300 --> 01:14:04.340]  I've been sober for 16 months.
[01:14:04.340 --> 01:14:06.780]  So that was amazing the way that one was set up.
[01:14:06.780 --> 01:14:09.060]  But what was the question again?
[01:14:09.060 --> 01:14:09.900]  I'm sorry.
[01:14:11.140 --> 01:14:13.980]  Just if people feared the VA,
[01:14:13.980 --> 01:14:15.460]  like if you walked in there
[01:14:15.460 --> 01:14:19.340]  and you still needed stuff from the VA,
[01:14:20.220 --> 01:14:23.420]  would you fear them finding out that you smoke weed?
[01:14:24.140 --> 01:14:29.140]  Um, no, because when I go there,
[01:14:29.620 --> 01:14:30.740]  it's like a forced thing,
[01:14:30.740 --> 01:14:32.900]  because I know how like fucky it is.
[01:14:32.900 --> 01:14:33.900]  And I've been through the ringer
[01:14:33.900 --> 01:14:35.060]  and I've seen the shit they do,
[01:14:35.060 --> 01:14:40.060]  but they're saving grace is the case managers,
[01:14:40.180 --> 01:14:41.820]  like the social workers.
[01:14:41.820 --> 01:14:43.220]  It seems like they're the only people
[01:14:43.220 --> 01:14:44.820]  that are there to like help you.
[01:14:44.820 --> 01:14:46.540]  Like they'll call you on the weekend and shit
[01:14:46.540 --> 01:14:48.020]  and be like, oh, hey, we got this new class.
[01:14:48.020 --> 01:14:49.340]  Like I thought I could help you, you know,
[01:14:49.340 --> 01:14:50.620]  like that type of shit.
[01:14:50.660 --> 01:14:51.820]  But as far as like going in there
[01:14:51.820 --> 01:14:53.500]  to see the docs and stuff,
[01:14:53.500 --> 01:14:54.580]  like I know all they're gonna do,
[01:14:54.580 --> 01:14:56.540]  like, for example, when I went,
[01:14:56.540 --> 01:14:57.620]  when I first got out,
[01:14:59.900 --> 01:15:00.740]  what do they call it?
[01:15:00.740 --> 01:15:03.500]  Initial, what I like the first time to see a doc.
[01:15:03.500 --> 01:15:04.340]  So they're like, yeah,
[01:15:04.340 --> 01:15:08.660]  bring like your list of like your top problems and stuff.
[01:15:08.660 --> 01:15:09.500]  So I was like, all right.
[01:15:09.500 --> 01:15:11.740]  So I had a list of like fucking 10 things, you know,
[01:15:11.740 --> 01:15:14.260]  and like the worst ones at the top,
[01:15:14.260 --> 01:15:18.660]  I think it was like anxiety and headaches
[01:15:18.660 --> 01:15:20.020]  or something like that.
[01:15:20.460 --> 01:15:21.300]  And so like they take the list
[01:15:21.300 --> 01:15:22.940]  and it's like, so like,
[01:15:22.940 --> 01:15:26.500]  first of all, it's like in person, like totally.
[01:15:26.500 --> 01:15:28.500]  It's like they're removed.
[01:15:30.060 --> 01:15:31.060]  So she like addressed,
[01:15:31.060 --> 01:15:33.020]  she's like, oh, well, this is like too many to go,
[01:15:33.020 --> 01:15:33.860]  which I understood,
[01:15:33.860 --> 01:15:35.700]  like too many to go over and wanna point at.
[01:15:35.700 --> 01:15:37.060]  So like, which ones are your worst ones?
[01:15:37.060 --> 01:15:38.180]  So I pointed them out.
[01:15:38.180 --> 01:15:39.620]  And it was like, oh, well,
[01:15:39.620 --> 01:15:41.540]  like she wrote me a script for two drugs,
[01:15:41.540 --> 01:15:44.180]  like, you know, something like whatever.
[01:15:44.180 --> 01:15:47.540]  And then she's like, I'd seen her,
[01:15:47.540 --> 01:15:49.100]  it was ridiculous.
[01:15:49.100 --> 01:15:49.940]  And then she's like,
[01:15:49.940 --> 01:15:53.220]  we're gonna send you over to the psych guy,
[01:15:53.220 --> 01:15:54.060]  the psychologist,
[01:15:54.060 --> 01:15:55.820]  so I go over there.
[01:15:55.820 --> 01:15:58.740]  The whole time she does not look at me one time.
[01:15:58.740 --> 01:16:01.580]  And like, you're in a bone,
[01:16:01.580 --> 01:16:03.860]  like you know how much it took me to even get up
[01:16:03.860 --> 01:16:06.780]  and go in there to do what I was doing, you know?
[01:16:06.780 --> 01:16:08.780]  And then like those people act that way.
[01:16:09.900 --> 01:16:11.620]  And so she doesn't look at me the whole time,
[01:16:11.620 --> 01:16:12.460]  she's just like, whatever,
[01:16:12.460 --> 01:16:13.300]  all you got, bye.
[01:16:13.300 --> 01:16:14.140]  And then at the end,
[01:16:14.140 --> 01:16:15.460]  you know, if you ever think about hurting yourself,
[01:16:15.460 --> 01:16:17.380]  and I was like, yeah.
[01:16:17.420 --> 01:16:18.260]  And she was like,
[01:16:18.260 --> 01:16:20.700]  she's looking at me and fucking grabbed a magnet
[01:16:20.700 --> 01:16:23.700]  off of her little fucking filing cabinet shit
[01:16:23.700 --> 01:16:24.540]  and handed it to me.
[01:16:24.540 --> 01:16:26.980]  And I had like the fucking suicide hotline on it
[01:16:26.980 --> 01:16:28.620]  and like a couple other numbers
[01:16:28.620 --> 01:16:30.340]  and like sent me on my fucking way.
[01:16:30.340 --> 01:16:33.780]  And I was like, all right, ridiculous.
[01:16:36.140 --> 01:16:39.060]  So for just like fear of like not being taken serious
[01:16:39.060 --> 01:16:41.100]  and like when you got to like suck up all your pride
[01:16:41.100 --> 01:16:43.100]  and shit to even go in there in the first fucking place.
[01:16:43.100 --> 01:16:44.660]  And then literally everybody in there
[01:16:44.700 --> 01:16:47.620]  was the most disgruntled, like hateful motherfucker.
[01:16:47.620 --> 01:16:50.140]  It's like, like I went there to fucking heal
[01:16:50.140 --> 01:16:51.660]  and it wasn't a place of healing.
[01:16:51.660 --> 01:16:53.300]  It was a place of prescription drugs
[01:16:53.300 --> 01:16:56.060]  and fucking disgruntled like people.
[01:16:57.500 --> 01:16:59.500]  Not a place to heal.
[01:16:59.500 --> 01:17:00.340]  Right.
[01:17:01.620 --> 01:17:05.500]  All right, well, it's actually,
[01:17:05.500 --> 01:17:06.540]  you're three hours ahead.
[01:17:06.540 --> 01:17:08.620]  It's 1020 in the AM here,
[01:17:08.620 --> 01:17:11.420]  but I wanted to, I've been meaning to like,
[01:17:11.420 --> 01:17:13.220]  I mean, when I first reached out to you,
[01:17:13.220 --> 01:17:15.860]  that was what, like six months ago, eight months ago,
[01:17:15.860 --> 01:17:18.900]  to be like, you wanna like just walk around and film shit.
[01:17:18.900 --> 01:17:21.380]  And so we finally started
[01:17:21.380 --> 01:17:25.220]  and I think we can revisit you regularly,
[01:17:25.220 --> 01:17:30.220]  but I'll talk to the guys from Rosin Evolution
[01:17:31.460 --> 01:17:33.140]  to see if they can get you a,
[01:17:34.500 --> 01:17:38.740]  the five gallon to start making some medicine with.
[01:17:38.740 --> 01:17:39.580]  Thanks man.
[01:17:39.580 --> 01:17:41.220]  That's why I love this community.
[01:17:41.220 --> 01:17:42.660]  Like I say it all the time to my girl,
[01:17:43.500 --> 01:17:44.340]  like someone will hit me up
[01:17:44.340 --> 01:17:47.020]  and we'll have a conversation like that's personal and shit.
[01:17:47.020 --> 01:17:48.820]  Like I don't even know these people
[01:17:48.820 --> 01:17:51.660]  and I'm just like crying to my girl.
[01:17:51.660 --> 01:17:53.220]  This is beautiful.
[01:17:53.220 --> 01:17:54.580]  You're having a conversation
[01:17:54.580 --> 01:17:57.060]  with 300 of your closest friends right now.
[01:18:00.380 --> 01:18:04.020]  We got people tuning in from Scandinavia.
[01:18:05.580 --> 01:18:07.060]  Where else are people?
[01:18:08.060 --> 01:18:08.900]  Scandinavia.
[01:18:08.900 --> 01:18:12.580]  And people have started posting where you are right now.
[01:18:14.740 --> 01:18:15.580]  That's crazy.
[01:18:15.580 --> 01:18:18.180]  Yeah, so this guy, yeah,
[01:18:18.180 --> 01:18:20.660]  I think that's a common theme with the VA.
[01:18:25.050 --> 01:18:26.130]  Yeah, definitely.
[01:18:26.130 --> 01:18:30.810]  Like they put me on Paxil,
[01:18:30.810 --> 01:18:34.650]  fucking, it's like a generic version of Zoloft.
[01:18:34.650 --> 01:18:37.650]  You know, I was on, fuck dude, I was on a lot of shit, man.
[01:18:38.090 --> 01:18:41.010]  My mom brought over my pillbox the other day
[01:18:41.010 --> 01:18:43.930]  and I was just like, Jesus Christ, I can't believe.
[01:18:46.290 --> 01:18:48.730]  I've been through some rough shit in my head.
[01:18:49.810 --> 01:18:51.450]  But the Paxil just kind of like,
[01:18:53.090 --> 01:18:55.210]  that was the closest I've ever been to killing myself
[01:18:55.210 --> 01:18:57.050]  was on the Paxil.
[01:18:59.650 --> 01:19:02.410]  Sorry, that's an antidepressant or what is that?
[01:19:02.410 --> 01:19:04.210]  Yeah, yeah, it's just like Zoloft.
[01:19:05.210 --> 01:19:07.650]  And I remember like being reluctant about it
[01:19:07.650 --> 01:19:09.850]  and then just like, so I was like, man,
[01:19:09.850 --> 01:19:12.090]  I don't wanna like turn into like an emotionless zombie,
[01:19:12.090 --> 01:19:12.930]  you know?
[01:19:15.330 --> 01:19:19.890]  But yeah, they had me on Bucephar, Bucepharone, fucking.
[01:19:23.090 --> 01:19:25.290]  I don't know if I ever got prescribed Xanax.
[01:19:25.290 --> 01:19:28.410]  I think that's, I'm not sure, just tons of shit.
[01:19:28.410 --> 01:19:30.450]  But the Paxil, they didn't tell me like,
[01:19:30.450 --> 01:19:32.570]  hey, you can't stop a cold turkey if you wanna get off it,
[01:19:33.130 --> 01:19:35.050]  you gotta wean off of it type of shit.
[01:19:35.050 --> 01:19:37.050]  Luckily I had a sister that was a PA.
[01:19:38.490 --> 01:19:41.330]  So me and my girl went down and visited my sister
[01:19:41.330 --> 01:19:44.210]  in North Carolina and I didn't bring the Paxil
[01:19:44.210 --> 01:19:46.610]  because I was like, whatever, fuck it, I don't need it.
[01:19:46.610 --> 01:19:48.730]  So I get down there after a 12 hour drive
[01:19:48.730 --> 01:19:51.170]  and I'm like buzzing and I think it's from the drive,
[01:19:51.170 --> 01:19:52.370]  you know?
[01:19:52.370 --> 01:19:57.170]  And fucking, I started getting these like ups and downs,
[01:19:57.170 --> 01:19:58.650]  like crazy, dude.
[01:19:58.650 --> 01:20:00.690]  Like once I get, I'll like literally be thinking
[01:20:00.690 --> 01:20:02.370]  about like killing somebody.
[01:20:03.130 --> 01:20:03.970]  Like mad, angry.
[01:20:03.970 --> 01:20:07.330]  The next I'm like holding back tears, nothing's in my head.
[01:20:07.330 --> 01:20:10.690]  Like, and then these buzzes through my body,
[01:20:10.690 --> 01:20:13.250]  like a literal, you know, the fake handshaking,
[01:20:13.250 --> 01:20:14.970]  touching, but this isn't like, ooh.
[01:20:14.970 --> 01:20:16.530]  It's like that through my whole body,
[01:20:16.530 --> 01:20:17.730]  from my head to my toes.
[01:20:19.370 --> 01:20:21.570]  And I was like freaking out.
[01:20:21.570 --> 01:20:23.250]  And I was talking to my sister
[01:20:23.250 --> 01:20:24.090]  because I was down seeing her,
[01:20:24.090 --> 01:20:26.090]  she's a physician assistant.
[01:20:26.090 --> 01:20:28.890]  And she was like, did you bring your Paxil?
[01:20:28.890 --> 01:20:29.730]  I'm like, no.
[01:20:29.730 --> 01:20:30.890]  And she was like, you're a fucking idiot.
[01:20:30.930 --> 01:20:32.090]  And I was like, what do you mean?
[01:20:32.090 --> 01:20:33.690]  No, like they didn't tell me.
[01:20:33.690 --> 01:20:35.570]  So I had to call in a prescription down there
[01:20:35.570 --> 01:20:36.770]  and take the Paxil and shit.
[01:20:36.770 --> 01:20:39.250]  And from, I was like, I'm getting off of this shit.
[01:20:39.250 --> 01:20:40.410]  There's no way.
[01:20:40.410 --> 01:20:41.610]  And like, there was some other shit
[01:20:41.610 --> 01:20:42.690]  that happened on the trip too,
[01:20:42.690 --> 01:20:44.770]  that was like not good.
[01:20:44.770 --> 01:20:45.890]  And it's that damn Paxil.
[01:20:45.890 --> 01:20:47.090]  I'm not talking to my dad.
[01:20:47.090 --> 01:20:51.010]  My dad is an army vet.
[01:20:51.010 --> 01:20:53.210]  And he was on Paxil around the time
[01:20:53.210 --> 01:20:54.970]  him and my mom got divorced.
[01:20:54.970 --> 01:20:56.210]  And I hadn't even told him anything
[01:20:56.210 --> 01:20:57.650]  about my Paxil experience.
[01:20:57.650 --> 01:20:59.850]  And he started telling me the same symptoms,
[01:20:59.850 --> 01:21:01.170]  same exact symptoms.
[01:21:01.170 --> 01:21:02.490]  And I was like, yeah, let me guess,
[01:21:02.490 --> 01:21:03.330]  you were drinking on it.
[01:21:03.330 --> 01:21:04.810]  And he's like, oh yeah, I'm like, dad,
[01:21:04.810 --> 01:21:08.250]  but no, like these drugs,
[01:21:08.250 --> 01:21:10.370]  they're not the way.
[01:21:12.130 --> 01:21:13.170]  It might help some people,
[01:21:13.170 --> 01:21:15.090]  but it's taking care of a symptom,
[01:21:15.090 --> 01:21:16.970]  not the cause, you know what I mean?
[01:21:18.610 --> 01:21:21.410]  And so now you're not using any of that stuff?
[01:21:21.410 --> 01:21:23.210]  No, mushrooms, man.
[01:21:23.210 --> 01:21:24.210]  Yeah, all right.
[01:21:24.210 --> 01:21:27.050]  So talk about, are you growing them yourself?
[01:21:27.050 --> 01:21:29.050]  Yeah, I wish.
[01:21:29.090 --> 01:21:29.930]  It was like a week ago,
[01:21:29.930 --> 01:21:31.490]  I had one growing in my,
[01:21:31.490 --> 01:21:32.890]  so my buddy, he grows them,
[01:21:32.890 --> 01:21:34.290]  like in tubs and stuff.
[01:21:34.290 --> 01:21:35.130]  And every once in a while,
[01:21:35.130 --> 01:21:37.890]  he'll have an extra little mason jar inoculated.
[01:21:37.890 --> 01:21:38.730]  And he'll give it to me,
[01:21:38.730 --> 01:21:41.130]  and I'll just keep it until I chop a plant down.
[01:21:41.130 --> 01:21:43.530]  And I'll dig a little trench in the bed,
[01:21:43.530 --> 01:21:45.730]  and I'll break up my celium in the jar.
[01:21:45.730 --> 01:21:47.410]  I'll put it in my, you don't get a lot,
[01:21:47.410 --> 01:21:49.770]  you know, there's not like the perfect conditions
[01:21:49.770 --> 01:21:52.890]  for bounties of mushrooms to be flushing.
[01:21:52.890 --> 01:21:53.890]  But I'll get mushrooms,
[01:21:53.890 --> 01:21:56.450]  like psychedelic mushrooms grown with my cannabis.
[01:21:56.450 --> 01:21:58.210]  And I picked one that was probably like
[01:21:58.210 --> 01:22:00.210]  seven inches long.
[01:22:00.210 --> 01:22:01.050]  Didn't even eat it,
[01:22:01.050 --> 01:22:02.530]  just ecstatic that it grew, you know,
[01:22:02.530 --> 01:22:04.970]  I just held it, appreciated it,
[01:22:04.970 --> 01:22:06.930]  thanked it for everything it's done for me, you know.
[01:22:06.930 --> 01:22:08.450]  Not even psychedelic mushrooms,
[01:22:08.450 --> 01:22:11.210]  like medicinal mushrooms as well,
[01:22:11.210 --> 01:22:12.690]  like the agaricon mushrooms.
[01:22:13.850 --> 01:22:16.770]  Changed my life, changed my life, hands down.
[01:22:16.770 --> 01:22:19.050]  So I have herpes in my eye,
[01:22:19.050 --> 01:22:20.810]  and I have like shingles and stuff.
[01:22:22.010 --> 01:22:24.170]  So if it's come out of my eye,
[01:22:24.170 --> 01:22:25.210]  you know, five, six times,
[01:22:25.210 --> 01:22:27.570]  I have like six scars on my cornea.
[01:22:28.210 --> 01:22:30.850]  Actually, when I got out of the Marine Corps,
[01:22:30.850 --> 01:22:33.090]  I knew I made a mistake, tried to join back.
[01:22:33.090 --> 01:22:34.690]  They wouldn't take me because they were cut numbers.
[01:22:34.690 --> 01:22:36.090]  So I joined the Army.
[01:22:36.090 --> 01:22:37.690]  Army took me, I went to bootcamp,
[01:22:37.690 --> 01:22:39.890]  and the herpes came out on my face.
[01:22:39.890 --> 01:22:41.530]  So I went to medical.
[01:22:41.530 --> 01:22:42.650]  When I went to medical,
[01:22:42.650 --> 01:22:43.490]  the doc was like,
[01:22:43.490 --> 01:22:44.890]  hey, we're gonna send you to the eye doc
[01:22:44.890 --> 01:22:45.890]  to make sure it's not in your eye.
[01:22:45.890 --> 01:22:47.930]  Well, I already knew it was in my eye at this point.
[01:22:47.930 --> 01:22:49.650]  So I'm like, oh no, no, no.
[01:22:49.650 --> 01:22:51.250]  So he's like, no, like it's serious.
[01:22:51.250 --> 01:22:52.090]  Like you gotta, you know,
[01:22:52.090 --> 01:22:52.930]  and I was like, fuck.
[01:22:52.930 --> 01:22:53.970]  So I go see the eye doc.
[01:22:54.970 --> 01:22:58.370]  Oh yeah, lines went 200% for my 2B eye.
[01:22:58.370 --> 01:23:00.770]  But so I saw the eye doc.
[01:23:00.770 --> 01:23:02.170]  She takes one look at my eye
[01:23:02.170 --> 01:23:04.050]  and I remember she looked through the little thing
[01:23:04.050 --> 01:23:05.050]  in my eye, she goes,
[01:23:05.930 --> 01:23:07.250]  and looks at me and looks back.
[01:23:07.250 --> 01:23:08.890]  And I'm like, ah, fuck.
[01:23:08.890 --> 01:23:10.890]  She's like, you got six scars on your cornea.
[01:23:10.890 --> 01:23:12.930]  Like fucking, you got herpes, blah, blah, blah.
[01:23:12.930 --> 01:23:14.010]  Like we're sending you home.
[01:23:14.010 --> 01:23:15.090]  I was like, no.
[01:23:15.090 --> 01:23:16.690]  She was like, yeah, like you can go blind
[01:23:16.690 --> 01:23:19.050]  if it comes out in the right spot.
[01:23:19.050 --> 01:23:20.930]  And so that's where my fucking journey ended.
[01:23:21.130 --> 01:23:24.810]  But so I found Paul Stamets shortly
[01:23:24.810 --> 01:23:28.970]  after I got out of the army on the Joe Rogan podcast.
[01:23:28.970 --> 01:23:30.290]  All I had to do was listen, you know,
[01:23:30.290 --> 01:23:32.530]  like I've shown plenty of people that they,
[01:23:32.530 --> 01:23:34.570]  you know, just changed my life.
[01:23:34.570 --> 01:23:36.650]  So I got his book.
[01:23:36.650 --> 01:23:40.410]  I saw his charts and stuff about like types of things
[01:23:40.410 --> 01:23:44.290]  that these certain mushrooms can fight against and stuff.
[01:23:44.290 --> 01:23:45.210]  And I'm reading through the chart.
[01:23:45.210 --> 01:23:46.050]  I'm like, oh, cool.
[01:23:46.050 --> 01:23:50.130]  I guess that, you know, and I see herpes and I go, what?
[01:23:50.170 --> 01:23:51.010]  Find the agaric.
[01:23:51.010 --> 01:23:54.770]  At this point, I'm on 500 milligrams of Velcyclovir
[01:23:54.770 --> 01:23:56.410]  or whatever, the antiviral.
[01:23:57.450 --> 01:24:00.090]  And that being said, we don't even know
[01:24:00.090 --> 01:24:01.410]  what our microbiome is.
[01:24:01.410 --> 01:24:03.610]  Like we know we have a microbiome and shit
[01:24:03.610 --> 01:24:05.690]  and like antibiotics are bad for that.
[01:24:05.690 --> 01:24:07.530]  We're finding that out now.
[01:24:07.530 --> 01:24:08.930]  But we have a microbiome.
[01:24:08.930 --> 01:24:12.330]  So now I'm thinking like that's 10 times more intricate
[01:24:12.330 --> 01:24:14.970]  and complex as the fucking, as your microbiome.
[01:24:15.970 --> 01:24:20.250]  So anyway, I was on 500 milligrams of that a day
[01:24:20.250 --> 01:24:22.610]  and the herpes was still coming out on my face.
[01:24:22.610 --> 01:24:25.570]  Luckily not my eye, but my face like once,
[01:24:25.570 --> 01:24:28.330]  twice a month stress, sunlight, lack of sleep.
[01:24:28.330 --> 01:24:30.770]  That's my whole entire life, you know, like,
[01:24:30.770 --> 01:24:32.610]  so it's cropping out all the time.
[01:24:32.610 --> 01:24:33.450]  It's just miserable.
[01:24:33.450 --> 01:24:35.730]  It shuts me down for like two weeks.
[01:24:35.730 --> 01:24:39.050]  So I found out about the agaricon.
[01:24:39.050 --> 01:24:43.010]  I literally dropped the Velcyclovir or asyphilvir
[01:24:43.370 --> 01:24:45.770]  or whatever, dropped it totally.
[01:24:45.770 --> 01:24:48.170]  And just picked up the agaricon and I can,
[01:24:49.330 --> 01:24:52.610]  maybe once a year, maybe once a year.
[01:24:52.610 --> 01:24:54.090]  My stress levels are the same.
[01:24:54.090 --> 01:24:56.930]  I get the same blight, same lack of sleep,
[01:24:56.930 --> 01:24:59.250]  you know, a couple hours a night.
[01:24:59.250 --> 01:25:01.850]  And it just doesn't crop up.
[01:25:03.010 --> 01:25:03.850]  It's amazing.
[01:25:05.530 --> 01:25:07.490]  Blinds man for the traumatic brain injury
[01:25:07.490 --> 01:25:08.570]  when I got blown up.
[01:25:09.970 --> 01:25:11.250]  That's awesome.
[01:25:11.250 --> 01:25:14.010]  Psychedelics were healing my spirit
[01:25:14.010 --> 01:25:16.250]  and just making me a better person.
[01:25:16.250 --> 01:25:18.850]  Where did that happen?
[01:25:18.850 --> 01:25:20.450]  I was blown up in Afghanistan.
[01:25:20.450 --> 01:25:24.530]  I hit a 250 pound IED two weeks before we came home,
[01:25:24.530 --> 01:25:25.930]  you know, of course.
[01:25:28.290 --> 01:25:36.170]  But actually, this is a piece of the bomb
[01:25:38.610 --> 01:25:41.970]  that the EOD tag, the explosive ordnance disposal guy.
[01:25:42.970 --> 01:25:44.930]  He brought me to the truck after we got smoked
[01:25:44.930 --> 01:25:47.130]  and like two of my buddies got flown out.
[01:25:47.130 --> 01:25:49.650]  They got Purple Hearts and me and the other guy,
[01:25:49.650 --> 01:25:51.330]  we had to stay behind.
[01:25:51.330 --> 01:25:54.570]  So I was like, just sitting there looking at my truck,
[01:25:54.570 --> 01:25:56.130]  flipped over all jacked up and shit
[01:25:56.130 --> 01:25:58.290]  while I'm trying to flip that shit back.
[01:25:58.290 --> 01:26:02.170]  And thanks for paying your taxes, man.
[01:26:02.170 --> 01:26:07.170]  But, fucking, yeah, it was an experience, man.
[01:26:07.930 --> 01:26:12.930]  And just like the time dilation when it first went off,
[01:26:13.130 --> 01:26:16.890]  like the sound, dude, like, that shit's wild.
[01:26:16.890 --> 01:26:17.730]  And that makes you think,
[01:26:17.730 --> 01:26:19.810]  because people get in car wrecks all the time and stuff.
[01:26:19.810 --> 01:26:21.530]  Like, oh yeah, time slowed down.
[01:26:21.530 --> 01:26:22.370]  And like, you know,
[01:26:22.370 --> 01:26:23.570]  they might not think about it that much,
[01:26:23.570 --> 01:26:26.810]  but that shit like really piqued my interest.
[01:26:26.810 --> 01:26:29.450]  Like I could see the dust, like we got hit.
[01:26:29.450 --> 01:26:32.850]  So he ran 700 meters of debt for it.
[01:26:32.850 --> 01:26:34.770]  And if anyone knows like electricity,
[01:26:34.770 --> 01:26:36.090]  you know there's resistance.
[01:26:36.130 --> 01:26:37.450]  So there's 700 meters of wire
[01:26:37.450 --> 01:26:39.690]  from where this guy was holding the detonator
[01:26:39.690 --> 01:26:43.210]  to where the bomb was in the road where we were driving.
[01:26:43.210 --> 01:26:46.370]  And so they got a little aiming stick out in the desert.
[01:26:46.370 --> 01:26:48.250]  So where he's at, there's an aiming stick
[01:26:48.250 --> 01:26:50.730]  between where the bomb is and where he's at.
[01:26:50.730 --> 01:26:52.770]  So when the truck hits the aiming stick,
[01:26:52.770 --> 01:26:54.810]  they detonate it and it blows up.
[01:26:54.810 --> 01:26:57.450]  And that's how they aim the device.
[01:26:58.610 --> 01:27:00.610]  And so when he blew it,
[01:27:00.610 --> 01:27:02.330]  he blew it when it was directly under our truck,
[01:27:02.330 --> 01:27:03.170]  like we were coming over,
[01:27:03.690 --> 01:27:05.770]  if this is the bomb coming over like this
[01:27:05.770 --> 01:27:08.770]  and he blew it here, but because of the resistance,
[01:27:08.770 --> 01:27:10.730]  it didn't blow until a split second later.
[01:27:10.730 --> 01:27:12.530]  So it blew in the back of the truck,
[01:27:12.530 --> 01:27:15.010]  took us on our front end and then slammed us on the side
[01:27:15.010 --> 01:27:16.610]  of 60,000 pound truck.
[01:27:17.730 --> 01:27:20.690]  And I remember it was like, boom,
[01:27:20.690 --> 01:27:22.290]  and like going up and look like,
[01:27:22.290 --> 01:27:25.250]  like looking at the ground and all the fucking sand
[01:27:25.250 --> 01:27:27.530]  and dust and dirt from the whole deployment and shit
[01:27:27.530 --> 01:27:30.170]  and the floorboards just slowly blasted
[01:27:30.170 --> 01:27:32.010]  and I could see my gun floating.
[01:27:32.010 --> 01:27:34.130]  I could see snacks and shit we had floating.
[01:27:34.130 --> 01:27:35.450]  What was that like?
[01:27:35.450 --> 01:27:38.970]  I mean, you're describing it like it's in slow motion,
[01:27:38.970 --> 01:27:40.810]  even though it's like a split second
[01:27:40.810 --> 01:27:42.850]  and you remember every little,
[01:27:42.850 --> 01:27:46.570]  like you remember like the bird that flew by the window
[01:27:46.570 --> 01:27:47.410]  and like.
[01:27:47.410 --> 01:27:49.530]  Yeah, Pop-Tart floating our snack,
[01:27:49.530 --> 01:27:51.450]  we call it class one, our snacks.
[01:27:51.450 --> 01:27:54.130]  So all that we had sitting between, I was the driver.
[01:27:54.130 --> 01:27:56.970]  So I remember like, I remember like,
[01:27:57.090 --> 01:27:59.730]  so all that we had sitting between, I was the driver.
[01:27:59.730 --> 01:28:03.530]  So between me and the A driver, the guy riding shotgun,
[01:28:03.530 --> 01:28:04.850]  we had our two weapons sitting there,
[01:28:04.850 --> 01:28:06.330]  our snacks and shit like that.
[01:28:07.490 --> 01:28:09.450]  So yeah, when we got hit the most,
[01:28:09.450 --> 01:28:11.730]  it was the sand, cause the sand is on the floorboards.
[01:28:11.730 --> 01:28:13.690]  So we got hit and ejected up,
[01:28:13.690 --> 01:28:15.850]  but it was like blacking out slow motion.
[01:28:15.850 --> 01:28:18.250]  It's like the sand coming from the floorboards,
[01:28:18.250 --> 01:28:19.810]  just blacking everything out.
[01:28:20.690 --> 01:28:24.610]  And then we fucking hit the ground and I blacked out
[01:28:24.610 --> 01:28:26.370]  and I remember waking up and I was just,
[01:28:26.730 --> 01:28:27.730]  cause we landed on the driver's side.
[01:28:27.730 --> 01:28:29.850]  So all that shit that was in the air landed on me,
[01:28:29.850 --> 01:28:31.290]  like the guns and everything.
[01:28:32.170 --> 01:28:34.890]  I woke up and I remember I was totally content.
[01:28:34.890 --> 01:28:36.490]  I was like, I thought I was at home.
[01:28:36.490 --> 01:28:38.530]  I was sleeping, I was like, huh?
[01:28:38.530 --> 01:28:41.250]  And I hear my buddy, fuck, fuck.
[01:28:41.250 --> 01:28:42.850]  I just snapped into it,
[01:28:42.850 --> 01:28:45.170]  neuro count, adrenaline, boom.
[01:28:45.170 --> 01:28:46.410]  And I'm just in it, you know,
[01:28:46.410 --> 01:28:49.130]  there's like nothing like that,
[01:28:49.130 --> 01:28:51.450]  ever fucking nothing like that.
[01:28:51.450 --> 01:28:54.570]  And so I'm just like suited at this point,
[01:28:54.570 --> 01:28:56.210]  I'm checking everybody.
[01:28:57.050 --> 01:28:58.330]  My A driver, he's like holding his arm,
[01:28:58.330 --> 01:29:00.690]  his fucking nose is bleeding and shit.
[01:29:00.690 --> 01:29:01.690]  I check him, he's good.
[01:29:01.690 --> 01:29:04.730]  So I go to the back, we got our JTAC,
[01:29:04.730 --> 01:29:06.490]  who's the guy that controls the aircraft.
[01:29:06.490 --> 01:29:07.690]  He's the one that's talking to the birds
[01:29:07.690 --> 01:29:09.130]  to drop bombs and shit.
[01:29:09.130 --> 01:29:10.330]  He's knocked out.
[01:29:10.330 --> 01:29:12.330]  I'm on top of him fucking shaking him.
[01:29:13.370 --> 01:29:16.650]  Sensor Jones, sensor Jones, fucking wakes up.
[01:29:16.650 --> 01:29:19.730]  I'm like, oh fuck, I get like this rush of relief over me.
[01:29:19.730 --> 01:29:22.090]  And then my gunner kill us.
[01:29:22.090 --> 01:29:25.810]  So like the gun turret is on the top of the truck,
[01:29:26.450 --> 01:29:28.290]  so you got to stand on the gunner stand.
[01:29:28.290 --> 01:29:30.130]  And the gunner stand is maybe like two feet.
[01:29:30.130 --> 01:29:31.530]  So the gunner steps up on the stand
[01:29:31.530 --> 01:29:33.250]  and then can get up on the 50 cal.
[01:29:34.210 --> 01:29:39.210]  And fucking, so the gunner has a harness on his whole body
[01:29:39.650 --> 01:29:43.730]  and it has a little dangly strap on the bottom.
[01:29:43.730 --> 01:29:45.490]  And like that hangs by your crotch.
[01:29:45.490 --> 01:29:47.890]  And there's a seatbelt that comes from the stand
[01:29:47.890 --> 01:29:49.770]  that goes up and hooks.
[01:29:49.770 --> 01:29:52.930]  So if you get hit, it doesn't eject you from the truck.
[01:29:52.930 --> 01:29:55.610]  It locks like a seatbelt and keeps you inside the truck.
[01:29:56.650 --> 01:30:00.570]  Well, we got hit so fucking hard
[01:30:00.570 --> 01:30:01.810]  that the seatbelt didn't lock
[01:30:01.810 --> 01:30:04.330]  until Phillips was out of the fucking truck.
[01:30:04.330 --> 01:30:06.810]  So when I'm checking Jones, like the truck's on its side,
[01:30:06.810 --> 01:30:08.130]  the turret is now to my left.
[01:30:08.130 --> 01:30:09.770]  Like I'm hunched over and if I look left,
[01:30:09.770 --> 01:30:13.050]  I can see the turret, you know, it's around the side.
[01:30:13.050 --> 01:30:16.170]  And so Jones is getting that look,
[01:30:16.170 --> 01:30:18.170]  the turret's closed and Phillips ain't there.
[01:30:18.170 --> 01:30:20.530]  And I'm like, ah, fuck, dude.
[01:30:21.690 --> 01:30:24.650]  So I'm like, I don't want to open that fucking door.
[01:30:24.690 --> 01:30:27.010]  And I'm like, Phillips.
[01:30:27.010 --> 01:30:28.210]  I'm screaming his fucking name.
[01:30:28.210 --> 01:30:29.050]  He's not answering me.
[01:30:29.050 --> 01:30:30.490]  I'm like, ah, fuck.
[01:30:30.490 --> 01:30:35.290]  So I fucking push open the turret like real slow.
[01:30:35.290 --> 01:30:38.010]  He's sitting there, like basically
[01:30:38.010 --> 01:30:39.090]  like he's doing a toe touch.
[01:30:39.090 --> 01:30:40.690]  Like he's on his butt and he's got his head
[01:30:40.690 --> 01:30:42.610]  like between his legs.
[01:30:42.610 --> 01:30:45.650]  I fucking, I grabbed him and I like unfold him
[01:30:45.650 --> 01:30:47.410]  and he's laying there and he's like,
[01:30:47.410 --> 01:30:49.450]  and I'm like, he's good.
[01:30:49.450 --> 01:30:51.410]  You know, I'm like, motherfucker.
[01:30:51.410 --> 01:30:53.490]  I'm like, why didn't you answer me?
[01:30:53.530 --> 01:30:55.570]  And he's like, oh, I'm so mad, you know.
[01:30:55.570 --> 01:30:57.210]  I was so happy he was alive.
[01:30:57.210 --> 01:30:58.850]  So I drug his ass back in the truck
[01:30:58.850 --> 01:31:00.130]  because a lot of times you get hit
[01:31:00.130 --> 01:31:00.970]  and you start getting shot at.
[01:31:00.970 --> 01:31:03.770]  It's like the initiation of like an ambush type shit
[01:31:03.770 --> 01:31:06.170]  or like a lot of times they set two charges.
[01:31:06.170 --> 01:31:07.170]  So they blow us up.
[01:31:07.170 --> 01:31:08.490]  And then when the people come to help you
[01:31:08.490 --> 01:31:11.410]  and they're in the hole, they blow it up again.
[01:31:11.410 --> 01:31:13.090]  So I drug his ass back in,
[01:31:13.090 --> 01:31:13.930]  in case they were getting shot at.
[01:31:13.930 --> 01:31:15.530]  I don't know what's going on.
[01:31:15.530 --> 01:31:17.330]  And a couple minutes later,
[01:31:17.330 --> 01:31:18.730]  the dudes behind us in the truck,
[01:31:18.730 --> 01:31:21.250]  they broke protocol and they drove right up to the hole.
[01:31:21.290 --> 01:31:24.850]  The bomb left a 20 foot wide hole by 10 feet deep,
[01:31:25.810 --> 01:31:27.730]  250 pounds of explosives.
[01:31:28.810 --> 01:31:30.650]  And those dudes drove right up to it
[01:31:30.650 --> 01:31:31.890]  and they're fucking LVSR,
[01:31:31.890 --> 01:31:34.490]  which is like a semi truck, you know.
[01:31:34.490 --> 01:31:36.330]  Wah, pull up, baby bear comes out.
[01:31:36.330 --> 01:31:39.210]  He fucking opens, I remember he opens up the turret.
[01:31:39.210 --> 01:31:40.050]  And I was suited, man.
[01:31:40.050 --> 01:31:42.210]  And I was like, look at him.
[01:31:42.210 --> 01:31:44.210]  He's like, you guys good?
[01:31:44.210 --> 01:31:46.290]  And I look back, I'm like, yeah, we're good.
[01:31:46.290 --> 01:31:47.850]  I'm like seated and screaming at him and shit.
[01:31:47.850 --> 01:31:48.810]  He's like laughing, you know,
[01:31:48.810 --> 01:31:51.170]  it's like his third deployment.
[01:31:52.050 --> 01:31:52.890]  He's like, all right, man, calm down.
[01:31:52.890 --> 01:31:55.130]  And I'm like, no, no, I'm like fucking you.
[01:31:55.130 --> 01:31:56.890]  And so I helped carry my two buddies
[01:31:56.890 --> 01:31:58.570]  that were pretty fucked up to the truck.
[01:31:58.570 --> 01:32:01.290]  They got a bird called in, flew them out.
[01:32:01.290 --> 01:32:02.690]  And then the rest of the time,
[01:32:02.690 --> 01:32:05.770]  the truck is like next to the fucking hole,
[01:32:05.770 --> 01:32:07.410]  but I'm taking the equipment out,
[01:32:07.410 --> 01:32:09.770]  like the serialized gear, like the weapons and the radio
[01:32:09.770 --> 01:32:11.450]  and shit like that.
[01:32:11.450 --> 01:32:12.290]  And they're telling me like,
[01:32:12.290 --> 01:32:13.690]  they're like, hey, go get checked out by doc.
[01:32:13.690 --> 01:32:14.690]  I'm like, no, I'm fucking,
[01:32:14.690 --> 01:32:16.650]  I'm taking the shit out of this truck, like fuck you.
[01:32:16.650 --> 01:32:18.410]  I'm like throwing the finger out back,
[01:32:18.410 --> 01:32:20.090]  whoever threw me out the shit.
[01:32:21.090 --> 01:32:23.050]  And I'm just like in it and I'm walking.
[01:32:23.050 --> 01:32:25.290]  I don't realize I'm walking back through that hole,
[01:32:25.290 --> 01:32:26.450]  which is a huge no, no,
[01:32:26.450 --> 01:32:29.410]  like with the gear to put it in a different truck.
[01:32:29.410 --> 01:32:31.450]  And I come through once and the gunny,
[01:32:31.450 --> 01:32:34.610]  he's like, hi, there's a security team here on the convoy.
[01:32:35.730 --> 01:32:37.450]  He's like, Tarbon, go get checked out by the doc.
[01:32:37.450 --> 01:32:39.090]  I'm like, no, I'm not going to let him.
[01:32:39.090 --> 01:32:40.730]  Fucking go back to the truck,
[01:32:40.730 --> 01:32:42.490]  get more gear, come through the hole again.
[01:32:42.490 --> 01:32:44.850]  He's like, Tarbon, he fucking screams at me
[01:32:44.850 --> 01:32:46.610]  and I kind of like snap me out of it.
[01:32:46.610 --> 01:32:47.850]  I like look around,
[01:32:47.850 --> 01:32:49.890]  standing right in the middle of the fucking hole.
[01:32:50.690 --> 01:32:53.290]  He's like, get the fuck out of there, go see the doc.
[01:32:53.290 --> 01:32:56.570]  So go see the doc, you get that MACE exam,
[01:32:56.570 --> 01:32:59.130]  which is like a head injury shit or whatever.
[01:33:00.170 --> 01:33:02.250]  Be like 30 is a perfect score.
[01:33:02.250 --> 01:33:03.570]  I just ask you stuff like,
[01:33:03.570 --> 01:33:05.250]  they'll say, remember these words,
[01:33:05.250 --> 01:33:08.450]  like spoon, bong, lighter, you know?
[01:33:08.450 --> 01:33:11.490]  And then at the end, you know, that type of shit.
[01:33:11.490 --> 01:33:15.890]  So we all like failed it at varying degrees.
[01:33:15.890 --> 01:33:19.650]  And I threw my two buddies out.
[01:33:20.410 --> 01:33:21.250]  They covered our truck.
[01:33:21.250 --> 01:33:22.090]  We got to where we were going.
[01:33:22.090 --> 01:33:24.010]  We were only like a couple of clicks away.
[01:33:24.010 --> 01:33:25.410]  We get to where we were going and they're like,
[01:33:25.410 --> 01:33:28.690]  hey, Tarbon, Philips, the docs here
[01:33:28.690 --> 01:33:29.610]  want to check you out too.
[01:33:29.610 --> 01:33:31.050]  And we're like, whatever.
[01:33:31.050 --> 01:33:33.170]  So we go see the docs on the FOB
[01:33:33.170 --> 01:33:34.890]  and there's one like newer guy,
[01:33:34.890 --> 01:33:36.210]  you can tell he's newer.
[01:33:36.210 --> 01:33:37.970]  And there's like a senior dude,
[01:33:37.970 --> 01:33:40.290]  like a poor man, like a nurse, you know?
[01:33:40.290 --> 01:33:41.610]  And the senior dude's telling the other guy
[01:33:41.610 --> 01:33:42.690]  to like check me out.
[01:33:42.690 --> 01:33:45.010]  So he's like, takes the light, shines it in my eyes.
[01:33:45.010 --> 01:33:47.810]  He looks and he like looks back at the other guy.
[01:33:47.850 --> 01:33:49.890]  He does it again.
[01:33:49.890 --> 01:33:50.730]  He looks back at the other guy.
[01:33:50.730 --> 01:33:51.930]  I'm like, what?
[01:33:51.930 --> 01:33:53.250]  And the other doc comes over.
[01:33:53.250 --> 01:33:54.330]  He's like, yeah, what's up?
[01:33:54.330 --> 01:33:55.450]  Shines the light in my eyes.
[01:33:55.450 --> 01:33:58.610]  And the senior doc goes, oh shit, start a nine line.
[01:33:58.610 --> 01:34:00.410]  And a nine line is to get the bird to fly
[01:34:00.410 --> 01:34:02.170]  and pick you up and you gotta back you out.
[01:34:02.170 --> 01:34:03.370]  And I'm like, I'm fine.
[01:34:03.370 --> 01:34:05.490]  Like, I just got a headache.
[01:34:05.490 --> 01:34:07.890]  They're like, no dude, like one of your pupils
[01:34:07.890 --> 01:34:09.490]  is like pinpoint and the other one
[01:34:09.490 --> 01:34:11.810]  is like a fucking thing.
[01:34:11.810 --> 01:34:13.610]  And I was like, so?
[01:34:13.610 --> 01:34:14.450]  I was like, so?
[01:34:14.450 --> 01:34:17.370]  And they're like, that's the class of sign of like TBI,
[01:34:17.930 --> 01:34:20.090]  like a bad energy.
[01:34:20.090 --> 01:34:21.450]  So I'm like, oh shit.
[01:34:21.450 --> 01:34:23.610]  So they flew me out on the Black Hawk.
[01:34:26.050 --> 01:34:27.970]  And that was sweet.
[01:34:27.970 --> 01:34:29.570]  That was the first time I ever got to fly on a hero,
[01:34:29.570 --> 01:34:34.010]  but there's like the pilot, the co-pilot, a gunner,
[01:34:34.010 --> 01:34:35.690]  the doc that was knelt down in front of us
[01:34:35.690 --> 01:34:36.650]  asking us questions.
[01:34:36.650 --> 01:34:39.850]  And then a female, who's like,
[01:34:39.850 --> 01:34:41.770]  they have all their, you know, their face shit on,
[01:34:41.770 --> 01:34:43.850]  like their helmet with their like mask,
[01:34:43.850 --> 01:34:45.250]  breathing mask or whatever.
[01:34:45.250 --> 01:34:46.450]  So the guy's knelt in front of me
[01:34:46.450 --> 01:34:48.730]  and he's asking me questions, you know?
[01:34:48.730 --> 01:34:49.570]  Like, oh, you feel it?
[01:34:49.570 --> 01:34:52.330]  I'm like, yeah, it's my head and my neck hurts a little bit.
[01:34:52.330 --> 01:34:53.370]  And he's like, oh, your neck?
[01:34:53.370 --> 01:34:54.690]  Oh, okay, lay down on the stretcher.
[01:34:54.690 --> 01:34:57.690]  Like you got a fucking, put the neck brace on.
[01:34:57.690 --> 01:34:59.890]  I was like, no dude, I was like, no.
[01:34:59.890 --> 01:35:01.450]  And he was like, yeah, man, like it's protocol.
[01:35:01.450 --> 01:35:03.450]  You said your neck hurts, you gotta lay in this.
[01:35:03.450 --> 01:35:04.930]  And I was like, no,
[01:35:04.930 --> 01:35:07.090]  like I'm walking into the fucking hospital.
[01:35:08.370 --> 01:35:12.130]  And at that moment, dude, the female,
[01:35:12.130 --> 01:35:14.650]  she un-pops her fucking face thing, flips it over,
[01:35:14.650 --> 01:35:16.170]  she's beautiful, flips it over
[01:35:16.890 --> 01:35:17.970]  and she's like, lay the fuck down.
[01:35:17.970 --> 01:35:19.250]  And I was like, all right.
[01:35:19.250 --> 01:35:23.170]  And I fucking laid down and get me to the hospital,
[01:35:23.170 --> 01:35:26.050]  pull me up and I'm closed, but I'm like locked
[01:35:26.050 --> 01:35:28.290]  into this thing and there's like British dudes
[01:35:28.290 --> 01:35:31.570]  and then Marines as well that are like receiving
[01:35:31.570 --> 01:35:32.410]  and it's insane.
[01:35:32.410 --> 01:35:35.850]  Like you're sitting outside on the stretcher
[01:35:35.850 --> 01:35:37.690]  and the British dude, he's like,
[01:35:37.690 --> 01:35:39.010]  he had cauliflower ear and shit.
[01:35:39.010 --> 01:35:40.850]  So I was like, you wrestling, you know?
[01:35:40.850 --> 01:35:41.690]  Play rugby.
[01:35:41.690 --> 01:35:42.690]  But he was like, bullshit.
[01:35:42.690 --> 01:35:44.130]  And he was like, hey, you want me to take your boots off,
[01:35:44.130 --> 01:35:44.970]  mate?
[01:35:44.970 --> 01:35:45.850]  Like, you're gonna cut them off.
[01:35:46.530 --> 01:35:47.770]  And I was like, yeah, take my boots off.
[01:35:47.770 --> 01:35:48.610]  What do you mean you're gonna cut them off?
[01:35:48.610 --> 01:35:50.850]  He's like, dude, you're gonna cut all your shit off.
[01:35:50.850 --> 01:35:51.810]  So I'm like, yeah, take my boots.
[01:35:51.810 --> 01:35:52.970]  They take my boots off.
[01:35:53.930 --> 01:35:55.890]  They wheel me in and it's a madhouse, dude.
[01:35:55.890 --> 01:35:57.810]  There's like five doctors, 10 nurses.
[01:35:57.810 --> 01:36:00.410]  They're fucking sticking you to fucking,
[01:36:00.410 --> 01:36:02.530]  all I feel is tugs and cuts.
[01:36:02.530 --> 01:36:04.250]  And next thing you know, I feel my underwear tug
[01:36:04.250 --> 01:36:07.090]  and I'm like, oh, snit all these hot nurses around
[01:36:07.090 --> 01:36:09.530]  and stuff, cut my underwear off.
[01:36:09.530 --> 01:36:10.370]  I'm just naked.
[01:36:10.370 --> 01:36:12.770]  They're checking everywhere, you know?
[01:36:12.770 --> 01:36:14.970]  They wheel you around to MRIs, all these brain scans,
[01:36:15.410 --> 01:36:17.490]  all this back, yada, yada, yada.
[01:36:17.490 --> 01:36:20.170]  And next thing you know, you're out of there.
[01:36:20.170 --> 01:36:21.010]  You're up in the hospital.
[01:36:21.010 --> 01:36:21.850]  I was with my buddies.
[01:36:21.850 --> 01:36:23.370]  They were sleeping.
[01:36:23.370 --> 01:36:28.370]  And yeah, like, that was it.
[01:36:32.450 --> 01:36:36.770]  Well, was there anything wrong with your neck?
[01:36:36.770 --> 01:36:40.850]  I mean, it seems like they were following protocol
[01:36:40.850 --> 01:36:43.610]  to make sure, what were they worried about?
[01:36:44.610 --> 01:36:47.890]  So I was an EMT, so I understand it now.
[01:36:47.890 --> 01:36:49.850]  Anytime someone like that, that's like,
[01:36:51.330 --> 01:36:52.770]  there could be other things going on
[01:36:52.770 --> 01:36:54.050]  and you don't realize,
[01:36:54.050 --> 01:36:55.770]  you don't wanna mess with a neck injury.
[01:36:55.770 --> 01:36:57.250]  So if there's like, you were just,
[01:36:57.250 --> 01:36:59.130]  you gotta look at the mechanism of injury.
[01:36:59.130 --> 01:37:02.690]  So it was a big blast, right?
[01:37:02.690 --> 01:37:05.130]  So we were thinking like more shit could be going on
[01:37:05.130 --> 01:37:06.450]  than just like a sore neck, you know?
[01:37:06.450 --> 01:37:08.130]  Like maybe you can treat something
[01:37:08.130 --> 01:37:09.450]  that you don't realize yet.
[01:37:09.450 --> 01:37:12.930]  Or like, my EMT instructor told me
[01:37:12.970 --> 01:37:14.810]  that they had a guy with a neck injury
[01:37:14.810 --> 01:37:16.410]  that they had to go five miles an hour
[01:37:16.410 --> 01:37:18.290]  to the fucking hospital too.
[01:37:18.290 --> 01:37:19.450]  And they were coming over the tracks,
[01:37:19.450 --> 01:37:21.650]  like huddling over the tracks so slow.
[01:37:21.650 --> 01:37:23.490]  And just from the truck rocking back and forth,
[01:37:23.490 --> 01:37:24.690]  like it killed the guy.
[01:37:24.690 --> 01:37:27.330]  Like fuck up whatever it was like,
[01:37:27.330 --> 01:37:30.170]  wrong in his neck to a point where it killed him.
[01:37:30.170 --> 01:37:32.290]  So like, they don't mess around with that.
[01:37:33.690 --> 01:37:35.450]  But man, like I've heard stories of dudes getting shot,
[01:37:35.450 --> 01:37:38.330]  like literally 10 times walking into the hospital and shit.
[01:37:38.330 --> 01:37:41.130]  So I just thought, you know, I was like,
[01:37:41.130 --> 01:37:42.130]  I don't wanna walk.
[01:37:43.570 --> 01:37:47.770]  So just quickly, because it's gonna scroll past me,
[01:37:47.770 --> 01:37:49.850]  but, whoop, not that one.
[01:37:53.250 --> 01:37:56.330]  Do you let the beds dry up a little bit before harvesting
[01:37:56.330 --> 01:37:59.250]  or do you keep the moisture levels dialed in?
[01:37:59.250 --> 01:38:01.010]  I keep it dialed in the whole time.
[01:38:01.010 --> 01:38:03.730]  Even like post-harvest now too.
[01:38:03.730 --> 01:38:05.690]  I leave the Blue Max and let them rock.
[01:38:09.560 --> 01:38:10.760]  Got it.
[01:38:10.760 --> 01:38:12.320]  And we'll end on this one.
[01:38:12.320 --> 01:38:13.720]  You ready for it?
[01:38:13.720 --> 01:38:14.560]  Yep.
[01:38:16.080 --> 01:38:16.920]  You're a bad ass.
[01:38:18.240 --> 01:38:19.480]  Nah, I'm just, nah.
[01:38:19.480 --> 01:38:21.960]  Just a dude that went through an experience, that's all.
[01:38:21.960 --> 01:38:23.600]  Everyone has their shit, you know.
[01:38:23.600 --> 01:38:26.760]  That's something, just real quick before we go.
[01:38:26.760 --> 01:38:29.600]  People will come up to me and they'll talk to me about like,
[01:38:29.600 --> 01:38:31.360]  like say they got in a car wreck or something.
[01:38:31.360 --> 01:38:33.000]  And they'll start saying like the crazy shit
[01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:34.760]  they went through and they'll stop me.
[01:38:34.760 --> 01:38:36.080]  Oh, I know it's nothing like you.
[01:38:36.080 --> 01:38:39.520]  And I hate, like don't minimize what's going on with you
[01:38:39.520 --> 01:38:40.920]  because you think someone,
[01:38:41.040 --> 01:38:44.680]  you think someone went through something.
[01:38:44.680 --> 01:38:46.400]  It's a reality, you know what I mean?
[01:38:46.400 --> 01:38:47.600]  Like it's your reality.
[01:38:47.600 --> 01:38:49.000]  If it's affecting you, it's affecting you.
[01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:50.840]  Something that you need to address
[01:38:50.840 --> 01:38:53.840]  and don't minimize that shit.
[01:38:53.840 --> 01:38:55.160]  Don't do it, you know.
[01:38:56.400 --> 01:38:57.840]  My aunt does that.
[01:38:57.840 --> 01:38:59.040]  She had a tree fall on her house
[01:38:59.040 --> 01:39:01.040]  and almost got like fucked up shit.
[01:39:01.040 --> 01:39:03.240]  And she does that to me all the time.
[01:39:03.240 --> 01:39:08.240]  All the time I tell her like, don't minimize that, you know.
[01:39:09.240 --> 01:39:12.880]  All right, well, I think that's a good spot to end it on.
[01:39:13.960 --> 01:39:16.560]  We appreciate the, there we go.
[01:39:16.560 --> 01:39:20.560]  We appreciate the garden tour.
[01:39:22.440 --> 01:39:24.280]  And thanks everyone for watching.
[01:39:24.280 --> 01:39:26.440]  I'm gonna start my work today.
[01:39:26.440 --> 01:39:27.280]  Bye bye.
[01:39:28.920 --> 01:39:30.760]  That was impromptu, I like this.
[01:39:30.760 --> 01:39:32.000]  I'm like, you wanna go live?
[01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:32.840]  And you were like, let's go.
[01:39:32.840 --> 01:39:35.520]  Actually I thought you were in the shower.
[01:39:35.640 --> 01:39:38.400]  You're like, can I call you back in like two minutes?
[01:39:38.400 --> 01:39:40.560]  Yeah, and I was talking to my buddies
[01:39:40.560 --> 01:39:42.440]  cause like I'm just anxious over it, you know.
[01:39:42.440 --> 01:39:44.880]  Like dude, do it, like fuck it, you know.
[01:39:44.880 --> 01:39:46.120]  So I'm glad I did.
[01:39:46.120 --> 01:39:46.960]  Thanks for having me, man.
[01:39:46.960 --> 01:39:47.800]  I appreciate it a lot.
[01:39:47.800 --> 01:39:49.480]  And I appreciate all the content you put out.
[01:39:49.480 --> 01:39:51.880]  And like, seriously, thank you so much.
[01:39:51.880 --> 01:39:56.880]  Yeah, so I'll get, I'll ping the guys at Evolution
[01:39:59.120 --> 01:40:02.760]  and then we'll bring you back on soon.
[01:40:02.800 --> 01:40:06.840]  Cause I wanna have some, like Tyler Blue Green Tank wants,
[01:40:06.840 --> 01:40:10.640]  he wants to have a conversation about kind of, you know,
[01:40:10.640 --> 01:40:12.160]  and this doesn't really apply to you,
[01:40:12.160 --> 01:40:14.720]  but you'd probably have fun in the conversation.
[01:40:15.960 --> 01:40:18.680]  What to do to keep your raised beds humming
[01:40:18.680 --> 01:40:20.080]  between seasons, right?
[01:40:20.080 --> 01:40:24.840]  So he's in Maine, you know, shutting things down,
[01:40:24.840 --> 01:40:26.680]  but what does he do?
[01:40:26.680 --> 01:40:28.720]  Cause I think he has some in a greenhouse,
[01:40:28.720 --> 01:40:32.080]  so he could keep stuff going.
[01:40:32.120 --> 01:40:34.120]  I don't know what is, anyway, we'll find out,
[01:40:34.120 --> 01:40:36.400]  but we're gonna have some raised bed,
[01:40:36.400 --> 01:40:38.240]  living soil round tables.
[01:40:38.240 --> 01:40:43.240]  So when you're in the shower neck, just keep it close.
[01:40:44.840 --> 01:40:46.760]  All right, man, sounds good.
[01:40:46.760 --> 01:40:48.280]  All right, everyone.
[01:40:48.280 --> 01:40:49.480]  Thank you.
[01:40:50.640 --> 01:40:51.760]  Thanks everyone.
[01:40:51.760 --> 01:40:52.600]  Thanks Peter.
[01:40:54.320 --> 01:40:56.480]  Yeah, I'll just post some of these up.
[01:40:57.800 --> 01:40:59.480]  All right, that was fun.
[01:40:59.480 --> 01:41:01.520]  So thanks for all tuning in.
[01:41:03.080 --> 01:41:08.080]  Yeah, so all I'm trying to think, what's today?
[01:41:10.200 --> 01:41:12.400]  Wednesday, so tomorrow we have,
[01:41:13.560 --> 01:41:17.200]  actually I can tell you, cause he just posted it.
[01:41:19.160 --> 01:41:21.560]  So tomorrow we have Leighton and Brian,
[01:41:21.560 --> 01:41:24.760]  I know, sorry, we're doing a dab night on Saturday night,
[01:41:24.760 --> 01:41:28.040]  but tomorrow, which is Thursday,
[01:41:28.040 --> 01:41:30.080]  oh, Green Bodie, fuck yeah.
[01:41:31.080 --> 01:41:36.080]  And then James Loud on Sunday is with,
[01:41:42.080 --> 01:41:43.280]  give me a second.
[01:41:46.380 --> 01:41:47.900]  Where are you James?
[01:41:50.990 --> 01:41:52.950]  With Cannabis Brothers.
[01:41:53.990 --> 01:41:56.230]  And I know I had something else.
[01:41:56.230 --> 01:42:01.230]  I might do something with Green Bodies tomorrow.
[01:42:03.910 --> 01:42:07.030]  Actually, let me, I gotta post that on Instagram.
[01:42:07.030 --> 01:42:10.950]  But, and then Sunday, I'm trying to schedule something
[01:42:10.950 --> 01:42:15.830]  with the author of Tystick, Peter McGuire,
[01:42:15.830 --> 01:42:18.630]  and then Mike Ritter, who's the guy who is running drugs
[01:42:19.630 --> 01:42:24.310]  from Southeast Asia into the US and like the 70s and 80s.
[01:42:24.310 --> 01:42:27.870]  And Fred Christman, who is, I think like a cannabis
[01:42:27.870 --> 01:42:29.670]  historian and economist.
[01:42:29.750 --> 01:42:32.270]  But anyway, I gotta get to work.
[01:42:32.270 --> 01:42:35.790]  So with that, peace out everyone,
[01:42:36.870 --> 01:42:41.870]  and go smoke some weed and have a good, productive Wednesday
[01:42:43.630 --> 01:42:46.470]  or whatever day it is, wherever you are in the world.
[01:42:46.470 --> 01:42:48.910]  And with that, I'm gonna kill the live stream
[01:42:48.910 --> 01:42:51.030]  and we'll see you again soon.
[01:42:51.030 --> 01:42:52.910]  And if you have ideas of people who wanna share,
[01:42:52.910 --> 01:42:56.470]  if you wanna share, I know some people have sent me videos
[01:42:57.470 --> 01:43:00.990]  and I just gotta get to them and edit them.
[01:43:00.990 --> 01:43:03.190]  Sometimes I forget about videos
[01:43:03.190 --> 01:43:05.110]  that I've had lying around for months.
[01:43:07.870 --> 01:43:09.870]  Yeah, Riley Quinn hit me up.
[01:43:11.150 --> 01:43:15.830]  Cause I wanted to get someone who, you know,
[01:43:15.830 --> 01:43:20.430]  like I know one of the entry points was like a cove
[01:43:20.430 --> 01:43:25.430]  in Mendocino and, you know, to find someone who like
[01:43:25.710 --> 01:43:32.750]  was around back then that, you know,
[01:43:33.110 --> 01:43:35.310]  I want someone to be like, I was there like,
[01:43:36.950 --> 01:43:40.430]  and I assume there were entry points up and down the coast,
[01:43:40.430 --> 01:43:44.430]  you know, from San Diego up to Washington state,
[01:43:44.430 --> 01:43:46.710]  you know, coming from, you know, across the Pacific
[01:43:46.710 --> 01:43:49.390]  and where can we sneak this shit in?
[01:43:51.230 --> 01:43:55.430]  But anyway, and then I'm trying to schedule something
[01:43:55.430 --> 01:43:59.550]  with Michael Box from Blue Mat to walk me through
[01:43:59.550 --> 01:44:01.870]  the moisture meter and then setting up.
[01:44:04.270 --> 01:44:08.310]  I have a bunch of drippers and irrigation stuff.
[01:44:13.660 --> 01:44:17.740]  Amanda dope, Ezekiel, who are you talking about?
[01:44:17.740 --> 01:44:19.580]  Mendo dope.
[01:44:19.580 --> 01:44:20.420]  Well, hold on.
[01:44:22.020 --> 01:44:23.340]  Who are you talking about?
[01:44:31.440 --> 01:44:34.040]  Okay, I don't quite understand the comment, but.
[01:44:35.880 --> 01:44:39.160]  So Riley Quinn, Peter,
[01:44:42.160 --> 01:44:43.800]  future, I wish I had this on.
[01:44:45.680 --> 01:44:46.920]  Riley, where are you?
[01:44:48.080 --> 01:44:49.160]  Or where are these guys?
[01:44:49.160 --> 01:44:53.440]  Were they, what, what entry point were they?
[01:44:57.740 --> 01:44:59.300]  Oh, Indonesia?
[01:44:59.300 --> 01:45:00.460]  Or what are you saying?
[01:45:04.800 --> 01:45:06.360]  Oh, you're in Australia, okay.
[01:45:11.480 --> 01:45:12.320]  Okay.
[01:45:17.310 --> 01:45:20.150]  Under the canopy, logged in.
[01:45:20.150 --> 01:45:21.670]  What's up?
[01:45:21.670 --> 01:45:22.790]  No, that was awesome.
[01:45:24.550 --> 01:45:27.310]  And it's interesting, cause I, you know, I'm learning,
[01:45:27.310 --> 01:45:29.390]  like, I didn't know you were blown up
[01:45:30.790 --> 01:45:32.430]  until we started talking about it.
[01:45:32.430 --> 01:45:33.670]  I didn't even know you were in the military
[01:45:33.670 --> 01:45:35.350]  until we started talking about it.
[01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:43.320]  Ah, okay, bring on the Mendo dope boys.
[01:45:43.320 --> 01:45:44.400]  Got it, got it, got it.
[01:45:44.400 --> 01:45:45.240]  All right.
[01:45:49.960 --> 01:45:50.800]  Yeah.
[01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:55.240]  We will make that happen.
[01:45:55.240 --> 01:46:00.240]  I also have a Glenn, big baby Davis on the back burner
[01:46:00.920 --> 01:46:05.120]  until the Celtics T-shirt that I made
[01:46:06.240 --> 01:46:08.280]  arrives from the printer.
[01:46:08.280 --> 01:46:09.680]  But I didn't want to do it until then.
[01:46:09.680 --> 01:46:11.000]  And it's taken for fucking,
[01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:14.000]  I think I designed it five weeks ago
[01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:15.160]  and it still hasn't shown up.
[01:46:15.160 --> 01:46:20.160]  So we'll talk Celtics, Rajon Rondo, weed.
[01:46:23.040 --> 01:46:24.560]  Anyway, with that,
[01:46:26.120 --> 01:46:29.520]  hope everyone enjoyed the impromptu conversation,
[01:46:29.520 --> 01:46:30.920]  little morning garden tour,
[01:46:30.920 --> 01:46:33.920]  and maybe we'll squish tonight.
[01:46:34.960 --> 01:46:39.480]  Yeah, well, with Kevin, he's wrapping up harvest.
[01:46:39.480 --> 01:46:43.720]  So I wanted to be respectful of that.
[01:46:43.720 --> 01:46:45.760]  Steve's still floating around his pool,
[01:46:45.760 --> 01:46:47.320]  although he closed the pool up.
[01:46:49.080 --> 01:46:51.040]  Yeah, we can get them back on together.
[01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:54.360]  And then I wanted,
[01:46:54.360 --> 01:46:56.840]  I'm gonna bring some glass blowers on.
[01:46:59.280 --> 01:47:00.560]  Anyone has ideas?
[01:47:01.800 --> 01:47:05.280]  I have no pride of coming up with ideas, topics, people.
[01:47:05.280 --> 01:47:09.560]  So if someone else wants to recommend ideas
[01:47:09.560 --> 01:47:13.520]  or put together a conversation, let me know.
[01:47:15.080 --> 01:47:16.320]  Is that Arabic?
[01:47:16.320 --> 01:47:17.160]  I don't know.
[01:47:19.040 --> 01:47:21.720]  You speaking Arabic, I don't understand.
[01:47:23.560 --> 01:47:26.000]  Or what, can you write whatever that is?
[01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:28.800]  Or yeah, I have no idea what that is.
[01:47:30.040 --> 01:47:32.520]  I'm guessing Arabic, but I could be totally off.
[01:47:37.570 --> 01:47:41.010]  Dan, if you know any of them, send them my way.
[01:47:44.240 --> 01:47:45.760]  Well, Curtis, I kind of feel like
[01:47:45.760 --> 01:47:47.720]  that's what we were just doing a little bit.
[01:47:47.720 --> 01:47:51.480]  He was talking about what he's doing and why he's doing it.
[01:47:51.480 --> 01:47:54.480]  But yes, that's, and that's what I try to do with Tom.
[01:47:55.080 --> 01:47:56.840]  But yes, you are hurt.
[01:47:56.840 --> 01:47:58.880]  Dave Watson, I've been talking to,
[01:47:58.880 --> 01:48:00.600]  he wants to do something.
[01:48:03.200 --> 01:48:06.800]  He wanted to wait till he got back to the UK, I think,
[01:48:09.160 --> 01:48:11.320]  which is probably right about now.
[01:48:11.320 --> 01:48:13.400]  So we'll get that one done.
[01:48:13.400 --> 01:48:18.400]  He wants to talk skunk and Scooby tuning in from the UK.
[01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:26.240]  Scott, is that a gorilla?
[01:48:31.750 --> 01:48:33.910]  Oh, stop it, the Wayfarer.
[01:48:33.910 --> 01:48:36.350]  I brought conservatives too.
[01:48:36.350 --> 01:48:37.550]  Don't get butt hurt.
[01:48:39.630 --> 01:48:42.870]  Said stop bringing those libtard politics into the plant.
[01:48:44.550 --> 01:48:46.990]  I bring people from all sides.
[01:48:52.360 --> 01:48:53.840]  Yeah, don't give your address.
[01:48:53.840 --> 01:48:56.000]  Okay, all right, well, we'll wrap it on that.
[01:48:56.000 --> 01:48:57.160]  Thanks, everyone.
[01:48:58.280 --> 01:48:59.520]  I appreciate it.
[01:49:01.360 --> 01:49:02.840]  I'm already tired and it's only,
[01:49:02.840 --> 01:49:04.440]  it's not even 11 in the morning.
[01:49:05.640 --> 01:49:07.080]  All right, so I'm gonna kill the stream
[01:49:07.080 --> 01:49:09.320]  and I may be back in five minutes.
[01:49:09.320 --> 01:49:11.120]  I may be back tomorrow.
[01:49:11.120 --> 01:49:11.960]  See ya.
[01:49:12.880 --> 01:49:14.080]  I know plants, all right.
[01:49:14.080 --> 01:49:17.280]  So with the politics, I feel like policy,
[01:49:18.280 --> 01:49:19.960]  this thing was once illegal
[01:49:19.960 --> 01:49:21.640]  and people were thrown in jail for it.
[01:49:21.640 --> 01:49:25.240]  So that's everything from advocacy to policy
[01:49:25.240 --> 01:49:26.760]  to a lot of other stuff.
[01:49:26.800 --> 01:49:31.440]  And it's like, if you don't wanna watch that one,
[01:49:31.440 --> 01:49:32.640]  just don't watch it.
[01:49:32.640 --> 01:49:35.120]  I always think of it as like, when you,
[01:49:36.960 --> 01:49:41.760]  ESPN has like girls college softball playing sometimes
[01:49:41.760 --> 01:49:44.280]  and I just don't watch it then.
[01:49:44.280 --> 01:49:48.240]  But when like the NBA finals are on, I'm right back there.
[01:49:48.240 --> 01:49:51.080]  So when it's your equivalent
[01:49:51.080 --> 01:49:52.480]  of something you don't wanna watch,
[01:49:52.480 --> 01:49:54.600]  just tune out and come back later
[01:49:54.600 --> 01:49:56.440]  and something you like will be on.
[01:49:57.280 --> 01:50:01.080]  But anyway, I'm all over the place,
[01:50:01.080 --> 01:50:02.880]  but there's policy stuff.
[01:50:02.880 --> 01:50:06.360]  I wanna do something for Christian
[01:50:06.360 --> 01:50:10.800]  who's in jail in El Dorado.
[01:50:10.800 --> 01:50:12.440]  So that's advocacy.
[01:50:12.440 --> 01:50:17.160]  And then Eddie Lep, I was communicating with his,
[01:50:17.160 --> 01:50:18.200]  I guess, girlfriend.
[01:50:18.200 --> 01:50:19.400]  I don't know if she's his wife,
[01:50:19.400 --> 01:50:22.760]  but about trying to raise some money for him.
[01:50:22.760 --> 01:50:25.080]  If any of you have seen,
[01:50:25.080 --> 01:50:27.240]  he has cancer and no money.
[01:50:27.240 --> 01:50:32.240]  And the hospital is like 90 minutes away
[01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:34.920]  for two hours away from where he lives.
[01:50:34.920 --> 01:50:37.040]  So he has to do that round trip every day.
[01:50:39.200 --> 01:50:44.200]  Yeah, the, but Johnny is a huge college softball enthusiast.
[01:50:49.240 --> 01:50:52.320]  Live to survive channel, the dude is not water.
[01:50:53.320 --> 01:50:55.760]  Yeah, so he's dry farming.
[01:50:55.760 --> 01:50:57.240]  He has a water table.
[01:50:59.360 --> 01:51:01.320]  Sorry, I'm reading that one.
[01:51:05.530 --> 01:51:09.450]  Yeah, and for me, getting a politician on,
[01:51:09.450 --> 01:51:11.650]  and again, if it's someone from the left or right,
[01:51:11.650 --> 01:51:14.250]  and I have, I just want them to state
[01:51:14.250 --> 01:51:17.050]  what their platform is related to cannabis.
[01:51:18.210 --> 01:51:19.690]  And obviously everyone can say,
[01:51:19.690 --> 01:51:21.610]  well, they're a politician,
[01:51:21.610 --> 01:51:23.610]  they'll say anything to get votes.
[01:51:24.090 --> 01:51:27.250]  Right, but we got to start somewhere.
[01:51:27.250 --> 01:51:30.010]  And I feel like if it's out there publicly
[01:51:30.010 --> 01:51:31.970]  that they stated something like,
[01:51:33.690 --> 01:51:35.850]  you can try to hold them accountable to it.
[01:51:39.810 --> 01:51:40.650]  Right.
[01:51:44.290 --> 01:51:49.290]  Yes, we will go back to Steve's facility in Nevada
[01:51:49.290 --> 01:51:51.250]  for round two.
[01:51:51.250 --> 01:51:52.770]  Chris Trump's down to come on.
[01:51:52.770 --> 01:51:55.610]  Again, all this shit, there's only one of me.
[01:51:55.610 --> 01:51:58.650]  So, and I got to schedule it.
[01:51:58.650 --> 01:52:01.090]  That's why I bring other people on to,
[01:52:01.090 --> 01:52:05.410]  like James has his weekly show, focused on breeding.
[01:52:08.650 --> 01:52:10.210]  Dermot and Riff, true in a way,
[01:52:10.210 --> 01:52:14.210]  but also like I know plenty of people who ran for local,
[01:52:15.530 --> 01:52:19.810]  like Cody Bass ran for, in California,
[01:52:19.810 --> 01:52:22.170]  he had a dispensary in Lake Tahoe
[01:52:22.170 --> 01:52:27.170]  and was just getting shat on by the town council
[01:52:27.170 --> 01:52:29.290]  and was finally like, fuck it,
[01:52:29.290 --> 01:52:33.010]  I'm gonna run for town council and ran and got a seat.
[01:52:33.010 --> 01:52:35.330]  And now he can affect local policy.
[01:52:37.450 --> 01:52:42.450]  So, there's people running for office at all levels
[01:52:43.010 --> 01:52:45.250]  and some of it's a little more local.
[01:52:45.250 --> 01:52:50.250]  And I'd like to see some of you run for office.
[01:52:51.130 --> 01:52:52.850]  Actually, that was kind of one of my things
[01:52:52.850 --> 01:52:54.610]  is hopefully some of you guys run
[01:52:54.610 --> 01:52:58.450]  and it's like a weed smoker gets into the hen house.
[01:53:00.970 --> 01:53:05.650]  So anyway, we will end on a nice comment towards me.
[01:53:06.530 --> 01:53:07.490]  I'm good enough.
[01:53:08.450 --> 01:53:11.170]  I'm smart enough and doggone it, people like me.
[01:53:12.490 --> 01:53:16.970]  So anyway, everyone have a good day.
[01:53:17.010 --> 01:53:20.290]  I'm playing around with StreamYard right now.
[01:53:21.250 --> 01:53:23.250]  I still have some technical difficulties.
[01:53:23.250 --> 01:53:27.010]  I can't connect my other or my main,
[01:53:27.010 --> 01:53:28.170]  basically my video switcher
[01:53:28.170 --> 01:53:30.130]  will not connect to it right now.
[01:53:30.130 --> 01:53:33.210]  But once I can do that, I will be unstoppable
[01:53:33.210 --> 01:53:35.090]  because it's so much more satisfying
[01:53:35.090 --> 01:53:40.090]  to be able to just post your comments like that
[01:53:41.090 --> 01:53:45.090]  than having to like read them or like keep track of them
[01:53:45.090 --> 01:53:48.770]  because the people typically who are in the conversation
[01:53:48.770 --> 01:53:50.690]  don't see the chat.
[01:53:50.690 --> 01:53:53.090]  So you wanna see Mike?
[01:53:53.090 --> 01:53:56.170]  Yeah, write in Mike Tyson for,
[01:53:58.050 --> 01:53:59.930]  he, well, I don't know if he lives out
[01:53:59.930 --> 01:54:04.930]  wherever his facility is, but yeah, Rex.
[01:54:04.970 --> 01:54:06.170]  That is true.
[01:54:06.170 --> 01:54:07.730]  There are douches.
[01:54:09.250 --> 01:54:12.970]  So yes, there's no, yeah.
[01:54:14.970 --> 01:54:17.090]  I forget, is Rex the father or the son?
[01:54:18.250 --> 01:54:20.290]  All right, I keep getting,
[01:54:20.290 --> 01:54:22.810]  I'm hearing the Mendo Dope boys,
[01:54:23.970 --> 01:54:26.290]  but was Rex the son or the father?
[01:54:27.850 --> 01:54:30.850]  Okay, so I'm gonna go with Rex.
[01:54:30.850 --> 01:54:32.170]  I'm gonna go with Rex.
[01:54:32.210 --> 01:54:33.050]  Father.
[01:54:37.480 --> 01:54:40.200]  Okay, so the father smokes weed?
[01:54:42.400 --> 01:54:46.400]  I know the son does, but anyway, yeah.
[01:54:46.400 --> 01:54:50.600]  Like in everything, you can have corruption and nepotism,
[01:54:51.720 --> 01:54:55.360]  even in weed, shocking, shocking.
[01:54:57.120 --> 01:54:58.960]  Yeah, don't like the windows.
[01:55:00.440 --> 01:55:01.280]  Yeah, loan what?
[01:55:01.280 --> 01:55:03.080]  No, I do, I'm loving it.
[01:55:03.080 --> 01:55:04.440]  This is like heaven,
[01:55:04.440 --> 01:55:07.920]  because I can make it much more communal.
[01:55:13.480 --> 01:55:16.840]  Yeah, so I think everybody wants,
[01:55:17.680 --> 01:55:20.800]  yeah, Todd was super busy,
[01:55:24.320 --> 01:55:25.760]  but he'll come on.
[01:55:25.760 --> 01:55:29.040]  I was actually gonna have him talk to Dave Watson
[01:55:31.840 --> 01:55:33.640]  and Greg McAllister, if you're watching.
[01:55:33.640 --> 01:55:35.120]  I wanted you to come on too,
[01:55:35.120 --> 01:55:38.760]  but you've hung up the cleats
[01:55:38.760 --> 01:55:41.640]  and wanna just stay retired
[01:55:41.640 --> 01:55:46.080]  and growing your fruits and vegetables in Hawaii
[01:55:46.080 --> 01:55:48.560]  to talk Northern Lights.
[01:55:53.480 --> 01:55:55.360]  Johnny, no Mike Tyson, thanks.
[01:55:56.280 --> 01:55:59.160]  Yeah, so this was kind of where I was going with it,
[01:55:59.160 --> 01:56:04.160]  is like, even if you don't believe politicians,
[01:56:04.280 --> 01:56:09.280]  if they had to kiss the ring of the cannabis constituency,
[01:56:10.040 --> 01:56:11.400]  that would be kind of cool.
[01:56:13.640 --> 01:56:20.300]  So that's true.
[01:56:24.240 --> 01:56:28.240]  And Kamala, whoop, sorry, I just skipped.
[01:56:28.240 --> 01:56:30.520]  Oh, fuck, where is it?
[01:56:30.520 --> 01:56:31.360]  Yeah.
[01:56:33.600 --> 01:56:37.240]  Yeah, no, Kamala, she was prosecuting people.
[01:56:37.240 --> 01:56:45.360]  And yeah, we got some.
[01:56:50.500 --> 01:56:53.740]  Ezekiel, right now I am,
[01:56:56.100 --> 01:57:00.220]  I have some stuff from some friends up in Humboldt.
[01:57:02.780 --> 01:57:05.380]  Family Tree Seeds just stocked me up on everything
[01:57:05.380 --> 01:57:07.020]  he grew this season.
[01:57:07.020 --> 01:57:09.780]  Sorry, I'm just also reading the,
[01:57:09.780 --> 01:57:12.180]  yeah, Kiss the Green Ring, that's right.
[01:57:14.380 --> 01:57:17.820]  So anyway, all right, everyone have a good day.
[01:57:17.820 --> 01:57:20.820]  I'm gonna go make my iced coffee
[01:57:20.820 --> 01:57:25.820]  and go out to the garden and tend to the plants.
[01:57:25.820 --> 01:57:28.820]  So with that, I will finally go to the livestream
[01:57:30.860 --> 01:57:33.180]  and have a good one.
[01:57:33.180 --> 01:57:36.220]  And have a good one.
