[00:00.000 --> 00:31.910]  I was stoked to get this grow underway. This is one week before the flip. It was
[00:31.910 --> 00:35.370]  sitting in one gallon containers, got a little root bound, a little over watered.
[00:35.370 --> 00:40.090]  As soon as I put them into the seven gallons of Sohum Living Soil, you guys
[00:40.090 --> 00:44.010]  are gonna see improvements week over week in the color and the growth. So
[00:44.010 --> 00:48.050]  again, here we are. This is week one of flower. I actually waited for it to get a
[00:48.050 --> 00:52.010]  little bit more vigor before I flipped it. This is how it's looking. The color is
[00:52.010 --> 00:56.930]  improving and that Sohum Living Soil is doing its job. That's a water-only soil
[00:56.930 --> 01:01.850]  by the way guys. I did not add a single nutrient for this entire grow. I just
[01:01.850 --> 01:06.410]  gave this water. Again, seven gallon container. It's sitting under the Spider
[01:06.410 --> 01:12.690]  Farmer SE 5000 light. That's a 480 watt light. For the most part, I keep it about
[01:13.010 --> 01:18.570]  12 to 18 inches off of the canopy. You can see here week two of flower, we've
[01:18.570 --> 01:23.090]  already got bud formation here. Lots of pistils. I do see a little bit of tip
[01:23.090 --> 01:27.690]  burn from the soil but that's fine. I mean look at the health. Look at the
[01:27.690 --> 01:33.330]  vigor of this plant compared to just even two weeks ago. Week three, I went
[01:33.330 --> 01:37.330]  in and I did a little bit of defoliation on everything. I wanted to make sure
[01:37.530 --> 01:43.170]  light can penetrate down. I wanted it to get through the canopy. As you can see a
[01:43.170 --> 01:47.810]  lot of bud sites there. I cleaned up the bottom a little bit. In the middle there
[01:47.810 --> 01:51.890]  you can see I topped it early on. These are just all the lower side shoots that
[01:51.890 --> 01:57.770]  have grown up and have become relatively equal height which makes our jobs a
[01:57.770 --> 02:03.810]  little bit easier trying to keep the light directly on the canopy. Week four,
[02:03.890 --> 02:08.610]  everything is starting to stack up again. That tight nodal spacing is
[02:08.610 --> 02:14.770]  leading to larger colas because as these buds grow bigger and swell, they connect.
[02:14.770 --> 02:21.490]  That's how we get nice fat colas. With week four of flower here, I am
[02:21.490 --> 02:25.410]  happy with the direction that it was taking. I had to add some twist ties
[02:25.410 --> 02:29.770]  there to support these things. As you can see here by week five, that little
[02:29.770 --> 02:34.410]  Yoda bud at top is taking shape. There's still some light you can see
[02:34.410 --> 02:38.930]  through these colas but this is the beginning of week five. You know those
[02:38.930 --> 02:44.690]  things are gonna plump up and fill out, swell together and turn into some solid
[02:44.690 --> 02:48.450]  colas. That one in the back I got my eyeball on. That's gonna be the biggest
[02:48.450 --> 02:53.130]  one. I could already tell by this point it's gonna be the heaviest yielder
[02:53.130 --> 02:58.170]  in the tent. Speaking of heavy, these things were getting heavy. By week
[02:58.210 --> 03:02.370]  six I had to add a little bit of that trellis net there. One thing I really
[03:02.370 --> 03:07.330]  loved about this plant is all of these side buds are chunky. They're not small
[03:07.330 --> 03:13.010]  little popcorn things. They're dense chunky buds. That's something that I like
[03:13.010 --> 03:16.450]  to see. You know more bang for your buck when you're growing out a plant.
[03:16.450 --> 03:22.850]  Also this new light that I'm using is penetrating very well. There you have it
[03:22.850 --> 03:26.050]  right there. Week seven, we've already got you know
[03:26.130 --> 03:31.810]  obviously some good trichome coverage. We've got everything starting to really
[03:31.810 --> 03:39.770]  swell up, go through its final push as far as its lifespan. Week eight, harvest
[03:39.770 --> 03:43.610]  week. Here we are. This is the beginning of the week. I harvested towards the end
[03:43.610 --> 03:49.570]  of the week. It was ready at about 56 days. I let it go to about 60 days just
[03:49.570 --> 03:53.370]  based on everything else I had. Got a little bit of fade here in that Sohum
[03:53.370 --> 03:58.810]  Living Soil. Again water only. I didn't add a single nutrient this entire run to
[03:58.810 --> 04:04.530]  the soil. All grown in the Sohum Living Soil under that Spider Farmer SE5000
[04:04.530 --> 04:09.890]  light. And boo yeah here you go. Some pictures of the final results. Got you
[04:09.890 --> 04:16.410]  know a gang of colas there covered in trichomes. I love how the fade looks.
[04:16.410 --> 04:21.810]  Purple colors, dense. The smell was on point. I'm not gonna say it's the road
[04:21.850 --> 04:26.970]  kill skunk but it definitely had some earthy funk to it. I enjoy it. I'm smoking
[04:26.970 --> 04:33.730]  it right now and it's a good one everybody. Nice mellow body stone. Kind of
[04:33.730 --> 04:38.450]  take you to another place. But thanks for checking it out.
