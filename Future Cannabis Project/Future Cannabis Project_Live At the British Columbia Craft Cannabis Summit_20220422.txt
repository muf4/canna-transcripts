[00:00.000 --> 00:02.000]  We're doing an introduction.
[00:03.000 --> 00:05.000]  And we're live!
[00:06.000 --> 00:07.000]  Hey!
[00:07.000 --> 00:08.000]  Brand new.
[00:08.000 --> 00:12.000]  You know, we're creators and look at the opportunity we have.
[00:13.000 --> 00:15.000]  Just a second, I gotta adjust the microphone.
[00:16.000 --> 00:18.000]  I'm extremely excited for what we do.
[00:19.000 --> 00:25.000]  And particularly musicians, because you're a part of such a platform.
[00:27.000 --> 00:28.000]  It was off.
[00:28.000 --> 00:29.000]  What?
[00:29.000 --> 00:31.000]  We're live, goes together.
[00:35.000 --> 00:38.000]  Okay, so we are back on the Future Cannabis Project.
[00:38.000 --> 00:40.000]  Very honoured to be here.
[00:40.000 --> 00:41.000]  Again, my name is Andrew Gordon.
[00:41.000 --> 00:45.000]  I get the great privilege of serving as Vice President of BC Craft Farmers Co-op.
[00:45.000 --> 00:49.000]  We are hosting this wonderful party in conjunction with our amazing partners at Acres,
[00:49.000 --> 00:52.000]  the Association of Canadian Cannabis Retailers.
[00:53.000 --> 00:55.000]  That's a lot of seats.
[00:55.000 --> 00:57.000]  It doesn't fit on one business card.
[00:57.000 --> 00:59.000]  We have a lot of business cards.
[00:59.000 --> 01:01.000]  Shout out to Jacqueline and the whole team there.
[01:01.000 --> 01:02.000]  It's been absolutely incredible.
[01:02.000 --> 01:05.000]  This event has been a culmination of so much hard work.
[01:06.000 --> 01:08.000]  And so timely and poignant.
[01:08.000 --> 01:09.000]  Is this the first?
[01:09.000 --> 01:10.000]  In the inaugural?
[01:10.000 --> 01:11.000]  It is.
[01:11.000 --> 01:12.000]  The Eldorado Hotel, shout out to them.
[01:12.000 --> 01:16.000]  Shout out to Dutchie and Weed Pool, our sponsors at Stepped Up and On Fleet.
[01:16.000 --> 01:18.000]  Really making this all possible.
[01:18.000 --> 01:20.000]  You know, again, these events aren't free.
[01:20.000 --> 01:21.000]  They are an investment.
[01:21.000 --> 01:25.000]  And again, being able to draw so many amazing people here.
[01:25.000 --> 01:26.000]  And you are among them.
[01:26.000 --> 01:29.000]  Let me tell you, we rocked it out in venue one time.
[01:29.000 --> 01:30.000]  Is venue still open?
[01:30.000 --> 01:33.000]  Well, I mean, it's under trying times, but I believe yes.
[01:33.000 --> 01:35.000]  Granville Street is open and thriving again.
[01:35.000 --> 01:36.000]  Good, good, good.
[01:36.000 --> 01:39.000]  I hadn't noticed going by whether it was still open or not.
[01:39.000 --> 01:40.000]  Yeah.
[01:40.000 --> 01:41.000]  Yeah, that was a great show.
[01:41.000 --> 01:42.000]  It was an incredible time.
[01:42.000 --> 01:46.000]  We got to launch a fun cannabis brand and just really bring the whole community together
[01:46.000 --> 01:48.000]  during a time where, you know, Lyft is in town.
[01:48.000 --> 01:52.000]  You have to celebrate, get the best people and brightest people in the room together.
[01:52.000 --> 01:53.000]  And Ian helped us do that.
[01:53.000 --> 01:58.000]  You know, Ian, you've been working on the event and entertainment side of things for a long time.
[01:58.000 --> 02:03.000]  And with Loopool here leading the way, maybe we can just share a little insight on Loopool.
[02:03.000 --> 02:09.000]  Supporting creators and what the mission is there and how that ties into this fantastic individual to your right here.
[02:09.000 --> 02:15.000]  Yeah, I mean, like it's kind of the coming together of, I think, like all of my experiences in the past
[02:15.000 --> 02:17.000]  from doing stuff in music and also being in cannabis.
[02:17.000 --> 02:22.000]  I mean, look, what we really needed to do was we needed to do something that was going to be connecting music and cannabis
[02:22.000 --> 02:24.000]  and do something that was just genuinely meaningful.
[02:24.000 --> 02:29.000]  Like we had to do something that was going beyond like the celebrity, you know, putting Trailer Park Buds,
[02:29.000 --> 02:32.000]  Trailer Park Boys or something like that on there.
[02:32.000 --> 02:36.000]  So, you know, what I really wanted to sort of see was like I had been through the machine of the system,
[02:36.000 --> 02:40.000]  understanding just how challenging it is for artists and just how difficult the system is.
[02:40.000 --> 02:42.000]  And something had to come along and change it.
[02:42.000 --> 02:45.000]  And the way to do it is the artists have to come on board as co-founders.
[02:45.000 --> 02:49.000]  And it was really cool to get to build such an eclectic group that everybody, whether it's, you know,
[02:49.000 --> 02:54.000]  stars on the alternative side or division on the R&B side, everyone's all united on, you know,
[02:54.000 --> 02:57.000]  seeing the potential that cannabis can make a difference for the next gen of artists.
[02:57.000 --> 03:02.000]  Like how often does a new billion dollar industry come along that it has the potential to really make a difference?
[03:02.000 --> 03:05.000]  Yeah, I agree, to inspire and to galvanize and to change.
[03:05.000 --> 03:10.000]  And I look at, you know, the power that music has to really resonate with people and to destigmatize
[03:10.000 --> 03:15.000]  and really harness the potentiality of the aims and aspirations of what legalization represents.
[03:15.000 --> 03:21.000]  And I'm so encouraged that a brand like yours is rising and coming to the table and really creating a unique exchange
[03:21.000 --> 03:27.000]  between artists who are creative, who in many cases use cannabis to get charged up, to get creative,
[03:27.000 --> 03:30.000]  to get imaginative about what they're doing or to relax.
[03:30.000 --> 03:32.000]  That's it. It's also a stressful industry. That's not to deny.
[03:32.000 --> 03:35.000]  Cannabis has saved me on a number of occasions at this event.
[03:35.000 --> 03:39.000]  I think that one of the biggest things though is we want to find a way to be able to put emotion into cannabis.
[03:39.000 --> 03:43.000]  Like it's really been made so difficult like by design, right?
[03:43.000 --> 03:45.000]  But it is such like an emotional product.
[03:45.000 --> 03:49.000]  Like we got to find little ways that you actually can compliantly make those touch points.
[03:49.000 --> 03:54.000]  This is the thing for me. I don't know anything about business at all.
[03:54.000 --> 03:59.000]  That's why I'm a musician because I enjoy getting screwed for a living.
[03:59.000 --> 04:01.000]  And I can't play the triangle.
[04:01.000 --> 04:05.000]  But I do know that like my life has been music and weed.
[04:05.000 --> 04:11.000]  Like those two things are inextricably forever linked in my world.
[04:11.000 --> 04:14.000]  And weed's helped me understand music better.
[04:14.000 --> 04:16.000]  It's helped me be a better musician.
[04:16.000 --> 04:19.000]  And it's helped me meet people all over the world.
[04:19.000 --> 04:25.000]  The number of times like I've stood in an alleyway with a bunch of kids and smoked a joint and talked about life.
[04:25.000 --> 04:35.000]  Like I agree with Ian that there is this ineffable part of marijuana that isn't like drinking or anything else.
[04:35.000 --> 04:36.000]  It is a chalice.
[04:36.000 --> 04:44.000]  It is a way of being with people in an open way and opening yourself to not just to music but to nature, to color,
[04:44.000 --> 04:50.000]  to all of the things around us that are not just a little blank, you know, blinking screen.
[04:50.000 --> 04:55.000]  Like I think there is a real analog nature to weed.
[04:55.000 --> 04:58.000]  And that part of it is precious.
[04:58.000 --> 05:03.000]  And it's hard to explain to people because we're not being allowed to at the moment.
[05:03.000 --> 05:09.000]  So definitely for musicians in a world where it's getting harder and harder to make a living as a musician,
[05:09.000 --> 05:12.000]  we have to put our hustle out everywhere.
[05:12.000 --> 05:16.000]  And like cannabis is such a natural place for musicians to be.
[05:16.000 --> 05:19.000]  It just seems totally like, of course, you know.
[05:19.000 --> 05:20.000]  They're comfortable.
[05:20.000 --> 05:23.000]  Well, it's one of two things I know something about.
[05:23.000 --> 05:25.000]  But I mean like look, it does always go hand in hand.
[05:25.000 --> 05:28.000]  Like it is really the most natural pairing of like cannabis and music.
[05:28.000 --> 05:30.000]  Like that's what it's always been from the dawn of time, right?
[05:30.000 --> 05:31.000]  Yeah, it's like coffee and cream.
[05:31.000 --> 05:32.000]  Exactly, yeah.
[05:33.000 --> 05:35.000]  Yeah, exactly.
[05:35.000 --> 05:36.000]  But it is exactly that.
[05:36.000 --> 05:38.000]  It's exactly like coffee and cream, you know.
[05:38.000 --> 05:41.000]  It's just ridiculous.
[05:41.000 --> 05:44.000]  Like this is the only way that we're able to put those two touch points together.
[05:44.000 --> 05:49.000]  You know, one thing I think is going to be, you know, such a breath of fresh air around your brand
[05:49.000 --> 05:55.000]  is the opportunity that retailers and producers who really want to get out there and tell the story
[05:55.000 --> 05:58.000]  and connect and be heard is this activation element.
[05:58.000 --> 06:02.000]  And I find, you know, the experiential component of Loopool the most compelling,
[06:02.000 --> 06:05.000]  along with the great work you're doing, obviously, to support up-and-coming artists.
[06:05.000 --> 06:09.000]  But, you know, we get so few opportunities, especially over the last two years,
[06:09.000 --> 06:13.000]  to connect, to engage, and to be charged up and really be entertained.
[06:13.000 --> 06:17.000]  And I think this activation component with cannabis tied into it is something that is uniquely,
[06:17.000 --> 06:20.000]  is a unique differentiator for Loopool.
[06:20.000 --> 06:22.000]  And so give me a sense of the strategy here.
[06:22.000 --> 06:24.000]  Now you've got products in market.
[06:25.000 --> 06:29.000]  And now you have, you know, an amazing array of artists behind you that can support this mission.
[06:29.000 --> 06:32.000]  What is activation and Loopool going to look like?
[06:32.000 --> 06:36.000]  So I think what it's going to look like is we kind of have a realistic crawl walk run approach to this,
[06:36.000 --> 06:42.000]  which is right now what it is, is we want to see how we can be adding a lot of value to other people's initiatives.
[06:42.000 --> 06:46.000]  So, you know, we wanted to start to see how we can be adding value to other people's initiatives.
[06:46.000 --> 06:49.000]  Like when we do things in store,
[06:50.000 --> 06:52.000]  We got it's all there.
[06:53.000 --> 06:56.000]  I feel like we should be sparking up one of our own joints right now as well.
[06:56.000 --> 06:58.000]  This is like, we definitely should be.
[06:58.000 --> 07:00.000]  We do. Yes.
[07:00.000 --> 07:04.000]  So, only the Loopool.
[07:04.000 --> 07:06.000]  I got the exclusive one here.
[07:09.000 --> 07:12.000]  So look, the important thing is when you want to just talk about cannabis retail and everything,
[07:12.000 --> 07:14.000]  here's the savage honest truth.
[07:14.000 --> 07:17.000]  Like every single store is going to be selling the same products, right?
[07:17.000 --> 07:20.000]  So everyone is trying to be able to differentiate by selling the exact same widgets.
[07:20.000 --> 07:23.000]  So you're either competing on price or competing on experience.
[07:23.000 --> 07:29.000]  You need to be doing things that are allowing people to come into stores and to do unique things that bring artisan and cool experiences.
[07:29.000 --> 07:32.000]  Like that's what it really comes down to, man.
[07:32.000 --> 07:34.000]  Everyone sells the exact same widget.
[07:34.000 --> 07:39.000]  So what are brands doing for retailers to actually like bring people into the stores to help with their stores on the map to be doing different things?
[07:39.000 --> 07:42.000]  Like, again, it's a fundamental problem of it.
[07:42.000 --> 07:44.000]  If they all sell the exact same thing and they can't advertise,
[07:45.000 --> 07:48.000]  then there's very few people that can help make a difference and make them stand out.
[07:48.000 --> 07:50.000]  And then you got to differentiate through people and purpose.
[07:50.000 --> 07:57.000]  And again, that brings me back to Loopool's differentiators here in terms of strengths and real kind of core values that I think people are really going to align with.
[07:57.000 --> 08:05.000]  And the spectrum of music you brought to the table to the stakeholder base you can engage and pull from and activate within,
[08:05.000 --> 08:10.000]  I think is tremendous now that we're moving forward into an age where we're beginning to get our legs under us in cannabis a bit.
[08:11.000 --> 08:15.000]  The craft industry is really teaching us that small scale is the way to go.
[08:15.000 --> 08:17.000]  And there's a powerful narrative there.
[08:17.000 --> 08:23.000]  And I think artists more connect with that because they tried Khalifa with Seven Acres and they tried Snoop with Tweed.
[08:23.000 --> 08:27.000]  I don't want to smoke Bill Blair's fucking weed, man.
[08:27.000 --> 08:28.000]  You know what I mean?
[08:28.000 --> 08:29.000]  I hear you.
[08:29.000 --> 08:30.000]  That shit is dank.
[08:30.000 --> 08:35.000]  But an artist can contribute to a mission around a product, not just the product itself.
[08:35.000 --> 08:37.000]  And that's where again, Loopool offers that.
[08:38.000 --> 08:46.000]  But what I really want, honestly, what I would love to see actually come of Loopool is for us to be starting a greater mission of showing people about how you can differentiate by making a difference.
[08:46.000 --> 08:51.000]  If you can't differentiate on the product, then you need to be able to differentiate on the mission.
[08:51.000 --> 08:59.000]  And in the same way of us giving back to artists, there are organizations that can be giving back to LGBTQ rights or different things like that as a way to stand out.
[08:59.000 --> 09:02.000]  Use a portion of your proceeds and give it back to the Trevor Project, things like that.
[09:02.000 --> 09:06.000]  These are the kind of ways you're able to stand out and you're able to be social for it at the same time.
[09:06.000 --> 09:10.000]  It's the win-win that I think this industry is desperately needing to find.
[09:10.000 --> 09:13.000]  And I think people aren't trying to be creative enough to go for it.
[09:13.000 --> 09:16.000]  One of the cool things about the weed industry is it's brand new.
[09:16.000 --> 09:21.000]  So it's not too late to build integrity into the process.
[09:21.000 --> 09:27.000]  It's not too late to create systems that are fair or equitable or work for everybody.
[09:27.000 --> 09:34.000]  Whereas, you know, with so many other industries, it's like, oh, we can't make it okay because it's been fucked for ages and that's the way it works.
[09:34.000 --> 09:36.000]  It doesn't have to be like that.
[09:36.000 --> 09:47.000]  So the opportunity to do this with Ian for a band like us, we've been around 20 years, we're looking for other ways to be involved as a band in things.
[09:47.000 --> 09:51.000]  And it was it's it's an amazing open door.
[09:51.000 --> 09:53.000]  And as Ian says, you could do with anything.
[09:53.000 --> 09:57.000]  You could do it with you could get yourself involved in the food industry.
[09:57.000 --> 10:00.000]  You could support young chefs. You could support young painters.
[10:00.000 --> 10:07.000]  You could, you know, anyone who's doing something new could be involved in the act of creating a brand that people want to buy.
[10:07.000 --> 10:11.000]  If you can't if you can't differentiate in the product, then differentiate in your mission.
[10:11.000 --> 10:15.000]  Like that's like that's it. That's really it.
[10:15.000 --> 10:19.000]  Honestly, I think what people resonate with at the end of the day is is your values.
[10:19.000 --> 10:25.000]  They want to, you know, ascribe themselves to something that really does fundamentally connect.
[10:26.000 --> 10:31.000]  And that again, music is that is that is that common ground, that wonderful vector just allows for that.
[10:31.000 --> 10:33.000]  Especially with weed, right? Yeah.
[10:33.000 --> 10:45.000]  In my life, the people who have been I've traveled all over the world and before it was legal and still not legal, as I'm sure I'm looking around all you guys know, you get to town, you're like, oh, now I've got to find some fucking weed.
[10:46.000 --> 10:56.000]  You talk to the sound guy and you talk to the roadie and like, but eventually someone will hook you up with for no reason, not because they're getting anything out of it, just because they're nice.
[10:56.000 --> 11:02.000]  Someone will come and sell you some really nice weed and they'll be pretty cheap, you know, and people will share it.
[11:02.000 --> 11:11.000]  It's not something you hoard. It's the entire experience of weed from day one for me has been about people being together and sharing the experience.
[11:11.000 --> 11:14.000]  It's like nobody fucking hogs a joint. You know what I mean?
[11:14.000 --> 11:16.000]  It's not the way it works.
[11:16.000 --> 11:17.000]  We called out real quick.
[11:17.000 --> 11:24.000]  Yeah. You know, and there's something like endemically good about it that I think is exploitable.
[11:24.000 --> 11:27.000]  I think it's like it's such a social icebreaker as well.
[11:27.000 --> 11:31.000]  Like it's one of those things where it's like it's one of those ways that like somebody lets their guard down.
[11:31.000 --> 11:35.000]  You kind of get more real and getting to know somebody like that is the one really cool thing about it.
[11:35.000 --> 11:41.000]  We're like if you start drinking a lot with somebody like, look, you're going to have fun memories, whatever, but you get like sloshed a little ridiculous.
[11:41.000 --> 11:45.000]  I find that weed is just a very simple, easy icebreaker as well in our society.
[11:45.000 --> 11:48.000]  Like I don't know, it's just a very Canadian thing, too.
[11:48.000 --> 11:55.000]  So I'd love to pivot real quick because you mentioned, you know, a powerful word there about really what is creating success and so many outcomes and it's involved.
[11:55.000 --> 12:07.000]  And a big part of what this represents is just coming together, being involved in discussion, in idea exchange, in advocacy that, you know, again, we build consensus around.
[12:07.000 --> 12:12.000]  And, you know, there's moments in concerts where you just feel everyone's energy come together and it's like one.
[12:12.000 --> 12:16.000]  And I felt that last night here where we were all in a room together.
[12:16.000 --> 12:17.000]  It was actually the AR Cannabis Awards.
[12:17.000 --> 12:18.000]  Shout out to AR Cannabis.
[12:18.000 --> 12:21.000]  They threw a hell of a party.
[12:21.000 --> 12:22.000]  And it was the most magical feeling in the world.
[12:22.000 --> 12:23.000]  It felt like a concert.
[12:23.000 --> 12:25.000]  My wife and I were talking about we haven't been to a concert ever.
[12:25.000 --> 12:26.000]  We gotta go.
[12:26.000 --> 12:27.000]  Like you're coming, right?
[12:27.000 --> 12:30.000]  Like that energy is just like the most uniting, binding force.
[12:30.000 --> 12:32.000]  And it just is so pure.
[12:32.000 --> 12:33.000]  And there's a moment where you just understand.
[12:33.000 --> 12:37.000]  And Cannabis brings that to me in waves and moments all the time.
[12:37.000 --> 12:41.000]  But it's when I'm together with people like right now, like look at this deck, look at the sunshine, look at this moment.
[12:41.000 --> 12:42.000]  I'd love to know your impression.
[12:42.000 --> 12:44.000]  This is our inaugural event.
[12:44.000 --> 12:49.000]  But I mean, we selected this place really based on the ability to chill and stretch out and not feel so crunched and convinced.
[12:49.000 --> 12:52.000]  There's been a lot of that in conferencing.
[12:52.000 --> 12:53.000]  And this is different.
[12:53.000 --> 12:56.000]  And programming wise, there's definitely been a couple of hiccups.
[12:56.000 --> 12:58.000]  But at the end of the day, people are vibing and chilling.
[12:58.000 --> 13:00.000]  And this is a relaxed venue and setting.
[13:00.000 --> 13:01.000]  Extremely relaxed.
[13:01.000 --> 13:04.000]  What's your impression been so far of the inaugural summit here in Cologne?
[13:04.000 --> 13:07.000]  Well, my wife and I have never been to a conference because I'm not a business person.
[13:07.000 --> 13:09.000]  I've never like done this before.
[13:09.000 --> 13:10.000]  Thank you for doing it.
[13:10.000 --> 13:14.000]  So we were sort of worried that it would be like guys in chinos and everyone.
[13:14.000 --> 13:15.000]  But it, of course, isn't.
[13:15.000 --> 13:16.000]  Because it's weed people.
[13:16.000 --> 13:17.000]  Wonderful.
[13:17.000 --> 13:21.000]  So we've had such a beautiful time.
[13:21.000 --> 13:22.000]  And everyone's so nice.
[13:22.000 --> 13:25.000]  It's such a genuine down to earth feeling.
[13:25.000 --> 13:29.000]  And you know what's nice about it is it feels like everyone's in this thing.
[13:29.000 --> 13:32.000]  Everyone has their particular area they're working within.
[13:32.000 --> 13:36.000]  And everybody's rising together or falling together.
[13:36.000 --> 13:38.000]  And everybody knows it.
[13:38.000 --> 13:40.000]  So it's like mutual support.
[13:40.000 --> 13:42.000]  Everyone's interested in what each other's doing.
[13:42.000 --> 13:47.000]  It feels very new and very idealistic and beautiful.
[13:47.000 --> 13:49.000]  And I hope that energy.
[13:49.000 --> 13:55.000]  The thing is how do you grow something and keep that core of goodness in it?
[13:55.000 --> 13:57.000]  That's the real trick.
[13:57.000 --> 14:02.000]  And that goes back to like building integrity into the ground floor of it so that you.
[14:02.000 --> 14:03.000]  It's just there.
[14:03.000 --> 14:09.000]  And I think this is a good long way to establishing that at least amongst this community of people.
[14:09.000 --> 14:10.000]  Thank you.
[14:10.000 --> 14:11.000]  People are nice.
[14:11.000 --> 14:12.000]  Be nice.
[14:12.000 --> 14:13.000]  That's all.
[14:13.000 --> 14:14.000]  Just be nice.
[14:14.000 --> 14:15.000]  It's really simple.
[14:15.000 --> 14:16.000]  It's also like a totally different.
[14:16.000 --> 14:17.000]  Yeah.
[14:17.000 --> 14:18.000]  Be a family.
[14:18.000 --> 14:21.000]  I was at a conference as well about an amazing product that we all love to enjoy and consume together.
[14:21.000 --> 14:22.000]  This isn't like insurance.
[14:22.000 --> 14:24.000]  There's like the state farm guy and the all state guy.
[14:24.000 --> 14:27.000]  And it's just like, oh, we got to figure out who the guy's clients are.
[14:27.000 --> 14:29.000]  It's hard to find passion inside that.
[14:29.000 --> 14:30.000]  Yeah.
[14:30.000 --> 14:32.000]  That's actually what's really cool and exciting.
[14:32.000 --> 14:34.000]  We enjoy what we do.
[14:34.000 --> 14:36.000]  Figuratively and literally.
[14:36.000 --> 14:37.000]  So let's jump into that.
[14:37.000 --> 14:38.000]  What are you doing?
[14:38.000 --> 14:39.000]  What is coming up?
[14:39.000 --> 14:40.000]  What is next?
[14:40.000 --> 14:45.000]  I asked a little bit about the activation because I am eager to hear how as you enter into new markets.
[14:45.000 --> 14:46.000]  What is the strategy?
[14:46.000 --> 14:51.000]  Because you have just this array in your toolbox of amazing people you can bring to the table at any given time.
[14:51.000 --> 14:52.000]  Some great products.
[14:52.000 --> 14:53.000]  Great formats.
[14:53.000 --> 14:54.000]  What are we looking at here?
[14:54.000 --> 14:56.000]  I know you're always on the hunt for crafts.
[14:56.000 --> 15:01.000]  I hope you're getting out and meeting a lot of small scale producers here because we want to be loophole what they need.
[15:01.000 --> 15:04.000]  So what we think that there's a really cool opportunity on.
[15:04.000 --> 15:14.000]  I actually wanted to talk about this afterwards as well too because we're sort of looking at it right now, which is we really think that there's a huge opportunity to do some really cool limited edition artist co-cons.
[15:15.000 --> 15:28.000]  Branded opportunities because in the way that you can't say, like as an example, you can't call it Our Lady Peace Sativa, but you could call it spiritual Sativa.
[15:28.000 --> 15:31.000]  If there are spiritual machines, I'm just oversimplifying it.
[15:31.000 --> 15:45.000]  But what we want to be able to do is I really want to be able to create some limited edition ultra premium products like the idea of being here wanting to source great products from great people and to be able to sort of curate this around unique times in the artist album cycle.
[15:45.000 --> 15:49.000]  I think that for our end as well, we also look at it as a business model where...
[15:49.000 --> 15:52.000]  Like on tour in the studio type stuff or it's like the different...
[15:53.000 --> 16:00.000]  You know how much of a fucking game changer it would be if at a merch table in California you could sell your own strain?
[16:00.000 --> 16:07.000]  I mean, it's literally a question of paying for the entire tour with that.
[16:07.000 --> 16:10.000]  If people had that available to buy.
[16:10.000 --> 16:15.000]  And it's so ridiculous that there is this continues to be...
[16:16.000 --> 16:28.000]  You know, I remember from law class in high school, like laws are made by people whose social norms are of one kind and they make that which is not their social norm illegal.
[16:28.000 --> 16:31.000]  So cannabis was made illegal by a bunch of alcoholics.
[16:31.000 --> 16:33.000]  It's like they didn't give a shit.
[16:33.000 --> 16:35.000]  The cotton industry wanted to make its money.
[16:35.000 --> 16:37.000]  And so they banned it because it was...
[16:37.000 --> 16:39.000]  They didn't need it in their life.
[16:39.000 --> 16:45.000]  But now it's become part of the people who are in power now have smoked weed.
[16:45.000 --> 16:53.000]  And so we have to start to get them to drop this phony moralism, pretending that we use other drugs.
[16:53.000 --> 16:55.000]  You know, it's not like other drugs.
[16:55.000 --> 17:00.000]  And so if you had that, then suddenly like, yeah, you could.
[17:00.000 --> 17:04.000]  I mean, in the States, Snoop Dogg and those guys, they have that ability to like...
[17:04.000 --> 17:06.000]  I just hope in Canada.
[17:06.000 --> 17:09.000]  But it's hard because look at with beer, right?
[17:09.000 --> 17:14.000]  When I was a kid, the only beer you could buy was Molson, Carlsberg, Labatt Blue.
[17:14.000 --> 17:16.000]  That was it, man.
[17:16.000 --> 17:18.000]  And then suddenly it was like Sleeman came along.
[17:18.000 --> 17:21.000]  Everybody freaked out because there was one microbrewery.
[17:21.000 --> 17:29.000]  And now you go into the grocery store and you're like, how the hell am I supposed to figure out which of these 700 IPAs I'm supposed to buy?
[17:29.000 --> 17:39.000]  So it's like, you know, I think cannabis just has to be allowed to turn into something that is local and multiple, you know, multitudes.
[17:39.000 --> 17:42.000]  Variety is the key.
[17:42.000 --> 17:47.000]  We're going to answer that by the way, just specifically to like the craft thing with BC and like with the reason why we're here.
[17:47.000 --> 17:52.000]  Like, I think that there are people here who are growing incredible next level cannabis.
[17:52.000 --> 17:54.000]  It's the best weed in the world.
[17:55.000 --> 18:02.000]  But like when we're in this like crazy world where there's like hundreds of brands and it's so like even again, you could have the best stuff.
[18:02.000 --> 18:05.000]  Even somebody who doesn't will say that they do as well.
[18:05.000 --> 18:22.000]  Like the ability to actually help your great product be sold, be sold on a recurring basis and being able to help companies be able to like if you grew amazing stuff, then wouldn't you want that to be like recurring selling and to be able to grow your business from one greenhouse to two if it's a really, really great product.
[18:22.000 --> 18:28.000]  And it's the opportunity to partner with brands that are connecting with people and are working with people like the independents like us.
[18:28.000 --> 18:30.000]  Because like for us, we don't grow the product.
[18:30.000 --> 18:32.000]  We source great product from great people.
[18:32.000 --> 18:43.000]  I think that we can be like that amazing connection between amazing local craft growers and like bringing big strains and like bringing them to larger scale by doing these kinds of unique opportunities.
[18:43.000 --> 18:45.000]  And you'll feel the love in it as well, too.
[18:45.000 --> 18:48.000]  Like I think there's a huge, huge, huge opportunity.
[18:49.000 --> 18:54.000]  I think we're really just still victim of circumstance in terms of how new the industry is.
[18:54.000 --> 18:58.000]  Like we just see, you know, how long it take liquor to get to where it is at.
[18:58.000 --> 19:08.000]  Right. Like we got a long way to go to build the community confidence around that type of free exchange in terms of on site consumption and integration with a whole bunch of other different types of business models.
[19:09.000 --> 19:13.000]  Where artists can really benefit from that plurality of products that our industry offers out the gate.
[19:13.000 --> 19:18.000]  And the kind of experience you're looking for in terms of your exchange with your audience, too.
[19:18.000 --> 19:20.000]  Because alcohol, things can get pretty rough sometimes.
[19:20.000 --> 19:24.000]  And an audience with cannabis, much more enjoyable and manageable, I would imagine.
[19:24.000 --> 19:25.000]  Absolutely.
[19:25.000 --> 19:29.000]  I think one of the most frustrating things, by the way, is when you see like, OK, so I'm from Ontario.
[19:29.000 --> 19:31.000]  They just legalized like online gambling there.
[19:31.000 --> 19:34.000]  You literally can't go anywhere now without seeing an advertisement.
[19:34.000 --> 19:36.000]  They advertise it every 30 seconds.
[19:36.000 --> 19:39.000]  Everywhere now. It's just the gambling, gambling, gambling.
[19:39.000 --> 19:42.000]  Then there's like the LCBO who buys ads for the government.
[19:42.000 --> 19:45.000]  Like the hypocrisies of the things that are happening right now.
[19:45.000 --> 19:50.000]  They're having all these like alcohol ads everywhere and you couldn't even advertise a CBD drink right now.
[19:50.000 --> 19:52.000]  It's a little.
[19:52.000 --> 19:54.000]  Well, we need to have a reckoning.
[19:54.000 --> 19:55.000]  That's why we're here.
[19:55.000 --> 19:57.000]  A major, major reason of that.
[19:57.000 --> 20:01.000]  We're doing lots of surveying and polling during the entire extent of the conference.
[20:01.000 --> 20:03.000]  And we did some preliminary leading up to it.
[20:03.000 --> 20:10.000]  And we're really trying to aggregate data and insight direct from first hand stakeholders in the industry.
[20:10.000 --> 20:24.000]  Representative, diverse, inclusive, and really focused on issues that are really bottlenecking opportunities to really welcome what you're describing here in terms of that type of freedom of exchange in a whole bunch of different settings.
[20:24.000 --> 20:27.000]  So, you know, we've got a long, long way to go still.
[20:27.000 --> 20:28.000]  But it starts here.
[20:28.000 --> 20:30.000]  And, you know, the data we're aggregating here.
[20:30.000 --> 20:33.000]  We've had the stakeholders come here, the secretary at the VCLDB, the LCRB.
[20:33.000 --> 20:34.000]  They're listening.
[20:34.000 --> 20:35.000]  They're learning.
[20:35.000 --> 20:36.000]  They're presenting.
[20:36.000 --> 20:37.000]  They're sharing ideas.
[20:37.000 --> 20:44.000]  And I'm seeing a softening of kind of bureaucratic inertia in a lot of ways because they're beginning to get a sight line on who the industry is.
[20:44.000 --> 20:45.000]  And they're actually coming out.
[20:45.000 --> 20:48.000]  And they can't come out if you don't offer an opportunity for them to do that.
[20:48.000 --> 20:49.000]  Much like a concert.
[20:49.000 --> 20:50.000]  Right?
[20:50.000 --> 20:51.000]  As an artist.
[20:51.000 --> 20:53.000]  They don't get to know you until you're rocking it on stage.
[20:53.000 --> 20:55.000]  You know what I mean?
[20:55.000 --> 20:56.000]  You've got to get that emotional reaction.
[20:56.000 --> 20:59.000]  Zoom calls are not the way to create a business model.
[20:59.000 --> 21:00.000]  Can I ask this, by the way?
[21:00.000 --> 21:04.000]  What do you think we as a business, we advocate and what we're trying to be able to push for.
[21:04.000 --> 21:06.000]  What can civilians do?
[21:06.000 --> 21:08.000]  What can individuals try to do?
[21:08.000 --> 21:10.000]  Is it like writing your MP?
[21:10.000 --> 21:11.000]  That's definitely part of it.
[21:11.000 --> 21:14.000]  But is there the time and the place around elections?
[21:14.000 --> 21:17.000]  Vote with your wallet at the end of the day.
[21:17.000 --> 21:19.000]  If I can say anything.
[21:19.000 --> 21:25.000]  And that's why a brand like yours in converting and creating that affinity and recognition and momentum and experience is so important.
[21:25.000 --> 21:27.000]  Because they will keep coming back to you.
[21:27.000 --> 21:29.000]  It's really easy in cannabis to make one sale.
[21:29.000 --> 21:31.000]  Right?
[21:31.000 --> 21:33.000]  You can have fool's gold all over the place.
[21:33.000 --> 21:36.000]  And getting that second purchase is all around why you resonate with that product.
[21:36.000 --> 21:38.000]  And again, it has to be a multitude of things.
[21:38.000 --> 21:39.000]  It's price point.
[21:39.000 --> 21:41.000]  It's positioning on the shelf sometimes.
[21:41.000 --> 21:43.000]  There's a lot of psychological and physical factors involved.
[21:43.000 --> 21:46.000]  But at the end of the day, it's the people that drive it before the product.
[21:46.000 --> 21:53.000]  And I think this is where I think as an activation strategy and as an individual, just be out there, be present, be involved.
[21:54.000 --> 21:58.000]  And so, when you guys look to go advance your brands in the market, it's not just concerts.
[21:58.000 --> 22:02.000]  It's not just co-branding products and material.
[22:02.000 --> 22:04.000]  It's literally going out and visiting the people.
[22:04.000 --> 22:11.000]  You being here is creating recognition and profile and interest in Loophole because I got to meet you and talk to you about this vision and this plan.
[22:11.000 --> 22:15.000]  And this idea of supporting emerging artists and how important that is.
[22:15.000 --> 22:16.000]  We're all here trying to do that too.
[22:17.000 --> 22:23.000]  Breed that next generation of just intense, informed advocates that are emboldened and passionate in what they do.
[22:23.000 --> 22:25.000]  And that is all I want to see.
[22:25.000 --> 22:27.000]  And so, when music comes into that, way better.
[22:27.000 --> 22:30.000]  I mean we didn't have music on the rooftop before 20.
[22:30.000 --> 22:33.000]  And then we did downstairs and the vibe was way better downstairs.
[22:33.000 --> 22:35.000]  You can't miss music ever.
[22:35.000 --> 22:39.000]  And so, not to see it represented in an authentic way is so like, huh.
[22:39.000 --> 22:40.000]  It's not just authentic.
[22:40.000 --> 22:41.000]  I think that was the really big thing.
[22:41.000 --> 22:42.000]  It was authentic.
[22:42.000 --> 22:45.000]  It was just lacking that.
[22:45.000 --> 22:46.000]  It was just absolutely lacking that.
[22:46.000 --> 22:48.000]  And again, I come back to it.
[22:48.000 --> 22:52.000]  The really cool opportunity, I think, if you look at how fast this industry moves now.
[22:52.000 --> 22:56.000]  People who are sourcing the really, really great local BC craft stuff.
[22:56.000 --> 23:06.000]  We think we have a really great opportunity to help make that product become big, get the scale, get the size, really position it like cookies and really build this into a lit thing.
[23:06.000 --> 23:11.000]  But you do it, I would hope, in a very granular way.
[23:12.000 --> 23:15.000]  And really work with, don't be afraid to work with a lot of different producers.
[23:15.000 --> 23:17.000]  Even on the same strain.
[23:17.000 --> 23:19.000]  But be honest about the variety and the pheno.
[23:19.000 --> 23:21.000]  And just talk about the grower.
[23:21.000 --> 23:29.000]  People understand that every time you take a seed or cutting or whatever you're doing and you grow it under your conditions, under your methodology, it's different every time.
[23:29.000 --> 23:31.000]  And so, really lean into that.
[23:31.000 --> 23:38.000]  And the artists, I think, if you look at the compliance framework and how restrictive it is, it's more based around like, everyone's focused on the product.
[23:38.000 --> 23:40.000]  Focus on the purpose and the passion of the people.
[23:40.000 --> 23:42.000]  And just talk about it.
[23:42.000 --> 23:43.000]  Don't sell it.
[23:43.000 --> 23:45.000]  So, I don't know anything about this.
[23:45.000 --> 23:47.000]  But my wife, we were talking yesterday.
[23:47.000 --> 23:57.000]  And she was like, if I could be guaranteed of how I felt every time I smoked a certain amount, I would do it way more often.
[23:57.000 --> 24:00.000]  But she said to me, you're always saying to me, oh, this one's really chill.
[24:00.000 --> 24:01.000]  Don't worry.
[24:01.000 --> 24:04.000]  And I take a puff and I'm like totally fucking high.
[24:05.000 --> 24:13.000]  What in the science, what possibilities are there to make that happen with THC?
[24:13.000 --> 24:14.000]  You're hearing now.
[24:14.000 --> 24:16.000]  I mean, you look at the product formats that are coming out now.
[24:16.000 --> 24:27.000]  This is where I was always so excited about legalization, actually, as a person that came from legacy because I knew the sophistication and the science behind what we could do once legalization integrated and allowed for commercial capacity.
[24:27.000 --> 24:29.000]  We would just, all the products would take off.
[24:29.000 --> 24:31.000]  Because they're not going to be made in a bucket in some guy's whatever.
[24:31.000 --> 24:32.000]  Right?
[24:32.000 --> 24:35.000]  These are proper labs, proper facilities, GMP, GPP.
[24:35.000 --> 24:38.000]  They're going to be putting a banging fire on the shelf.
[24:38.000 --> 24:42.000]  And they're going to be in formats that are going to be accessible to more consumers.
[24:42.000 --> 24:43.000]  Right?
[24:43.000 --> 24:45.000]  So your wife may like a drink with like nano emulsion.
[24:45.000 --> 24:47.000]  So just the onset and offset are really quick.
[24:47.000 --> 24:52.000]  Like you can have a 90 minute experience on a very set milligram count because there's going to be no wavering from that.
[24:52.000 --> 24:55.000]  You like 2.5, you like 5, you like 10, you like 20.
[24:55.000 --> 24:56.000]  Hopefully you like 100.
[24:56.000 --> 24:57.000]  We'll get the regs there eventually.
[24:57.000 --> 24:59.000]  But baby steps.
[24:59.000 --> 25:00.000]  And this is what we're doing.
[25:00.000 --> 25:06.000]  You being here, being present, being active as people first will change and move the needle on things.
[25:06.000 --> 25:07.000]  Every single time.
[25:07.000 --> 25:14.000]  And, again, as a musician, then representing that and confusing that in your music and being honest about it when asked and being an advocate in that way.
[25:14.000 --> 25:15.000]  Right?
[25:15.000 --> 25:21.000]  Like that's the one thing in retail I always try to focus on is where I think you guys are going to be so successful is you're not just creating customers.
[25:21.000 --> 25:22.000]  You're creating advocates.
[25:22.000 --> 25:25.000]  And that extends beyond the transaction every single time.
[25:25.000 --> 25:36.000]  And so what your artist and what that creative experience and expression is going to look like for them as they enjoy your products, please dig deeper and deeper, not into the product, but into the people.
[25:36.000 --> 25:42.000]  And you will always win and you're always going to be able to maneuver the regulations that way because the regulations are really fixed on the product.
[25:42.000 --> 25:43.000]  Right?
[25:43.000 --> 25:48.000]  And, again, you have to be careful in terms of characterization and celebrity endorsement and all those other elements that are technical.
[25:48.000 --> 25:51.000]  But the real narratives actually aren't restricted.
[25:52.000 --> 25:54.000]  And you can have voice overlay on plant video all day.
[25:54.000 --> 25:55.000]  Right?
[25:55.000 --> 25:57.000]  Like this is where you've got to be creative.
[25:57.000 --> 25:58.000]  That's a very good point.
[25:58.000 --> 26:05.000]  People have to know how and who and what you do is valuable to them and valuable to you more importantly and they want to resonate with that.
[26:05.000 --> 26:06.000]  Totally.
[26:06.000 --> 26:07.000]  Be authentic in that expression.
[26:07.000 --> 26:08.000]  Totally.
[26:08.000 --> 26:12.000]  If it's at a concert, at the beach, whatever, I'm going to take Loop4 with me because I understand I'm vibing with that.
[26:12.000 --> 26:14.000]  They support artists.
[26:14.000 --> 26:15.000]  I love music.
[26:15.000 --> 26:16.000]  Great strains.
[26:16.000 --> 26:17.000]  Great cultivars.
[26:17.000 --> 26:20.000]  Great expressions of the people that do what they love.
[26:20.000 --> 26:22.000]  That's what I want to see come out of Loop4.
[26:22.000 --> 26:28.000]  That's what retailers and bud tenders and consumers are going to resonate with and that's why they're going to come back and get that fifth purchase.
[26:28.000 --> 26:29.000]  Right?
[26:29.000 --> 26:33.000]  It's the same logic as a band.
[26:33.000 --> 26:34.000]  You know?
[26:34.000 --> 26:39.000]  Like when we play shows now, we're trying to make people buy tickets for the 20th time sometimes.
[26:39.000 --> 26:48.000]  So it's taken years to form a relationship with people where they feel like it's worth buying it for that 20th time and not going and seeing the new thing.
[26:49.000 --> 26:59.000]  You only do that by actually showing love, by actually doing the thing you say you're going to do and showing up every time and fucking giving everything to it.
[26:59.000 --> 27:00.000]  Look what these farmers do.
[27:00.000 --> 27:01.000]  Look at this plant.
[27:01.000 --> 27:07.000]  You know how many hours go into all of that expression, the trimming, the hanging, the drying, the angst that comes if there's any issues?
[27:07.000 --> 27:09.000]  How much they bleed into that product.
[27:09.000 --> 27:16.000]  And then the science and complexity and beauty of technology and infrastructure around the extraction methodologies.
[27:17.000 --> 27:18.000]  It's incredible.
[27:18.000 --> 27:27.000]  It's just the synergy and the people that have evolved through this process, through prohibition and now into legalization, we're getting better and more refined every time.
[27:27.000 --> 27:30.000]  Every challenge comes up, we actually overcome it faster.
[27:30.000 --> 27:34.000]  And you look at alcohol rags, you talk about 80 years and it really developed mainstream.
[27:34.000 --> 27:37.000]  Well, you know, just an expression.
[27:37.000 --> 27:39.000]  No, but look at how fast it continues to change.
[27:39.000 --> 27:40.000]  Even 80 years later.
[27:40.000 --> 27:42.000]  10 years from now, this is all going to be wide open.
[27:42.000 --> 27:44.000]  Like Molson changed the name of their company a few years ago.
[27:44.000 --> 27:45.000]  Think about that.
[27:45.000 --> 27:50.000]  They used to be called Molson Coors Brewing Company and now they're the Molson Coors Beverage Company.
[27:50.000 --> 27:53.000]  People are buying vodka sodas, everything like that now.
[27:53.000 --> 27:55.000]  Like weed consumption is up, alcohol is down.
[27:55.000 --> 27:58.000]  Look at how much it's still changing 80 years later.
[27:58.000 --> 28:01.000]  What are we, three years into legalization?
[28:01.000 --> 28:02.000]  That's what I'm saying.
[28:02.000 --> 28:04.000]  This next five to 10 years are going to be tremendous.
[28:04.000 --> 28:13.000]  Now, what's coming along with that, just because of the kind of undermining of the current last two years of COVID and then just a general kind of economic decline on a lot of industries.
[28:13.000 --> 28:17.000]  Cannabis is really being seen as a huge saving grace in all of that.
[28:17.000 --> 28:21.000]  I mean, we contributed $43.5 billion to GDP since 2018.
[28:21.000 --> 28:24.000]  $15 billion in tax revenue, over $100,000 in jobs.
[28:24.000 --> 28:28.000]  And there's not a lot of other industries that have that kind of flex anymore.
[28:28.000 --> 28:30.000]  Territory, completely wiped out during this pandemic.
[28:30.000 --> 28:31.000]  Are they going to surge back?
[28:31.000 --> 28:35.000]  Yes, but their human infrastructure, their supply chain are under great threat.
[28:35.000 --> 28:39.000]  This is a product, like you said, you want to talk about local, keep it regional.
[28:39.000 --> 28:40.000]  That's what we can do here.
[28:40.000 --> 28:50.000]  And we're beginning to see that freeing up of the supply chain happen in a way that's really going to be unique for you to take advantage of, I think, because you're going to be able to get out to the farm and share that experience and bring people.
[28:50.000 --> 28:52.000]  I've got a dear friend of mine, Jeff, in Sweet Valley.
[28:52.000 --> 28:53.000]  He has a green mountain facility.
[28:53.000 --> 28:58.000]  He has this beautiful plot of land and he wants to host amazing fucking concerts there during the summer.
[28:58.000 --> 29:08.000]  Well, if a facility has a research license, if you were to create a star strain, it's totally, Torque has allowed you to go to the facility and to be able to go there and tour and consume and freely.
[29:09.000 --> 29:10.000]  Exactly.
[29:10.000 --> 29:11.000]  If I must.
[29:11.000 --> 29:12.000]  The obligations are heavy.
[29:12.000 --> 29:14.000]  The answer that we may make.
[29:14.000 --> 29:16.000]  But like, no, but like you can do that, right?
[29:16.000 --> 29:20.000]  Like an interesting way of like even connecting and making that a part of the experience.
[29:20.000 --> 29:24.000]  Like you talked about, like the video with the spoken overlay over it.
[29:24.000 --> 29:34.000]  Like there's little things still that you can do that to help like build that like identity, the community, that like the story, the love behind how the thing came to life.
[29:34.000 --> 29:37.000]  Like people just need to be doing that more as well, man.
[29:37.000 --> 29:38.000]  I don't know.
[29:38.000 --> 29:39.000]  We're opening up again.
[29:39.000 --> 29:40.000]  I feel it.
[29:40.000 --> 29:48.000]  I mean, you know, it's going to be progressive, but it's happening and the enjoyment and realization and appreciation, I think, is enriched and renewed in a lot of way.
[29:48.000 --> 29:55.000]  And, you know, I'm sensing the every time you go to a public event, it's like a special thing that we all share because it was taken away from us.
[29:55.000 --> 29:56.000]  Yeah.
[29:56.000 --> 29:59.000]  And so I think we're going to see a real bonding effect happen.
[30:00.000 --> 30:08.000]  And now that the conference scene is now getting momentum again in the industry, we're going to see that community exchange happen more and more and that mycelium get thicker and thicker.
[30:08.000 --> 30:17.000]  We're going to really exchange nutrients and information and best practices and be better every time and learn from, you know, again, experience.
[30:17.000 --> 30:25.000]  And when you infuse the, you know, different perspectives in the room, you know, you get the outcomes that you can't even imagine.
[30:25.000 --> 30:27.000]  And I look at where music hasn't taken cannabis yet.
[30:27.000 --> 30:30.000]  It's been denied that opportunity now in the legalized market.
[30:30.000 --> 30:34.000]  And where are you guys are going to take it in a people sense, in an experience sense, in a product sense?
[30:34.000 --> 30:35.000]  I'm very excited for it.
[30:35.000 --> 30:38.000]  I'm also just excited for it to be back in general.
[30:38.000 --> 30:39.000]  Yeah.
[30:39.000 --> 30:40.000]  Because that sucked.
[30:40.000 --> 30:41.000]  It did.
[30:41.000 --> 30:42.000]  Totally.
[30:42.000 --> 30:43.000]  Sorry.
[30:43.000 --> 30:49.000]  Like that really, really sucked not having like, like I felt like music brings people together so much, man.
[30:49.000 --> 30:50.000]  We have been so disconnected.
[30:50.000 --> 30:54.000]  Like your show at the Phoenix was one of the few that I've been to since it happened.
[30:54.000 --> 30:58.000]  It was just nice to, oh my God, people were all together.
[30:58.000 --> 31:01.000]  And like, you know, like it was 2019.
[31:01.000 --> 31:04.000]  I can't believe we have to reminisce about 2019, by the way.
[31:04.000 --> 31:09.000]  But like my point being is just, it's like, I just, I'm so glad that that is happening again.
[31:09.000 --> 31:10.000]  Yeah.
[31:10.000 --> 31:11.000]  Like shows are being announced.
[31:11.000 --> 31:14.000]  Like that's something that you didn't see for a year and a half.
[31:14.000 --> 31:17.000]  And all of a sudden it's like, whoa, concerts, they're back.
[31:17.000 --> 31:18.000]  Anyway, yeah.
[31:18.000 --> 31:19.000]  I got a question for you.
[31:19.000 --> 31:27.000]  One thing I actually don't have a perspective on yet with Loot Pool is how are the growers reacting to the potentiality of working with artists?
[31:27.000 --> 31:32.000]  I always have the perspective of the artist getting really excited, digging in the garden, learn about how the plants made and like all that.
[31:32.000 --> 31:33.000]  Like, yeah.
[31:33.000 --> 31:34.000]  How are the growers been receiving it?
[31:34.000 --> 31:39.000]  Because, you know, I know you're very careful in your sourcing and, you know, this is a journey you've come to BC on, right?
[31:39.000 --> 31:40.000]  Yeah.
[31:40.000 --> 31:45.000]  You know, really meeting the craft community, talking about your model, how it can activate and empower and enrich a new generation.
[31:45.000 --> 31:48.000]  And so tell me a little bit about what the growers are saying.
[31:48.000 --> 31:58.000]  So, I mean, like with the growers, when people are looking at it, so like originally with a growers going to look at a new company that goes, I'd like to buy, I'd like to buy some flower.
[31:58.000 --> 32:02.000]  What they're going to really look at is to go, how much are you going to move?
[32:02.000 --> 32:04.000]  But also, do they believe in you?
[32:04.000 --> 32:06.000]  Right. Like, like, how are you different than anything else?
[32:06.000 --> 32:08.000]  Or do they really believe in you?
[32:08.000 --> 32:15.000]  And so I think even when they saw this and they sort of saw like understanding it's support created, like it's just a different thing.
[32:15.000 --> 32:17.000]  They saw that it was unique.
[32:17.000 --> 32:29.000]  It really did help us open up conversations and really help us like build on relationships with some of these guys who believe in us to go like, okay, I'm willing to do this because I think this is going to be a long term thing.
[32:29.000 --> 32:38.000]  And what's been exciting about it is it's like, I don't know, like, like, I think for a lot of people, I maybe this is just my peer guess.
[32:38.000 --> 32:41.000]  I think there's a lot of people who've been burned by somebody buying something one off.
[32:41.000 --> 32:43.000]  And then that was it.
[32:43.000 --> 32:47.000]  Because like you came, you sort of threw your shit at the wall, you saw if it tried to stick or not, and it didn't.
[32:47.000 --> 32:50.000]  So I think there's just a lot of skepticism right now.
[32:50.000 --> 32:59.000]  And people, I think, really just want to have confidence that they're going to like get the repeat sales, let alone that it's a partner who they think like it's worth growing with.
[32:59.000 --> 33:07.000]  Because we'll say, okay, so like what we have with one of our like our companies, the Animal Cookies is Dunsberry Farm out of British Columbia here.
[33:07.000 --> 33:09.000]  And it's an incredible strain.
[33:09.000 --> 33:14.000]  And like, now we're talking with them about how we can be able to do, you know, additional strains and additional products with them.
[33:14.000 --> 33:17.000]  Because it's been a hit for us.
[33:17.000 --> 33:20.000]  Like, we've had a great relationship working with the people there.
[33:20.000 --> 33:23.000]  And they see the brand clicking and working.
[33:23.000 --> 33:25.000]  It's like, oh, okay, well, we have some new things coming.
[33:25.000 --> 33:32.000]  That's the really, really cool thing to be building is it's like they're seeing it like this is three months old.
[33:32.000 --> 33:35.000]  This is three months old, you know.
[33:35.000 --> 33:38.000]  But like to be still building that kind of rapport with people.
[33:38.000 --> 33:40.000]  That's really cool.
[33:40.000 --> 33:49.000]  And I think what will be really, really cool is like if they want to help put their places on the map, when we can talk about doing these new like artist co-branded limited editions, they can come and see the thing.
[33:49.000 --> 33:50.000]  Yeah, drops.
[33:50.000 --> 33:56.000]  I'm excited about that too with the album release with with the concert tour with the visit in town.
[33:56.000 --> 34:03.000]  I think there's an accelerated traction of commercial potential here that has yet to be harnessed and enjoyed and invested in further.
[34:04.000 --> 34:06.000]  And it's badly needed by the music industry, right?
[34:06.000 --> 34:07.000]  Yeah, it is.
[34:07.000 --> 34:09.000]  We need each other.
[34:09.000 --> 34:12.000]  You know, you need our ubiquity.
[34:12.000 --> 34:16.000]  You need our ability to reach the audience that you guys are trying to reach.
[34:16.000 --> 34:18.000]  And we need the capital.
[34:18.000 --> 34:19.000]  We need the hype.
[34:19.000 --> 34:25.000]  We need the fucking we need to like I'd stick loop pool on the side of our bus.
[34:25.000 --> 34:26.000]  You know what I mean?
[34:26.000 --> 34:28.000]  Because it's a big fucking bus.
[34:28.000 --> 34:30.000]  And that is space.
[34:30.000 --> 34:34.000]  I just you know, we three years ago was last time we toured in a bus.
[34:34.000 --> 34:43.000]  The price we just got a quote for a bus for 11 days for $41,000 before you get a driver or pay gasoline.
[34:43.000 --> 34:45.000]  And that used to be $12,000.
[34:45.000 --> 34:49.000]  Like everything in the music industry is triple what it used to be.
[34:49.000 --> 34:55.000]  Backline rentals, buses, venues and all the guarantees are lower.
[34:55.000 --> 34:56.000]  Forty one thousand.
[34:56.000 --> 34:59.000]  So the economics of music right now are punishing.
[34:59.000 --> 35:01.000]  And we need partners.
[35:01.000 --> 35:08.000]  We need people who are like who have a mutually beneficial relationship with us where we can both hype our shit.
[35:08.000 --> 35:12.000]  Because there's so much noise in the world too.
[35:12.000 --> 35:22.000]  You know, there's just so much fucking noise in every sphere that the more you can band together with people with the same values and the same core audience.
[35:22.000 --> 35:27.000]  The more deep your message is going to permeate.
[35:27.000 --> 35:29.000]  Give us the fair chance to get that message out there.
[35:29.000 --> 35:31.000]  Let us be like gambling.
[35:31.000 --> 35:32.000]  Yeah.
[35:32.000 --> 35:34.000]  Well, it can totally ruin people's lives.
[35:34.000 --> 35:36.000]  But for some reason you can advertise that.
[35:36.000 --> 35:44.000]  And the greatest benefit you have as a musician and what we have as an industry is that we have a product that fundamentally transforms the individual who consumes it.
[35:44.000 --> 35:46.000]  Fundamentally.
[35:46.000 --> 35:48.000]  Music fundamentally transforms me.
[35:48.000 --> 35:51.000]  Cannabis when I consume it fundamentally transforms me.
[35:51.000 --> 35:54.000]  It's a cascading effect across my systems.
[35:54.000 --> 36:03.000]  And it's just one of the most powerful things you can experience is someone who averted a very debilitating pharmaceutical drug regimen to turn to a much more benign and beneficial option.
[36:03.000 --> 36:06.000]  And music does that for me too.
[36:06.000 --> 36:07.000]  Right.
[36:07.000 --> 36:08.000]  It's another medicine of my soul.
[36:08.000 --> 36:09.000]  Absolutely.
[36:09.000 --> 36:10.000]  I'm grateful for that time.
[36:10.000 --> 36:11.000]  And you've been creating recently.
[36:11.000 --> 36:12.000]  You have a new album.
[36:12.000 --> 36:13.000]  Got a new record coming out.
[36:13.000 --> 36:15.000]  I'm very, very interested to hear about it.
[36:15.000 --> 36:16.000]  What's going on there?
[36:16.000 --> 36:17.000]  Oh, God.
[36:17.000 --> 36:20.000]  You know, it's us doing it so long.
[36:20.000 --> 36:22.000]  We just try to keep writing the perfect hook.
[36:22.000 --> 36:25.000]  And the last album was 2017.
[36:25.000 --> 36:27.000]  So this was a four year.
[36:27.000 --> 36:29.000]  In between we did this crazy play.
[36:29.000 --> 36:30.000]  We did a play.
[36:30.000 --> 36:31.000]  What?
[36:31.000 --> 36:32.000]  Yeah.
[36:32.000 --> 36:34.000]  We all did a play about ourselves starring us.
[36:34.000 --> 36:36.000]  It was really fucking weird.
[36:36.000 --> 36:40.000]  My friend Chris Abraham has this theater company in Toronto and we did.
[36:40.000 --> 36:45.000]  We built a show where we rebuilt our rehearsal space on stage.
[36:45.000 --> 36:46.000]  Oh, wow.
[36:46.000 --> 36:49.000]  Like an exact replica of our jam space.
[36:49.000 --> 36:53.000]  And we told the story of our lives together in a play form.
[36:53.000 --> 36:55.000]  And all the dudes in the band acted in it.
[36:55.000 --> 36:56.000]  They've never acted before.
[36:56.000 --> 36:57.000]  I come from an acting background.
[36:57.000 --> 36:58.000]  That's tremendous.
[36:58.000 --> 36:59.000]  They had never done it before.
[36:59.000 --> 37:02.000]  And we did it for like a month in Toronto and it was amazing.
[37:02.000 --> 37:07.000]  So that took like a year and a half to do, to figure out how to do.
[37:07.000 --> 37:11.000]  But yeah, we're just happy still to be here.
[37:11.000 --> 37:14.000]  And we've got shows coming up.
[37:14.000 --> 37:15.000]  What's the vibe for the record?
[37:16.000 --> 37:21.000]  It's very, what's the vibe?
[37:21.000 --> 37:24.000]  Well, we worked with Jace Lacek, who's in Besnard Lakes,
[37:24.000 --> 37:26.000]  who we worked with.
[37:26.000 --> 37:28.000]  He's a Montreal OG.
[37:28.000 --> 37:31.000]  He has this incredible studio called Break Glass where a lot of records
[37:31.000 --> 37:34.000]  that a lot of people love have been made.
[37:34.000 --> 37:36.000]  And he's a dear old friend.
[37:36.000 --> 37:38.000]  And he's a brilliant guy.
[37:38.000 --> 37:40.000]  He's got brilliant analog gear.
[37:40.000 --> 37:42.000]  And he's the same generation as us.
[37:42.000 --> 37:44.000]  I think there's a lot of,
[37:44.000 --> 37:48.000]  I think it sort of sounds like 90s Morrissey without the racism.
[37:48.000 --> 37:50.000]  Okay.
[37:50.000 --> 37:52.000]  It's big.
[37:52.000 --> 37:53.000]  It's lush.
[37:53.000 --> 37:56.000]  It's got lots of horns on it.
[37:56.000 --> 38:00.000]  It's about memory.
[38:00.000 --> 38:02.000]  It's about losing things.
[38:02.000 --> 38:04.000]  It's stars.
[38:04.000 --> 38:08.000]  It sounds, it's so hard to describe what you do.
[38:09.000 --> 38:10.000]  We're in line with cannabis here.
[38:10.000 --> 38:12.000]  Losing things, memories.
[38:12.000 --> 38:13.000]  Yeah, exactly.
[38:13.000 --> 38:15.000]  We try to write soundtracks for people's lives.
[38:15.000 --> 38:17.000]  We want songs that last.
[38:17.000 --> 38:19.000]  You guys have done some of the best ones ever, man.
[38:19.000 --> 38:20.000]  Thanks, man.
[38:20.000 --> 38:22.000]  Appreciate it.
[38:22.000 --> 38:24.000]  So we're just happy we're still doing it.
[38:24.000 --> 38:26.000]  We love each other a lot.
[38:26.000 --> 38:28.000]  It's not as easy as it used to be,
[38:28.000 --> 38:32.000]  but we can't imagine not being together and doing it.
[38:32.000 --> 38:33.000]  Well, that creative experience.
[38:33.000 --> 38:34.000]  Exactly.
[38:34.000 --> 38:36.000]  The creative side of it.
[38:36.000 --> 38:40.000]  Again, that journey on stage must have been just tremendous to run that show
[38:40.000 --> 38:41.000]  night after night.
[38:41.000 --> 38:42.000]  I can't imagine the energy.
[38:42.000 --> 38:44.000]  Everyone should do the play of their life.
[38:44.000 --> 38:45.000]  Good call.
[38:45.000 --> 38:49.000]  Because once you act yourself at your worst,
[38:49.000 --> 38:52.000]  it's like stepping outside of yourself and you're like,
[38:52.000 --> 38:55.000]  well, now I can't do it in real life.
[38:55.000 --> 38:59.000]  Because look, I'm doing it on stage and people are laughing at how insane I am.
[38:59.000 --> 39:03.000]  So now in real life, I have to behave like this.
[39:03.000 --> 39:04.000]  Look, I have to go.
[39:04.000 --> 39:05.000]  We have to pick up our kids.
[39:05.000 --> 39:06.000]  No doubt.
[39:06.000 --> 39:07.000]  Thank you for stopping by.
[39:07.000 --> 39:09.000]  Oh, dude, I wish I could stay.
[39:09.000 --> 39:10.000]  Tor Campbell.
[39:10.000 --> 39:12.000]  Is Luke Wall the name of the band?
[39:12.000 --> 39:14.000]  No, Luke Wall is the name of our company.
[39:14.000 --> 39:15.000]  What's the name of the band?
[39:15.000 --> 39:16.000]  Stars.
[39:16.000 --> 39:17.000]  Stars.
[39:17.000 --> 39:19.000]  Stars is the name of the band.
[39:19.000 --> 39:22.000]  The name of the band is Stars.
[39:22.000 --> 39:23.000]  From Montreal.
[39:23.000 --> 39:25.000]  Do I know Genevieve?
[39:25.000 --> 39:28.000]  Do I know Genevieve?
[39:28.000 --> 39:31.400]  Jenny Walker?
[39:31.400 --> 39:33.400]  Come on, man.
[39:33.400 --> 39:35.400]  That's my homegirl.
[39:36.400 --> 39:38.400]  Oh, my God.
[39:38.400 --> 39:39.400]  That's crazy.
[39:39.400 --> 39:41.400]  And Ganja family.
[39:41.400 --> 39:45.400]  We're talking about Genevieve Walker, who's one of the world's most beautiful and amazing humans.
[39:45.400 --> 39:48.400]  And she played in Stars for a while with us.
[39:48.400 --> 39:49.400]  But I grew up with Jenny.
[39:49.400 --> 39:51.400]  I've known her since we were like 11 years old.
[39:51.400 --> 39:52.400]  That's so beautiful.
[39:52.400 --> 39:53.400]  Yeah.
[39:53.400 --> 39:54.400]  And Renee.
[39:54.400 --> 39:55.400]  Renee Bisbee is another friend.
[39:55.400 --> 39:56.400]  Incredible people.
[39:56.400 --> 40:01.400]  And like Jenny's sister, Kathy, I went to high school, all through high school with her.
[40:01.400 --> 40:02.400]  So, yeah.
[40:02.400 --> 40:03.400]  That's sweet.
[40:03.400 --> 40:04.400]  Yeah, man.
[40:04.400 --> 40:05.400]  That's so nice that you bring her name up.
[40:05.400 --> 40:06.400]  I love that lady so much.
[40:06.400 --> 40:07.400]  Give thanks.
[40:07.400 --> 40:08.400]  Give thanks.
[40:08.400 --> 40:09.400]  Yeah.
[40:09.400 --> 40:10.400]  All right, my man.
[40:10.400 --> 40:11.400]  I got to run.
[40:11.400 --> 40:12.400]  Love it.
[40:12.400 --> 40:13.400]  Thank you so much, brother.
[40:13.400 --> 40:14.400]  That was a real pleasure.
[40:14.400 --> 40:15.400]  Thank you so much for having us.
[40:15.400 --> 40:16.400]  It was really lovely.
[40:16.400 --> 40:17.400]  Josh, great to meet you, brother.
[40:17.400 --> 40:18.400]  Take care of yourself.
[40:18.400 --> 40:19.400]  We'll catch up.
[40:19.400 --> 40:20.400]  I hope I see you soon.
[40:20.400 --> 40:21.400]  Take care, Drake.
[40:21.400 --> 40:22.400]  Thanks, man.
[40:22.400 --> 40:23.400]  Hello, Cleveland.
[40:23.400 --> 40:36.680]  All right.
[40:36.680 --> 40:37.680]  Thank Josh.
[40:37.680 --> 40:38.680]  Josh may take over that mic.
[40:38.680 --> 40:39.680]  Josh, you're on.
[40:39.680 --> 40:42.270]  Josh, you're on.
[40:42.270 --> 40:43.270]  Josh, you're on.
[40:43.270 --> 40:44.270]  Josh, you're on.
[40:44.270 --> 40:45.270]  Josh, you're on.
[40:45.270 --> 40:46.270]  Josh, you're on.
[40:46.270 --> 40:47.270]  Josh, you're on.
[40:47.270 --> 40:48.270]  Josh, you're on.
[40:48.270 --> 40:49.270]  Josh, you're on.
[40:49.270 --> 40:53.460]  Josh, you're on.
[40:53.460 --> 40:54.460]  All right, I'm going to take over that mic.
[40:54.460 --> 40:55.460]  Josh, you're on.
[40:55.460 --> 40:56.460]  Josh, you're on.
[40:56.460 --> 40:58.960]  I want to hear from the guy who's been rolling joints a thing, my connection.
[40:58.960 --> 41:10.080]  Yeah, he's just been sitting there rolling and rolling and rolling, just rolling away.
[41:10.080 --> 41:12.500]  What is he rolling?
[41:12.500 --> 41:13.500]  I would like to know.
[41:13.500 --> 41:16.080]  Yeah, no, I don't want that guy to leave.
[41:16.080 --> 41:17.760]  I want to hear from him.
[41:17.760 --> 41:20.900]  He's been rolling joints the entire conversation.
[41:20.900 --> 41:32.880]  Well, at least now we know the name of the band is Stars.
[41:32.880 --> 41:33.880]  I know.
[41:33.880 --> 41:38.560]  Did you see how many times I asked London to like get the name of the band?
[41:38.560 --> 41:40.440]  I sure did.
[41:40.440 --> 41:43.600]  Can you get the...
[41:43.600 --> 41:44.600]  What about comedians?
[41:44.600 --> 41:46.240]  You think comedians would be...
[41:46.240 --> 41:47.240]  Oh, 100%.
[41:47.240 --> 41:52.640]  No, I've been trying to do stuff here in LA with comedians, and I want to do a ton of
[41:52.640 --> 41:53.640]  stuff with comedians.
[41:53.640 --> 41:58.400]  Oh, that would be a blast.
[41:58.400 --> 42:00.800]  I always wanted to do comedy.
[42:00.800 --> 42:07.600]  It's just that I never really wanted to be famous.
[42:07.600 --> 42:15.400]  Like I never wanted to trade my anonymity for fame.
[42:15.960 --> 42:23.040]  Well, Chris, you could practice your comedy routines on the FCP audience.
[42:23.040 --> 42:24.040]  That's what I always do.
[42:24.040 --> 42:25.040]  And on the squirrel.
[42:25.040 --> 42:28.520]  Yeah, you can.
[42:28.520 --> 42:34.400]  The squirrel seems like he's a very receptive audience, lying in one position.
[42:34.400 --> 42:37.480]  I just listen to you all day.
[42:37.480 --> 42:38.480]  He just looks at me.
[42:38.480 --> 42:41.080]  So you were wondering what we were smoking.
[42:41.080 --> 42:45.240]  And we were listening to these guys over here and they were just talking about how they
[42:45.360 --> 42:54.800]  care for their units and trying to keep them clean so they can actually taste.
[42:54.800 --> 42:55.800]  Basically don't Chaz the Banger.
[42:55.800 --> 42:56.800]  Don't Chaz the Banger.
[42:56.800 --> 42:57.800]  You know what I mean?
[42:57.800 --> 42:58.800]  I have a friend named Chaz.
[42:58.800 --> 42:59.800]  I don't know if he would appreciate that.
[42:59.800 --> 43:05.800]  Well, if Chaz has a banger, then he can Chaz a banger.
[43:05.800 --> 43:06.800]  That's different.
[43:06.800 --> 43:08.800]  He should have a couple bangers here and there.
[43:08.800 --> 43:10.800]  So what are you guys smoking up?
[43:10.800 --> 43:11.800]  Well...
[43:11.800 --> 43:12.800]  Go ahead.
[43:12.800 --> 43:13.800]  I did just jump in right before you both did.
[43:14.360 --> 43:15.360]  Dude.
[43:15.360 --> 43:16.360]  Into the mic.
[43:16.360 --> 43:17.360]  Oh, and you're off.
[43:17.360 --> 43:18.360]  So, okay.
[43:18.360 --> 43:19.360]  So Drake, what's the deal with the watermelon Astro Boy?
[43:19.360 --> 43:25.880]  Because sometimes people are like, oh God, I'm seeing a ton of watermelon Astro Boy all
[43:25.880 --> 43:26.880]  over the place.
[43:26.880 --> 43:28.120]  Where does it come from?
[43:28.120 --> 43:30.320]  Is it like a sweet strain?
[43:30.320 --> 43:31.320]  What's up?
[43:31.320 --> 43:33.960]  So the profile on it is definitely a little sweet, which is neat.
[43:33.960 --> 43:38.240]  I don't get a ton of watermelon, but I kind of get that perfume-y, rind kind of vibe going.
[43:38.240 --> 43:40.520]  So if you imagine a little bit, it comes there.
[43:40.520 --> 43:45.040]  I'm not super familiar, even though I was just hearing a story on where it was coming
[43:45.040 --> 43:47.240]  from and a couple of people, I think...
[43:47.240 --> 43:48.240]  Is it a Canadian?
[43:48.240 --> 43:49.240]  Spread it out.
[43:49.240 --> 43:50.240]  I don't know.
[43:50.240 --> 43:54.880]  I've probably got about as much knowledge as yourself on it, but I think we've got a
[43:54.880 --> 43:56.440]  couple of people around here that are more familiar.
[43:56.440 --> 43:57.440]  Sweet.
[43:57.440 --> 43:58.440]  Yeah.
[43:58.440 --> 44:01.120]  Lots of cups have been passed out in the last while and it's a pretty solid hasher.
[44:01.120 --> 44:04.720]  So of course, with the way things are going, you're going to see that coming around a lot
[44:04.720 --> 44:05.720]  more.
[44:05.720 --> 44:06.720]  Oh, yeah.
[44:06.720 --> 44:09.060]  There we go.
[44:10.060 --> 44:13.060]  You got your glue.
[44:13.060 --> 44:14.060]  Is that a glue?
[44:14.060 --> 44:19.060]  Yeah, there's the glukis that's holding up the ice over here, and the Wagyu and the gelato.
[44:19.060 --> 44:20.060]  The gelato.
[44:20.060 --> 44:22.060]  You know, this gelato is super dark.
[44:22.060 --> 44:25.060]  I mean, not in a dark batter.
[44:25.060 --> 44:26.060]  Can you tell me a little bit about Wagyu?
[44:26.060 --> 44:27.060]  So these are all from Van Gyption.
[44:27.060 --> 44:28.060]  Van Gyption.
[44:28.060 --> 44:29.060]  Yes.
[44:29.060 --> 44:30.060]  Awesome.
[44:30.060 --> 44:31.060]  A good buddy of mine, Trees, my stroke hand, he did a...
[44:31.060 --> 44:34.060]  You guys were on Fire is Fire, right?
[44:34.060 --> 44:35.060]  Tell people about who...
[44:35.060 --> 44:36.060]  You were on Fire is Fire, right?
[44:36.060 --> 44:37.060]  Yes.
[44:37.060 --> 44:42.060]  Tell people like in the US or other people around who Van Gyption, like what's the deal
[44:42.060 --> 44:43.060]  with Van Gyption?
[44:43.060 --> 44:47.060]  Again, just they're out of the coast, out of Vancouver around here doing a ton of processing.
[44:47.060 --> 44:51.060]  Definitely been in the industry for quite a minute now.
[44:51.060 --> 44:56.060]  Lots of solventless hash production, air dried traditional, some very solid product.
[44:56.060 --> 45:01.060]  I haven't had a crazy amount of them in the past, but from everything that I've tried,
[45:01.060 --> 45:03.060]  it's been right top notch.
[45:03.060 --> 45:04.060]  Sweet.
[45:04.060 --> 45:11.060]  Wagyu is rich, meaty, beefy.
[45:11.060 --> 45:13.060]  It was quite shocking to me.
[45:13.060 --> 45:14.060]  Got a funk, eh?
[45:14.060 --> 45:15.060]  Like that lockery, yeah.
[45:15.060 --> 45:17.060]  It really kicked it in.
[45:17.060 --> 45:18.060]  Pungent.
[45:18.060 --> 45:19.060]  Quite interesting.
[45:19.060 --> 45:25.060]  With the name Wagyu, I totally expected it to go that direction because it should, but
[45:25.060 --> 45:28.060]  it's a little shocking when you go through all these flavors and all these regular things
[45:28.060 --> 45:32.060]  that you see all the time and then you get something that's just out of the box.
[45:32.060 --> 45:33.060]  It's so refreshing.
[45:33.060 --> 45:35.060]  It's just like gives you that pull back.
[45:35.060 --> 45:36.060]  It's like really nice.
[45:36.060 --> 45:40.060]  I almost like to pass that one on without saying what the name is, just to get people's
[45:40.060 --> 45:41.060]  true perspective on it.
[45:41.060 --> 45:42.060]  It always comes off really interesting.
[45:42.060 --> 45:45.060]  Josh had a neat way of describing it a little bit earlier, which was great.
[45:45.060 --> 45:47.060]  But yeah, what do you look?
[45:47.060 --> 45:48.060]  Oh my goodness.
[45:48.060 --> 45:51.060]  You can all see, I don't know, Josh just pulled out the gauntlet here.
[45:51.060 --> 45:53.060]  Oh yeah, well let's see.
[45:53.060 --> 45:59.060]  We got this delightful little blend that we brought from our homestead, from the Dragonfly Farm.
[45:59.060 --> 46:00.060]  Yes.
[46:00.060 --> 46:03.060]  So we've got, well we've got a...
[46:03.060 --> 46:05.060]  And Marcus, is Marcus washing?
[46:05.060 --> 46:09.060]  Are you doing the washing for this or do you guys do it?
[46:09.060 --> 46:10.060]  No.
[46:10.060 --> 46:11.060]  You guys do it.
[46:11.060 --> 46:12.060]  I've watched this, but I've maybe given some tips.
[46:12.060 --> 46:13.060]  Yeah.
[46:13.060 --> 46:14.060]  Marcus is helpful.
[46:14.060 --> 46:15.060]  Just one or two.
[46:15.060 --> 46:16.060]  He's my brethren.
[46:16.060 --> 46:19.060]  He's an important person in our life.
[46:19.060 --> 46:24.060]  If I have any questions, definitely I can hit up Marcus and I appreciate that with the
[46:24.060 --> 46:28.060]  family members around and the peer certified group as well.
[46:28.060 --> 46:31.060]  Because we've never had any BHO part of our certification.
[46:31.060 --> 46:38.060]  So it's always been solventless, like killer hash makers and like make your own nutrients,
[46:38.060 --> 46:40.060]  soil grown style.
[46:40.060 --> 46:41.060]  Right.
[46:41.060 --> 46:45.060]  Can you tell, like, I'd love to know a little bit, because you guys are in Oregon as well.
[46:45.060 --> 46:50.060]  Can you like, what's the perspective like from somebody coming from the American market
[46:50.060 --> 46:54.060]  into the Canadian market and looking at it from that perspective that you guys have?
[46:54.060 --> 46:56.060]  Because it's a little bit unique for sure.
[46:57.060 --> 47:00.060]  I guess from our perspective, we've just been up here for a long time.
[47:00.060 --> 47:05.060]  So it's more life integrated rather than just like showing up from Oregon right now and
[47:05.060 --> 47:08.060]  just being like, whoa, wow, this is what's going on around here.
[47:08.060 --> 47:14.060]  You know, like we sort of feel like we discovered this zone, which not this zone because we're
[47:14.060 --> 47:19.060]  in the Okanagan, but the Kootenays over by Nelson, which is more mountainous inland,
[47:19.060 --> 47:22.060]  British Columbia and wild in the mountains type thing.
[47:22.060 --> 47:24.060]  Homestead.
[47:24.060 --> 47:27.060]  Yeah, I've got a friend that lived out there that just moved back.
[47:27.060 --> 47:28.060]  You've been to the Kootenays.
[47:28.060 --> 47:30.060]  Yeah, I've been debating it.
[47:30.060 --> 47:32.060]  It's just a sweet spot.
[47:32.060 --> 47:33.060]  It's far away.
[47:33.060 --> 47:34.060]  It's far away.
[47:34.060 --> 47:37.060]  And you've got to rely on yourself for creativity.
[47:37.060 --> 47:38.060]  You would do really well.
[47:38.060 --> 47:40.060]  I mean, look at the amazing seed stuff you're making.
[47:40.060 --> 47:42.060]  Yeah, I've had a lot of fun doing it.
[47:42.060 --> 47:45.060]  Along with, I'm sure I know other amazing things.
[47:45.060 --> 47:46.060]  Your family is so beautiful.
[47:46.060 --> 47:53.060]  So I'm getting lucky and stoked to get to know your family better, which is off subject.
[47:53.060 --> 47:54.060]  But you have a nice family.
[47:54.060 --> 47:56.060]  Well, that's the great thing about the conversation.
[47:56.060 --> 48:02.060]  And I think it's critical because people like they glaze over like stuff behind the scenes.
[48:02.060 --> 48:05.060]  Like everybody knows Marcus and everybody asks Marcus about his hash.
[48:05.060 --> 48:07.060]  But like, how's Marcus?
[48:07.060 --> 48:10.060]  What did he do last week that was different or something like that?
[48:10.060 --> 48:11.060]  You know what I mean?
[48:11.060 --> 48:12.060]  Like I want to hear about your family.
[48:12.060 --> 48:13.060]  And I think other people do too.
[48:13.060 --> 48:15.060]  They don't want to just hear about your hash.
[48:15.060 --> 48:18.060]  Yeah, no, it's a personal connection that we've made.
[48:18.060 --> 48:22.060]  That's why these events are important because we're connecting.
[48:22.060 --> 48:23.060]  Yeah.
[48:23.060 --> 48:25.060]  You know, we're hanging out heart to heart, like puff to puff.
[48:25.060 --> 48:28.060]  You know, we're enjoying ourselves, you know.
[48:28.060 --> 48:30.060]  Bless up Jameson over here.
[48:30.060 --> 48:32.060]  Marcus, the family.
[48:32.060 --> 48:33.060]  I mean, it's been sweet.
[48:33.060 --> 48:38.060]  You know, it's been a nice and we haven't done this like everyone knows, you know, for a while.
[48:38.060 --> 48:40.060]  So it's sweet.
[48:40.060 --> 48:50.060]  But as far as our perspective, our perspective is West Coast, you know, global, you know.
[48:50.060 --> 48:52.060]  So, yeah, we do have a perspective of both things.
[48:52.060 --> 48:54.060]  This.
[48:54.060 --> 48:59.060]  And Marcus, everyone knows it's like.
[48:59.060 --> 49:09.060]  It's disassociated from the actual roots of it, you know, like when you get into like actual legalization and Canadian legalization, I mean, it's disassociated from like the roots.
[49:09.060 --> 49:14.060]  And these brands and these people are awesome and it's great.
[49:14.060 --> 49:16.060]  Anyone can create a brand.
[49:17.060 --> 49:20.060]  It just doesn't represent like the roots of the movement.
[49:20.060 --> 49:36.060]  Say us or something like all these families, you know, Gary, who's here and stuff like Drake and people who grew up in the areas like we or those type of people didn't have a chance to express themselves in this market.
[49:36.060 --> 49:41.060]  So we've stayed medical or we've entered in different ways.
[49:41.060 --> 49:50.060]  Some awesome family members who are here have done like micros and even Rosebud with Che and people can check out Rosebud online.
[49:50.060 --> 49:53.060]  That's one of the LPs in the Kootenays.
[49:53.060 --> 49:55.060]  The only one really?
[49:55.060 --> 49:56.060]  Yeah.
[49:56.060 --> 49:57.060]  Fair enough, right?
[49:57.060 --> 49:59.060]  Like it's one of the only LPs in the Kootenays.
[49:59.060 --> 50:00.060]  Like really?
[50:00.060 --> 50:01.060]  There's one?
[50:01.060 --> 50:02.060]  LP in the Kootenays.
[50:02.060 --> 50:04.060]  There's one licensed.
[50:04.060 --> 50:08.060]  And to be a licensed producer means you can sell weed to the market.
[50:08.060 --> 50:09.060]  Yeah.
[50:09.060 --> 50:12.060]  Like a micro producer can't sell weed to anyone.
[50:12.060 --> 50:15.060]  Like a micro producer has to work with a licensed producer.
[50:15.060 --> 50:20.060]  In most cases, the licensed producers are not like family member homies.
[50:20.060 --> 50:23.060]  Like they're probably more businessman.
[50:23.060 --> 50:26.060]  They can be family and awesome and homies and stuff.
[50:26.060 --> 50:27.060]  It's just more business.
[50:27.060 --> 50:28.060]  It's just more business.
[50:28.060 --> 50:29.060]  But it's not great.
[50:29.060 --> 50:34.060]  And it's usually there's a lack of understanding and a disconnect there.
[50:35.060 --> 50:37.060]  There's a deeper meaning to what we're trying to do.
[50:37.060 --> 50:43.060]  And that's why advocates like yourself have moved the industry and space forward
[50:43.060 --> 50:46.060]  and pushed to do it because we respect it.
[50:46.060 --> 50:47.060]  We understood the culture.
[50:47.060 --> 50:48.060]  We were part of it.
[50:48.060 --> 50:50.060]  And even like I'll shit on it a little bit.
[50:50.060 --> 50:54.060]  But I find the way Canada did it, I almost felt like it was rushed
[50:54.060 --> 50:56.060]  and in a way to purposely kind of.
[50:56.060 --> 50:57.060]  It was to do that.
[50:57.060 --> 50:58.060]  Deliberately.
[50:58.060 --> 51:00.060]  Decentralized like or whatever.
[51:00.060 --> 51:02.060]  Like more centralized probably.
[51:02.060 --> 51:03.060]  Approach.
[51:03.060 --> 51:04.060]  Yeah.
[51:04.060 --> 51:05.060]  Exactly.
[51:07.060 --> 51:08.060]  Yeah.
[51:08.060 --> 51:10.060]  No, it was it was an organized.
[51:19.060 --> 51:21.060]  I'm just saying that I disagree.
[51:21.060 --> 51:25.060]  I don't think that it's a something that was done quickly or without thought.
[51:25.060 --> 51:28.060]  I don't think the thought might have been right or the thought leaders that are
[51:28.060 --> 51:31.060]  are are the right ones doing it.
[51:31.060 --> 51:34.060]  My comment is, is that cannabis has been legalized in Canada medically since
[51:34.060 --> 51:42.060]  2001 and we've seen a progression since from 2001 onward of legalization
[51:42.060 --> 51:44.060]  or access widening.
[51:44.060 --> 51:48.060]  And though it took longer being the first G7 country to do so.
[51:48.060 --> 51:49.060]  It's been a long time.
[51:49.060 --> 51:52.060]  It was a long time coming for for recreational legalization.
[51:52.060 --> 51:56.060]  And I believe Canada did it was did it the right way.
[51:56.060 --> 52:00.060]  Looking at other countries that legalize recreationally and then or trying
[52:00.060 --> 52:04.060]  to recreational and medical at the same time or try and put a rec system in
[52:04.060 --> 52:06.060]  and then put a medical system in.
[52:06.060 --> 52:09.060]  I think that there were problems and balls dropped during legalization,
[52:09.060 --> 52:10.060]  of course.
[52:10.060 --> 52:13.060]  And I think that a lot of the laws that were applied to cannabis were just
[52:13.060 --> 52:15.060]  cut and paste out of the tobacco regulations.
[52:15.060 --> 52:17.060]  And I don't think that that was right.
[52:17.060 --> 52:21.060]  I think that people who are sitting at this table specifically, you know,
[52:21.060 --> 52:24.060]  Marcus, Josh, Kelly, people like that should have been.
[52:24.060 --> 52:28.060]  If you're going to steal regulation from another industry and not incorporate.
[52:28.060 --> 52:31.060]  If you're going to steal the regulation from another industry and not involve it
[52:31.060 --> 52:33.060]  in you, you're rushing your work.
[52:33.060 --> 52:35.060]  You're not doing your proper due diligence.
[52:35.060 --> 52:39.060]  And it's just oversight or it's just the wrong people making those decisions.
[52:39.060 --> 52:40.060]  And it's not rushed work.
[52:40.060 --> 52:41.060]  It's not rushed work.
[52:41.060 --> 52:45.060]  It's it's well, it's thought out work by people who thought that they were
[52:45.060 --> 52:48.060]  doing the right thing, but they they were just imposters.
[52:48.060 --> 52:50.060]  They thought that they were they were here for.
[52:50.060 --> 52:52.060]  They said, we're cannabis people.
[52:52.060 --> 52:53.060]  We understand the system.
[52:53.060 --> 52:54.060]  We've been here for a year.
[52:54.060 --> 52:57.060]  We've read the Deloitte and Tush articles and we've listened.
[52:57.060 --> 53:00.060]  We've listened to two hours of future cannabis project.
[53:00.060 --> 53:04.060]  And we've read a few articles and we really have wrapped our heads around
[53:04.060 --> 53:07.060]  the system. So we are now we people and we're going to put the regulations in.
[53:07.060 --> 53:10.060]  So we're going to lay it out and this is a good system and this is going to
[53:10.060 --> 53:14.060]  work because it worked in tobacco and that's a relatable industry because
[53:14.060 --> 53:16.060]  we're trying to take circles and put them into squares.
[53:16.060 --> 53:18.060]  And so it was not rushed.
[53:18.060 --> 53:19.060]  It was thought out.
[53:19.060 --> 53:21.060]  It was thought out by the wrong people.
[53:22.060 --> 53:24.060]  Fair enough. Well said. Well said.
[53:25.060 --> 53:27.060]  Mike truck. Boom.
[53:27.060 --> 53:30.060]  Anyway, what are you taking smokes off of?
[53:30.060 --> 53:31.060]  Bro, I'm smoking.
[53:31.060 --> 53:32.060]  Let's hear about it.
[53:32.060 --> 53:34.060]  What's in it? You got all these amazing people.
[53:34.060 --> 53:37.060]  First of all, Dragonfire Medicine is blasting me with some amazing stuff.
[53:37.060 --> 53:41.060]  So that the short, the what was I smoking yesterday?
[53:41.060 --> 53:43.060]  That was strawberry guava.
[53:44.060 --> 53:46.060]  No, man, I'm just maintaining.
[53:47.060 --> 53:52.060]  Yeah, no, I think I think Canadian Dabs is standing out for me.
[53:52.060 --> 53:56.060]  It's my good buddy out of Calgary at Canadian Dabs 403.
[53:56.060 --> 54:00.060]  He's got a fruit joy, which is a Barbara Bud Cross.
[54:00.060 --> 54:04.060]  There's some concentrated X that bubble man's rock and I haven't been
[54:04.060 --> 54:06.060]  blasted yet. I'm going to keep it over here for him.
[54:06.060 --> 54:07.060]  I will. I will.
[54:07.060 --> 54:08.060]  I will die.
[54:10.060 --> 54:12.060]  And what else do we have?
[54:12.060 --> 54:13.060]  Cool stuff.
[54:13.060 --> 54:14.060]  Cool stuff.
[54:14.060 --> 54:17.060]  Got some, just some hash and.
[54:20.060 --> 54:22.060]  Man, we're smoking pretty deep here.
[54:22.060 --> 54:24.060]  Oh, the naturally farmed guys.
[54:24.060 --> 54:25.060]  That's an organic.
[54:25.060 --> 54:26.060]  Are they newer?
[54:26.060 --> 54:29.060]  Cause I've heard we I've heard you talk about a few of these guys.
[54:29.060 --> 54:32.060]  Is there something new that you're really excited about in there?
[54:32.060 --> 54:34.060]  That's a little bit different or something.
[54:34.060 --> 54:35.060]  No more chicken skin.
[54:35.060 --> 54:36.060]  I've never smoked.
[54:36.060 --> 54:39.060]  I've been following Dragonfly and like I connected with Josh and Kelly
[54:40.060 --> 54:43.060]  in 2019, very briefly when I was rocking with,
[54:43.060 --> 54:47.060]  I was down there with Kevin Jodri and we connected like just in the
[54:47.060 --> 54:50.060]  craziness of the cup and we had a brief conversation,
[54:50.060 --> 54:52.060]  but I've been following what they've been doing and.
[54:52.060 --> 54:54.060]  Oh, sorry. Big fans of what they're doing.
[54:54.060 --> 54:58.060]  And so, and so we got to just connect, you know,
[54:58.060 --> 55:01.060]  yesterday really in a meaningful way.
[55:01.060 --> 55:04.060]  And it was cool and getting sit down and taste, you know,
[55:04.060 --> 55:07.060]  the turps and I know the love and care that goes into it.
[55:07.060 --> 55:08.060]  Cause you know, I'm blessed enough.
[55:08.060 --> 55:11.060]  I get to travel around and smoke hash and a lot of it.
[55:11.060 --> 55:14.060]  And so I can tell, you know, and, and tasting those,
[55:14.060 --> 55:18.060]  those organically grown, you know, light depths, ungrown.
[55:18.060 --> 55:20.060]  It was really nice.
[55:20.060 --> 55:23.060]  I haven't even gotten through all of them, but I just,
[55:23.060 --> 55:26.060]  I just landed yesterday and I've got all day today and tomorrow.
[55:26.060 --> 55:28.060]  So lots of time.
[55:28.060 --> 55:31.060]  Give thanks.
[55:31.060 --> 55:34.060]  Jameson has been sweet connecting and, and,
[55:34.060 --> 55:37.060]  and doing good things and it's fun.
[55:37.060 --> 55:40.060]  I like watching you take hits, bro. I like taking it.
[55:40.060 --> 55:43.060]  It works. Yeah, I guess so.
[55:43.060 --> 55:45.060]  I mean, it makes me happy.
[55:45.060 --> 55:48.060]  Tell us a little bit about what you're doing here in the Canadian market.
[55:48.060 --> 55:50.060]  Cause you're kind of like sweet. You're okay.
[55:50.060 --> 55:54.060]  So Jameson's also going back and forth between the U S and like working
[55:54.060 --> 55:56.060]  with amazing, like, you know,
[55:56.060 --> 55:59.060]  like the people that are doing the work and the people that are doing the
[55:59.060 --> 56:02.060]  work and the people that are doing the work.
[56:02.060 --> 56:05.060]  So you're also going back and forth between the U S and like working with
[56:05.060 --> 56:08.060]  amazing, like makers and crafters and cultivators and brands.
[56:08.060 --> 56:11.060]  And then also making that bridge to Canada.
[56:11.060 --> 56:14.060]  Yeah, I just, you know,
[56:14.060 --> 56:18.060]  I've been involved in the legal cannabis space since 2016 and you know,
[56:18.060 --> 56:21.060]  been touching the plant since probably 2006.
[56:21.060 --> 56:24.060]  And what I saw in legal cannabis was a lot of people moving in who maybe
[56:24.060 --> 56:27.060]  weren't excelling in other industries.
[56:27.060 --> 56:32.060]  Sorry, who maybe weren't excelling in other industries and shifted over to
[56:32.060 --> 56:36.060]  to see how it would work in the, in the great gold mine of legal cannabis.
[56:36.060 --> 56:41.060]  And I think that a lot of the true innovators in the space stayed behind and
[56:41.060 --> 56:46.060]  continued to do the work that they set out to do and didn't see legalization
[56:46.060 --> 56:50.060]  for, I think what a lot of outsiders saw it as, which was a big cash grab.
[56:50.060 --> 56:55.060]  And so I have been a part of three successful startups in the U S and
[56:57.060 --> 56:58.060]  in the space.
[56:58.060 --> 57:03.060]  I now work for myself as a consulting company called the Banyan tree and we
[57:05.060 --> 57:08.060]  represent a number of groups and we help,
[57:08.060 --> 57:10.060]  we basically help groups transition from legacy to legal.
[57:10.060 --> 57:13.060]  So identifying your IP and really understanding that, Hey, you know,
[57:13.060 --> 57:18.060]  maybe you're an, a legacy operator in a certain market, but, and,
[57:18.060 --> 57:22.060]  and you think that because of the legislation that's come out,
[57:22.060 --> 57:26.060]  you're not going to be able to transition that brand into the legal market in,
[57:26.060 --> 57:29.060]  in your area. That might be true for that time.
[57:29.060 --> 57:33.060]  But remember that when legalization happened in Canada,
[57:33.060 --> 57:38.060]  they said that any brand operating in the traditional space after October 17,
[57:38.060 --> 57:43.060]  2018 would not be allowed to transition into the legal space.
[57:44.060 --> 57:49.060]  There are now traditional brands who have started post October 17,
[57:50.060 --> 57:55.060]  2018 and now are actually in the legal market legacy to legal.
[57:55.060 --> 57:58.060]  And so understanding that there's more value in,
[57:58.060 --> 58:02.060]  in what you're making than just what's inside that jar.
[58:02.060 --> 58:06.060]  And, and I can, I can bridge that gap between the roots and the suits.
[58:06.060 --> 58:08.060]  I've worked on the corporate side. I've, I've seen the thing.
[58:08.060 --> 58:11.060]  You can Google my name and see some really funny pictures of me in suits.
[58:11.060 --> 58:16.060]  And yeah, bubble man met me in a suit, man. And, and you know what?
[58:17.060 --> 58:19.060]  I saw what I needed to see on that side. I, I, I,
[58:19.060 --> 58:23.060]  I gleaned what I needed to glean and I'm completely here because there's a lot
[58:23.060 --> 58:26.060]  of bullshit in this industry. There's a lot of imposters in this industry.
[58:26.060 --> 58:30.060]  There's a lot of bloated marketing teams that are being paid way too much
[58:30.060 --> 58:33.060]  fucking money to make up brands that are going to fail.
[58:33.060 --> 58:37.060]  And ultimately these companies are going to have to come to brands,
[58:37.060 --> 58:41.060]  legacy brands that are already existing and buy their brand to leverage that
[58:41.060 --> 58:46.060]  brands equity that it's built on its quality to then ultimately either
[58:46.060 --> 58:50.060]  continue building that brand or more likely destroy that brand over a number of
[58:50.060 --> 58:54.060]  years. But I'm here to identify quality in different markets.
[58:54.060 --> 58:57.060]  As a boots on the ground guy, I'm not a keyboard warrior.
[58:57.060 --> 59:00.060]  I'm not going to video chat you or FaceTime you.
[59:00.060 --> 59:02.060]  I'm going to jump on a plane and go see you.
[59:02.060 --> 59:06.060]  And then once I identify a group I want to work with,
[59:06.060 --> 59:10.060]  I identify a market that I would see valuable to leverage that group into.
[59:10.060 --> 59:14.060]  And I'm just really about connecting real cannabis people because this
[59:14.060 --> 59:17.060]  industry is made up by a bunch of imposters most of the time.
[59:17.060 --> 59:20.060]  And it's a lot of people here just for the benefit of money.
[59:20.060 --> 59:22.060]  And this plant has given me way more than money.
[59:22.060 --> 59:26.060]  And so I'm kind of here ready to connect the individuals that need to be
[59:26.060 --> 59:32.060]  connected because ultimately like the traditional space has bred a very clutch
[59:32.060 --> 59:38.060]  and look culture where we'll see what others are doing and maybe we'll have a
[59:38.060 --> 59:41.060]  feeling about it or we've walked down that path.
[59:41.060 --> 59:44.060]  But we're just going to let them do their own thing because we don't want to
[59:44.060 --> 59:46.060]  step on anybody's toes or maybe come off as offensive.
[59:46.060 --> 59:50.060]  Whereas like all these chads and brads are calling each other every day,
[59:50.060 --> 59:52.060]  multiple times a day like, Hey Bill,
[59:52.060 --> 59:54.060]  so how'd it work with that black market guy?
[59:54.060 --> 59:56.060]  And he'd be like, Oh, well I offered him this deal.
[59:56.060 --> 59:59.060]  And then I low balled him and I offered him that and said he could have some
[59:59.060 --> 01:00:02.060]  shares, but he'd have to hold onto him for five years.
[01:00:02.060 --> 01:00:04.060]  And he bit and he's like, Oh great. Okay.
[01:00:04.060 --> 01:00:05.060]  I'm going to use it on my guy.
[01:00:05.060 --> 01:00:07.060]  I'm talking to a black market guy right now.
[01:00:07.060 --> 01:00:08.060]  Like I'll work on that one.
[01:00:08.060 --> 01:00:11.060]  And so, and that's going on every day,
[01:00:11.060 --> 01:00:14.060]  but we're not talking to each other as, as, as,
[01:00:14.060 --> 01:00:17.060]  as legacy market people and, and, you know,
[01:00:17.060 --> 01:00:21.060]  shout out to Marcus and guys like that who have been able to with their,
[01:00:21.060 --> 01:00:24.060]  with, with what they've built, you know, build their own thing.
[01:00:24.060 --> 01:00:30.060]  But the traditional market guys aren't communicating and are overwhelmed with
[01:00:30.060 --> 01:00:32.060]  what's been built.
[01:00:32.060 --> 01:00:35.060]  And so we need to like bridge those gaps and open up those communications and
[01:00:35.060 --> 01:00:42.060]  not get so hung up on these kind of like cult cultures of solvents and
[01:00:42.060 --> 01:00:45.060]  solvent lists and organics and salts and, you know,
[01:00:45.060 --> 01:00:47.060]  all these things and understand like, you know,
[01:00:47.060 --> 01:00:50.060]  if you're passionate and you've been here and you've been doing this and this
[01:00:50.060 --> 01:00:52.060]  isn't like, you know, something that you just like, Hey,
[01:00:52.060 --> 01:00:55.060]  crypto wasn't working out for me.
[01:00:55.060 --> 01:01:00.060]  And you know, my, my other business wasn't working and, you know,
[01:01:00.060 --> 01:01:01.060]  maybe I'll try cannabis.
[01:01:02.060 --> 01:01:05.060]  Then, you know, these people need to connect and communicate.
[01:01:05.060 --> 01:01:08.060]  And I think doing things like the unicorn cop and the regenerative cannabis
[01:01:08.060 --> 01:01:12.060]  the regenerative cannabis conferences hosted by dash blooms.
[01:01:12.060 --> 01:01:15.060]  I think those things are beautiful bringing the community together.
[01:01:15.060 --> 01:01:17.060]  And those are, those are, those are events where you, if you're not about it,
[01:01:17.060 --> 01:01:19.060]  you'll stand out like a sore thumb.
[01:01:19.060 --> 01:01:21.060]  And even if you look like you're about it, but you're not about it,
[01:01:21.060 --> 01:01:23.060]  you'll get snuffed out quick.
[01:01:23.060 --> 01:01:27.060]  So, you know, it's, it's, it's, those are, those are,
[01:01:27.060 --> 01:01:30.060]  those are the places that I enjoy and that's a little bit about me.
[01:01:30.060 --> 01:01:32.060]  So what do you say to somebody who's approaching the market?
[01:01:32.060 --> 01:01:35.060]  Cause right now we have a lot of people that have a lot of interest in
[01:01:35.060 --> 01:01:37.060]  approaching and being part of the culture.
[01:01:37.060 --> 01:01:40.060]  And that sounds a little bit like we're going to push them away. Right.
[01:01:40.060 --> 01:01:43.060]  Is that like, is that not the concern? Don't get me wrong.
[01:01:43.060 --> 01:01:46.060]  There's an elitism there, but we were, we're welcoming stoners, you know,
[01:01:46.060 --> 01:01:49.060]  like we want people to be part of a community and grow that community.
[01:01:49.060 --> 01:01:53.060]  And there's, there's an amount of respect that because we're a culture that
[01:01:53.060 --> 01:01:55.060]  doesn't have this hierarchy that's built in,
[01:01:55.060 --> 01:01:59.060]  like you see in corporate culture where you have to climb that ladder.
[01:01:59.060 --> 01:02:02.060]  Some people come in and think that that doesn't exist, but you know,
[01:02:02.060 --> 01:02:09.060]  there's years that we spent Marcus included quietly listening and not talking
[01:02:09.060 --> 01:02:13.060]  in circles and absorbing things and leveling up our knowledge before we
[01:02:13.060 --> 01:02:17.060]  started talking. And when we started talking, it wasn't just from listening.
[01:02:17.060 --> 01:02:19.060]  It wasn't from just, Oh, well,
[01:02:19.060 --> 01:02:21.060]  we've sat around in enough circles and absorb enough.
[01:02:21.060 --> 01:02:25.060]  It was from going and fucking doing, it was from popping seeds.
[01:02:25.060 --> 01:02:27.060]  It was from making hash. It was from growing shit.
[01:02:27.060 --> 01:02:29.060]  And I think that there's a lot of people that think that, you know,
[01:02:29.060 --> 01:02:34.060]  if I absorb enough culture via other people and listening to stories that I can
[01:02:34.060 --> 01:02:36.060]  kind of skip over the actual doing part of it.
[01:02:36.060 --> 01:02:41.060]  And I think that honoring and understanding that is super important.
[01:02:41.060 --> 01:02:46.060]  And I think that the real people from the culture recognize those people and
[01:02:46.060 --> 01:02:49.060]  they don't recognize that we recognize it, but it happens.
[01:02:49.060 --> 01:02:51.060]  And so I think that there's a hierarchy,
[01:02:51.060 --> 01:02:53.060]  there's levels to it that you have to understand.
[01:02:53.060 --> 01:02:56.060]  It's like, I would never give somebody full melt bubble hash as their first
[01:02:56.060 --> 01:02:58.060]  stab. I think that would be corrupting them.
[01:02:58.060 --> 01:03:01.060]  I think that you need to go through, you know, your,
[01:03:01.060 --> 01:03:05.060]  your whole evolution of, you know, smoking a dirtier oil or, or,
[01:03:05.060 --> 01:03:08.060]  or a shattered shatter and then going through and,
[01:03:08.060 --> 01:03:13.060]  and smoking HTF a C and then smoking cleaner HTF a C and then becoming like
[01:03:13.060 --> 01:03:16.060]  thinking at some point, like, this is all I'm going to smoke.
[01:03:16.060 --> 01:03:18.060]  And then like taking your journey,
[01:03:18.060 --> 01:03:20.060]  a hundred percent getting to be on your journey,
[01:03:20.060 --> 01:03:24.060]  not have to start at the top or the end or whatever you want to call it,
[01:03:24.060 --> 01:03:28.060]  where we've acquired or found ourselves to be here today. And this is,
[01:03:28.060 --> 01:03:32.060]  this really speaks to, you know, the, my own brand that I'm fine.
[01:03:32.060 --> 01:03:34.060]  I've never released bubble man brand. It's been, you know,
[01:03:34.060 --> 01:03:36.060]  I've been selling bubble bags for 23 years,
[01:03:36.060 --> 01:03:38.060]  sold them into over 200 countries,
[01:03:38.060 --> 01:03:42.060]  taught like tens of thousands of people how to make hash. And now the,
[01:03:42.060 --> 01:03:44.060]  all of my friends have your back.
[01:03:44.060 --> 01:03:45.060]  That's what's up.
[01:03:45.060 --> 01:03:49.060]  Oh yeah. You do. Oh yeah. You guys do. That's awesome. So, you know,
[01:03:50.060 --> 01:03:54.060]  that part of the culture was so like, there was no,
[01:03:54.060 --> 01:03:58.060]  nothing was to affect the integrity of that because there was no,
[01:03:58.060 --> 01:03:59.060]  it was just the honest, like,
[01:03:59.060 --> 01:04:02.060]  I'm just teaching people how to make hash and that was the business.
[01:04:02.060 --> 01:04:05.060]  But now it's like this dangerous, like, you know, I,
[01:04:05.060 --> 01:04:09.060]  I started my company and bark and I kind of flirted with the idea of wanting to
[01:04:09.060 --> 01:04:11.060]  do the brand. And then we got a leadership team in that I,
[01:04:11.060 --> 01:04:15.060]  I didn't see eye to eye with. And I was kind of like, Oh, like,
[01:04:15.060 --> 01:04:17.060]  I don't know if I want to do the brand with my own company.
[01:04:17.060 --> 01:04:20.060]  And it took a while for this leadership team to sort of, you know,
[01:04:20.060 --> 01:04:24.060]  move on and get in. And, you know, recently we were acquired by Bev Canna.
[01:04:24.060 --> 01:04:26.060]  And I was worried about that. I was like, Oh my God,
[01:04:26.060 --> 01:04:29.060]  I don't know who these guys are. Well, these are the first, I guess they're,
[01:04:29.060 --> 01:04:31.060]  I guess they're corporate,
[01:04:31.060 --> 01:04:36.060]  but they're the first corporate dudes I've met that are actually cool and kind
[01:04:36.060 --> 01:04:41.060]  and spiritual and have depth and like are actually people that would be sitting
[01:04:41.060 --> 01:04:44.060]  at this table and having a dab with us. Like, they're just really,
[01:04:44.060 --> 01:04:46.060]  really good dudes. They're doing beverages and whatnot,
[01:04:46.060 --> 01:04:50.060]  but they came in with Embark and now they've created a team where I'm like
[01:04:50.060 --> 01:04:52.060]  confident and I want to do the brand.
[01:04:52.060 --> 01:04:55.060]  And it was really hard for me because my brand was going to be nothing but the
[01:04:55.060 --> 01:04:59.060]  highest quality, what everyone knows me for. But what he just said,
[01:04:59.060 --> 01:05:03.060]  you can't start someone out with a full melt dab of hash.
[01:05:03.060 --> 01:05:07.060]  And so what my real mission now is with my brand in particular,
[01:05:07.060 --> 01:05:11.060]  will I have dabs available, full melt dry sifts and bubbles and,
[01:05:11.060 --> 01:05:15.060]  and, and rosins? Yeah, absolutely. Four stars and up will be available.
[01:05:16.060 --> 01:05:20.060]  But what's going to be available for the people that right now only smoke joints
[01:05:20.060 --> 01:05:22.060]  and all they have is a tool.
[01:05:22.060 --> 01:05:25.060]  Like look at how many tools Jamison and I have out on the table right now.
[01:05:25.060 --> 01:05:29.060]  It's bat shit fucking crit. No, between me and Jamison, I bet you there's 50.
[01:05:29.060 --> 01:05:33.060]  So it's unrealistic for, for, to think that people are going to do that.
[01:05:33.060 --> 01:05:38.060]  So now we've got to create products that are like hash that they can smoke.
[01:05:38.060 --> 01:05:40.060]  That's that all they need is a lighter.
[01:05:40.060 --> 01:05:42.060]  So we came out with that pure hash stick,
[01:05:42.060 --> 01:05:45.060]  which is a legacy product that's all day long. Hayward and Cheryl,
[01:05:45.060 --> 01:05:48.060]  that's their baby. They created it. Shout out to them from the Kootenays.
[01:05:48.060 --> 01:05:50.060]  We brought them into our family.
[01:05:50.060 --> 01:05:53.060]  We made a great deal with them where everyone gets, you know,
[01:05:53.060 --> 01:05:54.060]  like they're a part of it.
[01:05:54.060 --> 01:05:56.060]  It's not like they get five grand and now go away.
[01:05:56.060 --> 01:05:58.060]  You're never seeing any money again.
[01:05:58.060 --> 01:06:01.060]  So they're a part of it because that was their, they owned no IP.
[01:06:01.060 --> 01:06:06.060]  They owned no patents. We did that because it was the right thing to do.
[01:06:06.060 --> 01:06:08.060]  So there are partners in the hazel stick.
[01:06:09.060 --> 01:06:12.060]  We're the only ones selling it in Canada and people are now smoking hash that
[01:06:12.060 --> 01:06:14.060]  would otherwise never smoke hash.
[01:06:14.060 --> 01:06:19.060]  The mistake was is that COVID came in and you can't share them.
[01:06:19.060 --> 01:06:24.060]  So now it's the hash hit, which I just showed him today.
[01:06:24.060 --> 01:06:27.060]  This is the newest product that we're about to release.
[01:06:27.060 --> 01:06:31.060]  And this is, this is just five.
[01:06:31.060 --> 01:06:33.060]  There's four because I gave this gentleman one,
[01:06:33.060 --> 01:06:37.060]  but it's five paper one hit tubes with stainless steel bowls that fit 0.2 of a
[01:06:38.060 --> 01:06:41.060]  gram of hash in the end of them. So when you buy a gram of hash,
[01:06:41.060 --> 01:06:45.060]  you'll get five of those tubes with a 0.2 ready to go.
[01:06:45.060 --> 01:06:48.060]  And you just, it's just a quick little smoking tube.
[01:06:48.060 --> 01:06:51.060]  The paper doesn't burn. It's recyclable. You can, you know,
[01:06:51.060 --> 01:06:55.060]  it's not overly wasteful. Yeah. I filled that one up for him.
[01:06:55.060 --> 01:06:59.060]  So, and now this is very far from what you might think is a bubble man product,
[01:06:59.060 --> 01:07:03.060]  but it's about what Jameson said going back.
[01:07:03.060 --> 01:07:06.060]  And now we've got a whole new group of people in Canada that are getting
[01:07:06.060 --> 01:07:10.060]  onto cannabis. And the only thing they've ever done is smoked a joint.
[01:07:10.060 --> 01:07:12.060]  And so if the only thing they've ever done is smoked a joint,
[01:07:12.060 --> 01:07:16.060]  how can I get them into hash and make it convenient for them and make it so
[01:07:16.060 --> 01:07:18.060]  like, well, I've never really smoked hash. It's 20.
[01:07:18.060 --> 01:07:21.060]  It's the same price as a gram of hash.
[01:07:21.060 --> 01:07:24.060]  It's just broken up into a convenient serving.
[01:07:24.060 --> 01:07:27.060]  And each tube gives you about five to 10 rips.
[01:07:27.060 --> 01:07:30.060]  So we're kind of excited about it. We'll see how it goes.
[01:07:30.060 --> 01:07:34.060]  You know, it's a different marketplace when you're selling to this,
[01:07:34.060 --> 01:07:39.060]  you know, a lot of the dabbing culture has not switched over to this market.
[01:07:39.060 --> 01:07:41.060]  They're, they produce their own flowers.
[01:07:41.060 --> 01:07:43.060]  They produce their own rosin and bubble.
[01:07:43.060 --> 01:07:47.060]  And Marcus, it has a cool metal bowl on the inside.
[01:07:47.060 --> 01:07:48.060]  It's a stainless steel bowl. Yeah.
[01:07:48.060 --> 01:07:52.060]  With five little holes. We put just 0.2 of a gram of hash in there.
[01:07:52.060 --> 01:07:54.060]  And you just, yeah, you puff that down.
[01:07:54.060 --> 01:07:57.060]  Now I haven't smoked hash in like 20 years.
[01:07:57.060 --> 01:08:01.060]  I haven't smoked flower in 22 years. I just dab hash.
[01:08:01.060 --> 01:08:04.060]  So when we thought of this product, I was like, well, I'm going to have to try it.
[01:08:04.060 --> 01:08:07.060]  I can't put my name on something I don't believe in.
[01:08:07.060 --> 01:08:11.060]  So what, well, listen, what I found was I was on the top of Whistler Mountain.
[01:08:11.060 --> 01:08:13.060]  I tripped. I tripped.
[01:08:13.060 --> 01:08:16.060]  I know, people did. It's just another way for me to inhale hash.
[01:08:16.060 --> 01:08:19.060]  But I hadn't smoked hash in 20 years.
[01:08:19.060 --> 01:08:23.060]  And when I did cough a little bit, what I found was amazing was that
[01:08:23.060 --> 01:08:28.060]  it got me this very light, mellow high because I have a very high tolerance.
[01:08:28.060 --> 01:08:31.060]  I'm used to a trip to the moon every time I take a dab.
[01:08:31.060 --> 01:08:35.060]  This was super mellow. I just skateboarded around like downtown Vancouver.
[01:08:35.060 --> 01:08:38.060]  I did it one time up on Whistler Mountain.
[01:08:38.060 --> 01:08:42.060]  You know, the places where I don't have my 17 items to dab with
[01:08:42.060 --> 01:08:47.060]  and my wash bay and my temp, terp timer and all this insane shit.
[01:08:47.060 --> 01:08:49.060]  This is the polar opposite of that.
[01:08:49.060 --> 01:08:52.060]  This is like easy peasy convenience.
[01:08:53.060 --> 01:08:54.060]  On the go.
[01:08:54.060 --> 01:09:00.060]  I think this cannabis world, the new cannabis world, will really appreciate that
[01:09:00.060 --> 01:09:03.060]  because they do in every other aspect of their life.
[01:09:04.060 --> 01:09:05.060]  Do you know what I'm saying?
[01:09:05.060 --> 01:09:06.060]  Of course.
[01:09:06.060 --> 01:09:07.060]  Yeah.
[01:09:09.390 --> 01:09:10.390]  Well, that was a long rant.
[01:09:10.390 --> 01:09:14.390]  I can say that feeling you just described from smoking that hash,
[01:09:14.390 --> 01:09:15.390]  I got a very similar thing.
[01:09:15.390 --> 01:09:18.390]  I went down and gave old Johnny a hand with all his flood issues
[01:09:18.390 --> 01:09:20.390]  and all the stuff down there pretty recently.
[01:09:20.390 --> 01:09:23.390]  In return, he smoked me out very fair
[01:09:23.390 --> 01:09:28.390]  and started the morning off with his Full Melt out of his little special Full Melt rig.
[01:09:28.390 --> 01:09:29.390]  Yeah, the same thing.
[01:09:29.390 --> 01:09:34.390]  It wasn't overwhelming, but it was just this nice, relaxing, perfect way to start the day
[01:09:34.390 --> 01:09:35.390]  and get some work done.
[01:09:35.390 --> 01:09:42.390]  I think Full Melt is the least functional of all the things that we smoke, honestly, bro.
[01:09:42.390 --> 01:09:43.390]  Not easy.
[01:09:43.390 --> 01:09:48.390]  I think Full Melt is like walking in deep, soft sand.
[01:09:48.390 --> 01:09:49.390]  You got to be ready.
[01:09:50.390 --> 01:09:53.390]  Starting a work day with a basement flood and being like,
[01:09:53.390 --> 01:09:56.390]  hey, do you want some rosin or do you want some Full Melt?
[01:09:56.390 --> 01:09:59.390]  Like 10 out of 10 of the days, I'm taking the rosin.
[01:09:59.390 --> 01:10:00.390]  The answer is obviously bubble.
[01:10:00.390 --> 01:10:02.390]  Because rosin is dessert.
[01:10:03.390 --> 01:10:09.390]  Rosin is dessert and bubble, Full Melt bubble is like a six-course meal.
[01:10:09.390 --> 01:10:14.390]  You filtered things out from the bubble to make the rosin
[01:10:14.390 --> 01:10:20.390]  and those things that you filtered out are what makes the bubble different from the rosin.
[01:10:20.390 --> 01:10:24.390]  What you've really filtered out is the fibrous mat inside the trichome head
[01:10:24.390 --> 01:10:29.390]  where all of the cannabinoids and terpenes are produced into existence, the lab.
[01:10:29.390 --> 01:10:34.390]  So that lab, I mean, dude, there's all sorts of good things in there.
[01:10:34.390 --> 01:10:37.390]  And it's the difference that you don't get when you smoke like a cultivar
[01:10:37.390 --> 01:10:40.390]  that you have Full Melt of that you maybe pressed rosin into.
[01:10:40.390 --> 01:10:45.390]  You can smoke them both and you'll just feel they're not the same.
[01:10:45.390 --> 01:10:47.390]  Like in any way, shape or form.
[01:10:49.390 --> 01:10:50.390]  I love it.
[01:10:50.390 --> 01:10:51.390]  The hash rosins, of course.
[01:10:51.390 --> 01:10:52.390]  Me too.
[01:10:52.390 --> 01:10:56.390]  But the same page, the bubbles are just so nice.
[01:10:56.390 --> 01:10:58.390]  It's just full. There's just a little something extra to it.
[01:11:11.100 --> 01:11:13.100]  It's a beautiful day here.
[01:11:17.100 --> 01:11:24.100]  Yeah, I'm sort of much older school, you know, joints and hash and other things.
[01:11:24.100 --> 01:11:26.100]  I've been learning more about dabs.
[01:11:26.100 --> 01:11:29.100]  I mean, I have done them before, but I'm just not really.
[01:11:29.100 --> 01:11:32.100]  This is a whole new world where you have a whole kit.
[01:11:32.100 --> 01:11:34.100]  It used to be so much simpler.
[01:11:35.100 --> 01:11:38.100]  I remember how awesome dabs are.
[01:11:43.100 --> 01:11:48.100]  I like the effect of it, but I would kind of like to have it simpler.
[01:11:48.100 --> 01:11:52.100]  And sort of the torch thing is a bit freaky to me, really, to be honest.
[01:11:52.100 --> 01:11:56.100]  So, you know, because I think somebody could drop it or burn themselves.
[01:11:56.100 --> 01:11:58.100]  They're like, that's just a danger.
[01:11:58.100 --> 01:12:00.100]  And that's very hot.
[01:12:00.100 --> 01:12:03.100]  Yeah, the electric thing seems like a good idea.
[01:12:04.100 --> 01:12:05.100]  It's really nice.
[01:12:09.100 --> 01:12:11.100]  Yeah, I like the effect of it.
[01:12:11.100 --> 01:12:14.100]  So I'd like to find one that is not a million dollars.
[01:12:14.100 --> 01:12:16.100]  It has to be sort of really reasonable.
[01:12:16.100 --> 01:12:21.100]  And, yeah, it has to be effective, right?
[01:12:21.100 --> 01:12:22.100]  And whatever that takes.
[01:12:22.100 --> 01:12:26.100]  So that's what I've learned about dabbing today.
[01:12:26.100 --> 01:12:28.100]  And, yeah.
[01:12:28.100 --> 01:12:29.100]  Yeah.
[01:12:32.100 --> 01:12:34.100]  We have a dab monster in front of us.
[01:12:34.100 --> 01:12:35.100]  A dab monster.
[01:12:35.100 --> 01:12:36.100]  Oh, yeah.
[01:12:36.100 --> 01:12:38.100]  She is a dab monster.
[01:12:38.100 --> 01:12:40.100]  Kelly is a dab monster.
[01:12:40.100 --> 01:12:41.100]  Kelly.
[01:12:41.100 --> 01:12:44.100]  No, it looks like she does, though.
[01:12:44.100 --> 01:12:46.100]  She's a dab queen.
[01:12:46.100 --> 01:12:48.100]  She can take a dab, a big one.
[01:12:52.100 --> 01:12:53.100]  Oh, yeah.
[01:12:54.100 --> 01:12:55.100]  Excellent.
[01:12:56.100 --> 01:13:02.070]  You keep saying awesome, hilarious things, and you don't have a mic.
[01:13:02.070 --> 01:13:06.070]  It's like, man, I wish you had that mic.
[01:13:06.070 --> 01:13:07.070]  You never know when they're going to come out, you know what I mean?
[01:13:17.070 --> 01:13:18.070]  What was it again?
[01:13:18.070 --> 01:13:20.070]  Two thumbs up for two tears down.
[01:13:20.070 --> 01:13:22.070]  That's amazing.
[01:13:22.070 --> 01:13:23.070]  I love that.
[01:13:24.070 --> 01:13:26.070]  Two thumbs up, two tears down.
[01:13:26.070 --> 01:13:28.070]  Hashtag bubble man said it first.
[01:13:28.070 --> 01:13:34.070]  Six weeks from now, the big corporate cannabis companies will have that on a T-shirt.
[01:13:34.070 --> 01:13:36.070]  And they will be monetizing that.
[01:13:36.070 --> 01:13:38.070]  So, yeah, they'll be suing.
[01:13:38.070 --> 01:13:39.070]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:13:39.070 --> 01:13:41.070]  And there will be copyright infringement.
[01:13:41.070 --> 01:13:42.070]  This part will be cut out.
[01:13:42.070 --> 01:13:43.070]  Oh.
[01:13:45.070 --> 01:13:47.070]  Yeah, fucking wonderful.
[01:13:47.070 --> 01:13:48.070]  This is great.
[01:13:48.070 --> 01:13:49.070]  Bro, they love that.
[01:13:49.070 --> 01:13:51.070]  Why do you have to say something so intelligent?
[01:13:51.070 --> 01:13:52.070]  Two thumbs up, two tears down.
[01:13:53.070 --> 01:13:54.070]  They really took that and ran with it.
[01:13:58.070 --> 01:14:00.070]  It takes a while to get through all the Terps.
[01:14:00.070 --> 01:14:01.070]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:14:01.070 --> 01:14:03.070]  Pass some of these beautiful.
[01:14:03.070 --> 01:14:04.070]  Yeah, let's do it.
[01:14:04.070 --> 01:14:06.070]  We've been enjoying the strawberry guava.
[01:14:07.070 --> 01:14:10.070]  Definitely the glazed jelly and glazed cherries.
[01:14:10.070 --> 01:14:13.070]  We got a couple of glazed varieties, which is a glazed cherry.
[01:14:14.070 --> 01:14:18.070]  The Terps on some of these dragonfly jars are just incredible.
[01:14:18.070 --> 01:14:20.070]  And the star dog guava wookie.
[01:14:20.070 --> 01:14:21.070]  That one.
[01:14:21.070 --> 01:14:22.070]  By Homesteader.
[01:14:22.070 --> 01:14:23.070]  Super interesting.
[01:14:23.070 --> 01:14:25.070]  It's like really glossy on top.
[01:14:25.070 --> 01:14:26.070]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:14:26.070 --> 01:14:27.070]  There's a lot going on in there.
[01:14:27.070 --> 01:14:30.070]  And it has that kind of chem doggy kind of look.
[01:14:30.070 --> 01:14:34.070]  I didn't even go through all the jars last night, but I went back to that more than once.
[01:14:34.070 --> 01:14:35.070]  Yeah, yeah, try that one.
[01:14:35.070 --> 01:14:40.070]  And we got this strawberry short cookies from some family in BC.
[01:14:40.070 --> 01:14:41.070]  I haven't tasted that yesterday.
[01:14:41.070 --> 01:14:43.070]  Pemberton, Josh and Christy, bless up.
[01:14:46.070 --> 01:14:47.070]  And it's really good.
[01:14:47.070 --> 01:14:54.070]  We got this Acapulco gold, lamb's bread and violator.
[01:14:55.070 --> 01:14:57.070]  There was three different varieties.
[01:14:57.070 --> 01:14:59.070]  I think there was, I feel like there was one more.
[01:14:59.070 --> 01:15:02.070]  But anyway, so we brought the lamb's bread and the Acapulco gold.
[01:15:02.070 --> 01:15:10.070]  And it's really sweet because it really kind of took on the land racy varietal aspect of it.
[01:15:10.070 --> 01:15:12.070]  So this Acapulco gold, you can check it out.
[01:15:12.070 --> 01:15:26.070]  It has that kind of turpine lean, kind of lemony upper and kind of Acapulco gold vibration to it, which is nice.
[01:15:30.340 --> 01:15:32.340]  And go ahead.
[01:15:32.340 --> 01:15:35.340]  Oh, there's no, there's no.
[01:15:35.340 --> 01:15:36.340]  It is.
[01:15:36.340 --> 01:15:37.340]  Try one of these.
[01:15:37.340 --> 01:15:38.340]  What's up?
[01:15:38.340 --> 01:15:39.340]  Yeah.
[01:15:39.340 --> 01:15:40.340]  Yeah.
[01:15:41.340 --> 01:15:43.340]  And this guava punch, like, how are you doing?
[01:15:43.340 --> 01:15:46.340]  Like big up to Kush Kirk.
[01:15:47.340 --> 01:15:48.340]  Kelly's a flower girl.
[01:15:48.340 --> 01:15:51.340]  So and she so she's been in love in this glazed cherries flower.
[01:15:52.340 --> 01:15:53.340]  Right.
[01:15:53.340 --> 01:15:54.340]  Where are you going?
[01:15:56.340 --> 01:15:57.340]  Love you, Selena.
[01:15:57.340 --> 01:15:58.340]  Kelly.
[01:16:00.340 --> 01:16:02.340]  Zellie Mimosa, Tangy.
[01:16:04.340 --> 01:16:05.340]  Punch breath guava.
[01:16:07.340 --> 01:16:08.340]  Which came from Kush Kirk.
[01:16:08.340 --> 01:16:13.340]  Brandon, this punch breath guava, guava punch and punch breath.
[01:16:14.340 --> 01:16:15.340]  Yeah.
[01:16:15.340 --> 01:16:16.340]  Super sweet.
[01:16:16.340 --> 01:16:17.340]  Yeah.
[01:16:19.340 --> 01:16:27.340]  People give me hash and oil all the time, and then I often will bump into them later and they'll be like, hey, what did you think of that?
[01:16:27.340 --> 01:16:30.340]  And then I'm like, OK, if I'm honest, I'm a dick.
[01:16:31.340 --> 01:16:32.340]  If I'm so.
[01:16:32.340 --> 01:16:34.340]  But but then I'm like, where is interesting?
[01:16:35.340 --> 01:16:39.340]  But it also tells you your shit is interesting.
[01:16:40.340 --> 01:16:41.340]  I would never say your shit is bad.
[01:16:41.340 --> 01:16:42.340]  This is what I say.
[01:16:42.340 --> 01:16:47.340]  I say, listen, do you want me to blow smoke up your ass or do you want the Gordon Ramsay?
[01:16:48.340 --> 01:16:51.340]  And all of them have always pretty much requested the Gordon Ramsay.
[01:16:51.340 --> 01:16:54.340]  And that's generally when I'll be like, well, dude, it was like it wasn't good.
[01:16:54.340 --> 01:16:56.340]  Like it was the wax membrane was too thick.
[01:16:56.340 --> 01:16:57.340]  It was hot.
[01:16:57.340 --> 01:17:00.340]  Felt like it was grown with salts, like there was no terpene content.
[01:17:00.340 --> 01:17:03.340]  It was like it didn't stick to get like there's a you know.
[01:17:03.340 --> 01:17:06.340]  But the odd time I'll get something given to me that's spectacular.
[01:17:06.340 --> 01:17:12.340]  And he gave me some of that guava punch breath recently, maybe a week ago or something.
[01:17:12.340 --> 01:17:16.340]  His son was in the neighborhood and stopped by and I've been chuffing on that.
[01:17:16.340 --> 01:17:19.340]  I have it right here. I've been chuffing on that for like a week straight.
[01:17:20.340 --> 01:17:21.340]  I have all sorts of other stuff.
[01:17:21.340 --> 01:17:29.340]  So I'm shouting you out and letting everyone know that that is I mean, it's the nicest stuff you've ever put in my bowl, you know, and you put nice stuff in my bowl before.
[01:17:30.340 --> 01:17:31.340]  But this is the highest level.
[01:17:34.340 --> 01:17:40.340]  Definitely been bringing it up on the farm to the community and, you know, just being a part of everyone's world.
[01:17:40.340 --> 01:17:43.340]  And and even Gary's been making it for a long time.
[01:17:43.340 --> 01:17:49.340]  But, yeah, and and and it's showing up and, you know, it's the way we're growing it.
[01:17:49.340 --> 01:18:02.340]  It's our environment. It's also nice to you know, it's cool to see these strains in British Columbia, you know, and, you know, a lot of times strains get their names get changed when you get brought into the Canadian market.
[01:18:02.340 --> 01:18:05.340]  So that's kind of a bummer in my opinion.
[01:18:05.340 --> 01:18:11.340]  There's like a lot of people putting out like the SKUs in Canada only put out so many cookies, you know, so many of this, so many of that.
[01:18:11.340 --> 01:18:14.340]  And it's like you can't just be the 18th cookie on the roster.
[01:18:14.340 --> 01:18:22.340]  And even Marcus knows like it's weird when you start a company in Canada, you have to create a brand.
[01:18:23.340 --> 01:18:25.340]  And that brand is like I make hash.
[01:18:25.340 --> 01:18:29.340]  It's called so and so whatever name it is.
[01:18:29.340 --> 01:18:32.340]  And it's not even the name of the strain.
[01:18:32.340 --> 01:18:47.340]  So people are out here fighting for like, oh, I would love to have like the farm name, you know, put on there like who cultivated it like everyone, you know, in Oregon, California, it'd be like, you know, you want to see the farm and you know on the product.
[01:18:47.340 --> 01:18:53.340]  And up here in British Columbia, you don't even know what the strain is, for God's sakes, you know, because they change the name and stuff.
[01:18:54.340 --> 01:18:55.340]  So that's kind of weird.
[01:18:55.340 --> 01:19:03.340]  But, you know, since we do travel back and forth and we have a company and now we're dual citizens and we bring stuff.
[01:19:03.340 --> 01:19:06.340]  We haven't gone over the border in a while because, you know, we're humus beings.
[01:19:06.340 --> 01:19:11.340]  Yeah. And the border doesn't recognize humus beings at the moment.
[01:19:12.340 --> 01:19:19.340]  But, you know, we've just been putting it all into making soil and being on the land and just making this amazing product.
[01:19:20.340 --> 01:19:29.340]  You know, Drake and Tara Lee Live and everything that we've been, you know, that she's been up to, you know, people gathering every single day, you know, sharing information.
[01:19:29.340 --> 01:19:32.340]  So, you know, it's beautiful.
[01:19:32.340 --> 01:19:35.340]  We've been making these strains over all these years.
[01:19:35.340 --> 01:19:38.340]  We're on our 16th year on our property, you know.
[01:19:39.340 --> 01:19:40.340]  16 years.
[01:19:40.340 --> 01:19:41.340]  Yeah.
[01:19:41.340 --> 01:19:42.340]  Closed loop all the way?
[01:19:42.340 --> 01:19:43.340]  Oh, yeah.
[01:19:43.340 --> 01:19:44.340]  Oh, yeah.
[01:19:44.340 --> 01:19:46.340]  No, we've been growing closed loop like since the 90s.
[01:19:46.340 --> 01:19:49.340]  What is the most fucked up thing that happens?
[01:19:50.340 --> 01:19:52.340]  There's some challenges when you're out there in the Kootenays.
[01:19:53.340 --> 01:20:07.340]  When you grow out in like the bush or like on a nettle slide somewhere far away in the mountains, like if you don't have the right varietal, like you just won't get anything out of the off the hillside.
[01:20:07.340 --> 01:20:09.340]  Like it'll just be too cold.
[01:20:10.340 --> 01:20:16.340]  So either the plant won't progress and it won't make resin, it won't make flavor, it won't make terpenes.
[01:20:16.340 --> 01:20:21.340]  Maybe it won't make terpenes because cold nights don't let terpenes express.
[01:20:22.340 --> 01:20:25.340]  And cold nights come in like September 1st.
[01:20:25.340 --> 01:20:26.340]  Yeah.
[01:20:26.340 --> 01:20:28.340]  In the Kootenays, for sure.
[01:20:28.340 --> 01:20:30.340]  And cold nights, meaning.
[01:20:30.340 --> 01:20:31.340]  But it's weird.
[01:20:31.340 --> 01:20:37.340]  The outdoor varieties of the Kootenays like are British Columbia back in the day from like late 90s, early 2000s.
[01:20:37.340 --> 01:20:40.340]  Like in a way they thrive in the cold.
[01:20:40.340 --> 01:20:42.340]  That Stardog Wookie is super special.
[01:20:42.340 --> 01:20:43.340]  Right on.
[01:20:43.340 --> 01:20:45.340]  That Stardog Wookie is incredible.
[01:20:45.340 --> 01:20:46.340]  And I know there's guys.
[01:20:46.340 --> 01:20:48.340]  It's nice that it came from Bodie too.
[01:20:48.340 --> 01:20:49.340]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:20:49.340 --> 01:20:50.340]  Yeah.
[01:20:50.340 --> 01:20:52.340]  And I know there's guys, there's multiple guys like shout out Humphrey Ashish.
[01:20:52.340 --> 01:20:57.340]  He's also working with the Stardog and had some incredible stuff going with it.
[01:20:57.340 --> 01:20:59.340]  So it's a special plant.
[01:20:59.340 --> 01:21:05.340]  And I know that like a lot of stuff that Bodie has, but that and the 88 G13 hash plant.
[01:21:05.340 --> 01:21:06.340]  Yeah, we had that one.
[01:21:06.340 --> 01:21:07.340]  We grew that one.
[01:21:07.340 --> 01:21:08.340]  Super.
[01:21:08.340 --> 01:21:09.340]  Foolish.
[01:21:09.340 --> 01:21:17.340]  We had this one of those hash plant G13s that was super large bud, super airy with all the red hairs going up it.
[01:21:17.340 --> 01:21:20.340]  And it was just such an interesting flavor.
[01:21:22.340 --> 01:21:25.340]  And yeah, we had a bunch of varieties.
[01:21:25.340 --> 01:21:27.340]  Bodie gives us amazing seeds.
[01:21:27.340 --> 01:21:28.340]  We love you, Bodie.
[01:21:28.340 --> 01:21:41.340]  And the whole Nyrka seed trust, if everyone should know about the Nyrka seed trust, which is a lot of his land-raised varieties that he's collected from all over the years in different places and stuff, along with the family and stuff that he travels with and stuff.
[01:21:41.340 --> 01:21:42.340]  Big up, Bodie.
[01:21:44.340 --> 01:21:45.340]  Love it.
[01:21:45.340 --> 01:21:46.340]  Love it.
[01:21:47.340 --> 01:21:48.340]  Anyway.
[01:21:48.340 --> 01:21:49.340]  Yeah.
[01:21:49.340 --> 01:21:50.340]  Yeah.
[01:21:50.340 --> 01:21:55.340]  So now we've been blessed to always grow organic.
[01:21:56.340 --> 01:21:59.340]  So Kelly and I are on our 30th year of being together.
[01:21:59.340 --> 01:22:02.340]  So we met in 93, April Fool's Day.
[01:22:02.340 --> 01:22:03.340]  30 years?
[01:22:03.340 --> 01:22:06.340]  April Fool's Day, 1993.
[01:22:06.340 --> 01:22:07.340]  Wow.
[01:22:07.340 --> 01:22:08.340]  Eugene, Oregon.
[01:22:08.340 --> 01:22:09.340]  Wow.
[01:22:09.340 --> 01:22:13.340]  So Kelly's still not graduated from college.
[01:22:13.340 --> 01:22:17.340]  I'm building and learning how to build and all that.
[01:22:17.340 --> 01:22:22.340]  And we're just, we love Grateful Dead.
[01:22:22.340 --> 01:22:24.340]  We love parking lots.
[01:22:25.340 --> 01:22:26.340]  And selling things.
[01:22:27.340 --> 01:22:30.340]  And hacky sack and drumming and drum tower.
[01:22:30.340 --> 01:22:33.340]  I used to be hardcore into foot bag hacky sack.
[01:22:33.340 --> 01:22:34.340]  Oh, yeah.
[01:22:34.340 --> 01:22:39.340]  I went to the world competition in Disneyland one year to compete.
[01:22:39.340 --> 01:22:40.340]  No.
[01:22:40.340 --> 01:22:41.340]  From Represent Canada.
[01:22:41.340 --> 01:22:42.340]  Yeah.
[01:22:42.340 --> 01:22:43.340]  I can't do it.
[01:22:43.340 --> 01:22:45.340]  I'll snap my legs and back in half if I even try at this point.
[01:22:45.340 --> 01:22:46.340]  Really?
[01:22:46.340 --> 01:22:47.340]  Yeah.
[01:22:47.340 --> 01:22:50.340]  So if we bust out a foot bag right now, you're not going to be doing like around the world?
[01:22:50.340 --> 01:22:51.340]  No, there's like, you need shoes.
[01:22:51.340 --> 01:22:53.340]  And I could do around the world for sure.
[01:22:53.340 --> 01:22:54.340]  Okay.
[01:22:54.340 --> 01:22:55.340]  I could do around the world for sure.
[01:22:55.340 --> 01:22:59.340]  But like, yeah.
[01:22:59.340 --> 01:23:02.340]  Just not a 360 around the world back flip?
[01:23:02.340 --> 01:23:04.340]  No, no black back flip.
[01:23:04.340 --> 01:23:05.340]  I could do the other half.
[01:23:05.340 --> 01:23:06.340]  Right.
[01:23:06.340 --> 01:23:07.340]  Pretty reasonably.
[01:23:07.340 --> 01:23:08.340]  That's cool.
[01:23:08.340 --> 01:23:09.340]  Fair enough.
[01:23:09.340 --> 01:23:12.340]  I've always been kind of a person that's like, I can't go half into something.
[01:23:12.340 --> 01:23:14.340]  I have to be all the way.
[01:23:14.340 --> 01:23:17.340]  There's no, there's no one foot in, one foot out.
[01:23:17.340 --> 01:23:21.340]  So it was an in-depth obsession for a period of time.
[01:23:22.340 --> 01:23:33.340]  It was able to, like, I would be able to go busking and, and make my money for the week or the day or pick up my, pick up my ganja and go shred some more and do it again.
[01:23:33.340 --> 01:23:34.340]  Right.
[01:23:34.340 --> 01:23:36.340]  And that's what we used to do, like barter fairs.
[01:23:36.340 --> 01:23:48.340]  So like in the late 80s and early 90s, when we started like kind of coming into the world and like experiencing psychedelics and doing the whole thing, like barter fairs were really cool.
[01:23:48.340 --> 01:23:53.340]  And the Trinity tribal stomp and hay fork in Trinity was really amazing.
[01:23:53.340 --> 01:23:57.340]  Can you break into what, what, what that is a little bit more?
[01:23:57.340 --> 01:23:58.340]  Big love Trinity.
[01:23:58.340 --> 01:23:59.340]  Marcus's daughter's name Trinity.
[01:23:59.340 --> 01:24:00.340]  Big love Trinity.
[01:24:00.340 --> 01:24:04.340]  A barter, a barter sesh, do you call it?
[01:24:04.340 --> 01:24:05.340]  A barter fair.
[01:24:05.340 --> 01:24:06.340]  A barter fair.
[01:24:06.340 --> 01:24:07.340]  I'm not familiar with that term.
[01:24:07.340 --> 01:24:08.340]  Okay.
[01:24:08.340 --> 01:24:13.340]  So, well, rainbow gatherings obviously are awesome and have been happening forever.
[01:24:14.340 --> 01:24:18.340]  And they're like a mid summer, like 4th of July type, you know, thing.
[01:24:18.340 --> 01:24:24.340]  And they're really special and it's no money and it's everyone sharing everything.
[01:24:25.340 --> 01:24:29.340]  And that was like a really important family, the rainbow family forever.
[01:24:29.340 --> 01:24:44.340]  And herbalism and just self-reliance and the first solar and all of the recycling, like really all the most progressive hippie type stuff was like rainbow family and Grateful Dead family.
[01:24:45.340 --> 01:24:49.340]  And whether or not you like Grateful Dead music, the movement was undeniable.
[01:24:49.340 --> 01:25:03.340]  And when you are coming out of like, if you were 16 years old or just coming out of high school and you went to a Grateful Dead show, it was about what was happening in the parking lot and everywhere around the show and the whole entire community that surrounded it.
[01:25:03.340 --> 01:25:07.340]  So, the Dead show was the open market.
[01:25:07.340 --> 01:25:09.340]  And so when people say, oh, I was on tour.
[01:25:09.340 --> 01:25:11.340]  Well, the dead never played the same show.
[01:25:11.340 --> 01:25:12.340]  Right.
[01:25:12.340 --> 01:25:14.340]  They just played a different show, different set list.
[01:25:14.340 --> 01:25:21.340]  So it was interesting always to see the show and everyone writes down the set list and then you trade tapes for free or weren't allowed to sell them.
[01:25:21.340 --> 01:25:22.340]  That was sweet.
[01:25:22.340 --> 01:25:23.340]  Yeah.
[01:25:23.340 --> 01:25:36.340]  And then in the parking lot, you're having this whole like unraveling experience of like what a person is supposed to be, what society is, what we've been given in education, what we've been given in products.
[01:25:37.340 --> 01:25:41.340]  And then you see this whole society of people making their own stuff.
[01:25:41.340 --> 01:26:03.340]  They're makers, they make things, they make their own clothes, we make our own clothes, our own medicine, you know, we're wanting things in our kitchen that don't resonate, bad chemicals, you know, we want to learn about preserving food, we want to trade salsa and seeds and fire ciders and things that we've made throughout the year, right?
[01:26:03.340 --> 01:26:09.340]  From our garden, it's different than the other person's garden, which has different information and different healing properties.
[01:26:09.340 --> 01:26:14.340]  So the Grateful Dead lot was that maker's lot that went everywhere.
[01:26:14.340 --> 01:26:17.340]  And you could go to a different city, three shows at a time.
[01:26:17.340 --> 01:26:21.340]  You go to 16 shows and see like two shows repeated.
[01:26:21.340 --> 01:26:23.340]  That's amazing on a music level.
[01:26:23.340 --> 01:26:24.340]  That's amazing.
[01:26:24.340 --> 01:26:29.340]  And then in the parking lot, like you met all these crazy characters and there was no Internet.
[01:26:29.340 --> 01:26:31.340]  So there was no cell phones.
[01:26:31.340 --> 01:26:33.340]  We didn't have cell phones or Internet at the time.
[01:26:33.340 --> 01:26:36.340]  So it's meet me at the disco bus.
[01:26:36.340 --> 01:26:42.340]  So did you get to hang out with Bob Snodgrass and the Glassblowers?
[01:26:42.340 --> 01:26:44.340]  Was that at the same general time?
[01:26:44.340 --> 01:26:45.340]  We did.
[01:26:45.340 --> 01:26:46.340]  We did.
[01:26:46.340 --> 01:27:00.340]  So Bob Snodgrass' grandfather, Bob and Marie, moved to Eugene in the late 80s and in the early 90s and became like Eugene family Glassblowers, right?
[01:27:00.340 --> 01:27:14.340]  And Bob Snodgrass was so amazing because he learned how to fuse, in a semi-accident, learned how to fuse silver and gold into the glass.
[01:27:14.340 --> 01:27:17.340]  And the glass changed colors.
[01:27:17.340 --> 01:27:24.340]  Anyway, and then he's like, oh my God, I could have like just saved this secret and just made a million dollars and no one would know how to do it.
[01:27:24.340 --> 01:27:29.340]  But instead, like spirit of Grateful Dead, spirit of Barter Fair, share everything.
[01:27:29.340 --> 01:27:31.340]  He's like, I'm just going to teach everyone how to do this.
[01:27:31.340 --> 01:27:41.340]  So he became like the godfather of glassblowing because he was so open to teaching everyone like Jerry Garcia and just that style of person, you know?
[01:27:41.340 --> 01:27:46.340]  So, you know, we got into Eugene in the early 90s too.
[01:27:46.340 --> 01:27:50.340]  And we were just more into herbalism and gathering mushrooms.
[01:27:50.340 --> 01:27:54.340]  Like obviously Bob loves mushrooms, Bob and Marie, the whole entire Snodgrass family.
[01:27:55.340 --> 01:27:59.340]  So, you know, then midwifery starts happening.
[01:27:59.340 --> 01:28:02.340]  So Bob's son is also Bob Snodgrass, right?
[01:28:02.340 --> 01:28:04.340]  There's Bobby and Meredith.
[01:28:04.340 --> 01:28:08.340]  Bobby and Meredith with Snodgrass family genetics in Southern Oregon.
[01:28:08.340 --> 01:28:12.340]  And then they have two kids as well, Sierra and Bobby.
[01:28:12.340 --> 01:28:15.340]  So Bobby and Meredith's kids are Sierra and Bobby.
[01:28:15.340 --> 01:28:17.340]  Sierra's together with our son, Sky.
[01:28:17.340 --> 01:28:19.340]  Oh, wow.
[01:28:19.340 --> 01:28:23.340]  Yeah. So Sky and Sierra are together and they just had their first child.
[01:28:23.340 --> 01:28:25.340]  Oh, COVID baby.
[01:28:25.340 --> 01:28:28.340]  On our property, home birth, natural.
[01:28:28.340 --> 01:28:30.340]  Kelly is midwife.
[01:28:30.340 --> 01:28:33.340]  I had one of those. It's a really fucked up story.
[01:28:33.340 --> 01:28:37.340]  Oh, shit. Well, you know what? That means that there's healing possible.
[01:28:37.340 --> 01:28:38.340]  Oh, yeah, man.
[01:28:38.340 --> 01:28:42.340]  We had my firstborn was a huge surprise.
[01:28:42.340 --> 01:28:48.340]  So I was on my way home from work one day and my wife, I sent you a photo.
[01:28:48.340 --> 01:28:53.340]  She's like a petite, 120 pounds on the regular, like just little.
[01:28:53.340 --> 01:28:55.340]  And she was very little at that point in time.
[01:28:55.340 --> 01:28:57.340]  And we had no idea that she was pregnant.
[01:28:57.340 --> 01:29:00.340]  I'm at work and she's gone home early because she didn't feel well.
[01:29:00.340 --> 01:29:03.340]  I get a phone call while I'm on my way home from work.
[01:29:03.340 --> 01:29:06.340]  And she's like, I don't know what's wrong.
[01:29:06.340 --> 01:29:07.340]  She's like that big around.
[01:29:07.340 --> 01:29:10.340]  Like, I don't know what's wrong. I'm in horrendous pain.
[01:29:10.340 --> 01:29:13.340]  I need you to get me to the hospital now. I need to go.
[01:29:13.340 --> 01:29:15.340]  So I like, okay, book it.
[01:29:15.340 --> 01:29:17.340]  I'm going to get home in a hospital.
[01:29:17.340 --> 01:29:21.340]  I'm the executive chef of Black and Blue downtown Vancouver at the time.
[01:29:21.340 --> 01:29:22.340]  I'm running a restaurant.
[01:29:22.340 --> 01:29:26.340]  She's a hostess, you know, so I run home.
[01:29:26.340 --> 01:29:27.340]  I run up the stairs.
[01:29:27.340 --> 01:29:30.340]  I go up because the elevator is taking too long.
[01:29:30.340 --> 01:29:31.340]  And I roll in.
[01:29:31.340 --> 01:29:33.340]  We have a 500 square foot apartment in downtown Vancouver.
[01:29:33.340 --> 01:29:38.340]  And lo and behold, I walk in and I turn to my left and look down.
[01:29:38.340 --> 01:29:45.340]  And in my bathroom, she is on her knees holding our firstborn child that she had just given birth to by herself.
[01:29:45.340 --> 01:29:46.340]  That's sweet.
[01:29:46.340 --> 01:29:47.340]  That's a bathroom.
[01:29:47.340 --> 01:29:48.340]  I mean, was it?
[01:29:48.340 --> 01:29:50.340]  It was beautiful.
[01:29:50.340 --> 01:29:51.340]  She had the birth.
[01:29:51.340 --> 01:29:55.340]  That's the whole entire goal of having a baby.
[01:29:55.340 --> 01:29:56.340]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:29:56.340 --> 01:29:58.340]  Well, we didn't know.
[01:29:58.340 --> 01:29:59.340]  We had no plans.
[01:29:59.340 --> 01:30:02.340]  She didn't even know we should have pregnant when she was giving birth.
[01:30:02.340 --> 01:30:03.340]  Was it early?
[01:30:03.340 --> 01:30:04.340]  Yes, very.
[01:30:04.340 --> 01:30:06.340]  So she was born at about three pounds.
[01:30:06.340 --> 01:30:07.340]  Oh, yeah.
[01:30:07.340 --> 01:30:08.340]  Quite tiny.
[01:30:08.340 --> 01:30:10.340]  Looked like a little old man.
[01:30:10.340 --> 01:30:11.340]  I mean, just absolutely adorable.
[01:30:11.340 --> 01:30:12.340]  For real.
[01:30:12.340 --> 01:30:18.340]  But I remember I looked down and I'm like, I got to like, my mind instantly goes, I got to try and like make this situation easier.
[01:30:18.340 --> 01:30:19.340]  Like this is fucking challenging.
[01:30:19.340 --> 01:30:22.340]  She wouldn't breastfeed or anything right away because she was too small.
[01:30:22.340 --> 01:30:23.340]  Right?
[01:30:23.340 --> 01:30:24.340]  Right.
[01:30:24.340 --> 01:30:25.340]  We're breastfeeding.
[01:30:25.340 --> 01:30:26.340]  We're on our second child now.
[01:30:26.340 --> 01:30:27.340]  Yeah, of course.
[01:30:27.340 --> 01:30:28.340]  Which is great.
[01:30:28.340 --> 01:30:29.340]  Yeah.
[01:30:29.340 --> 01:30:30.340]  It was this shocking moment.
[01:30:30.340 --> 01:30:38.340]  And I'm like, I get down and I'm like, my wife and the daughter that she's holding there, they're just starting to clap.
[01:30:38.340 --> 01:30:40.340]  Like I can see like she's been through hell.
[01:30:40.340 --> 01:30:41.340]  I'm like, I got to scoop them up.
[01:30:41.340 --> 01:30:42.340]  I got a call, 911.
[01:30:42.340 --> 01:30:47.340]  I'm on the phone with them waiting for the ambulance to arrive to figure out what the fuck we're going to do.
[01:30:47.340 --> 01:30:48.340]  And I look down there.
[01:30:48.340 --> 01:30:52.340]  I'm like, I got to like fix like at least make pop some humor or something like this is stressful.
[01:30:52.340 --> 01:30:53.340]  I need to joke.
[01:30:53.340 --> 01:30:56.340]  I'm a terrible human being sometimes when it comes to that.
[01:30:56.340 --> 01:30:57.340]  But my wife loves it.
[01:30:57.340 --> 01:30:58.340]  So it's great.
[01:30:58.340 --> 01:31:01.340]  So I look down at the baby and I look up at her and I look down at the baby and I go, shit.
[01:31:01.340 --> 01:31:03.340]  She goes, oh my God, what's wrong?
[01:31:03.340 --> 01:31:05.340]  I said, oh, it's a girl.
[01:31:05.340 --> 01:31:07.340]  And just to, you know, get a child.
[01:31:07.340 --> 01:31:08.340]  Because you're terrible.
[01:31:08.340 --> 01:31:09.340]  You said that already.
[01:31:09.340 --> 01:31:10.340]  I'm a terrible human being.
[01:31:10.340 --> 01:31:12.340]  I was absolutely horrendous.
[01:31:12.340 --> 01:31:14.340]  And I just, I needed to deal with the situation.
[01:31:14.340 --> 01:31:18.340]  But everybody, everybody in those circumstances does something different.
[01:31:18.340 --> 01:31:19.340]  Most definitely.
[01:31:19.340 --> 01:31:20.340]  Yeah.
[01:31:20.340 --> 01:31:21.340]  There's something.
[01:31:21.340 --> 01:31:22.340]  I'm glad I did something.
[01:31:22.340 --> 01:31:23.340]  The greatest.
[01:31:23.340 --> 01:31:24.340]  Yeah.
[01:31:24.340 --> 01:31:26.340]  It was a long period of time in between.
[01:31:26.340 --> 01:31:27.340]  That's a really big deal.
[01:31:27.340 --> 01:31:28.340]  Yeah.
[01:31:28.340 --> 01:31:32.340]  And you didn't have like a midwife or a community around you of support at the time.
[01:31:32.340 --> 01:31:33.340]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:31:33.340 --> 01:31:34.340]  No clue.
[01:31:34.340 --> 01:31:35.340]  No clue.
[01:31:35.340 --> 01:31:36.340]  That's a really trip.
[01:31:36.340 --> 01:31:37.340]  That's another thing too.
[01:31:37.340 --> 01:31:41.340]  Like not all women are totally in tune with their body.
[01:31:41.340 --> 01:31:43.340]  And that's, I wasn't either.
[01:31:43.340 --> 01:31:44.340]  Men too.
[01:31:44.340 --> 01:31:47.340]  Men are not, obviously not in tune with their body.
[01:31:47.340 --> 01:31:50.340]  And no, we use it as a tool.
[01:31:50.340 --> 01:31:53.340]  It's something that can be used to do things.
[01:31:53.340 --> 01:31:55.340]  Oh, thanks.
[01:31:55.340 --> 01:31:56.340]  Oh.
[01:32:07.340 --> 01:32:11.340]  I think we're getting pretty close to having to pack up though.
[01:32:11.340 --> 01:32:14.340]  We're getting pretty close to the end time there.
[01:32:14.340 --> 01:32:16.340]  Love you family.
[01:32:16.340 --> 01:32:54.560]  Oh my God.
[01:32:54.560 --> 01:32:55.560]  It's Santa Claus again.
[01:32:55.560 --> 01:32:59.560]  Hi sweetie.
[01:32:59.560 --> 01:33:06.560]  No, not me.
[01:33:07.560 --> 01:33:10.560]  Can I hold this?
[01:33:10.560 --> 01:33:11.560]  Yeah, you hold that.
[01:33:11.560 --> 01:33:13.560]  A lot of it you don't want to process.
[01:33:13.560 --> 01:33:15.560]  You just take the best part of it.
[01:33:15.560 --> 01:33:17.560]  It's the truth.
[01:33:17.560 --> 01:33:19.560]  Good show, London.
[01:33:19.560 --> 01:33:20.560]  Good show.
[01:33:20.560 --> 01:33:21.560]  Yeah, brother.
[01:33:21.560 --> 01:33:22.560]  That was great.
[01:33:22.560 --> 01:33:25.560]  I can't hear you, London.
[01:33:25.560 --> 01:33:33.520]  I have a question for them.
[01:33:33.520 --> 01:33:34.520]  Okay.
[01:33:34.520 --> 01:33:35.520]  What's your question?
[01:33:35.520 --> 01:33:37.520]  Just tell them to stop talking.
[01:33:37.520 --> 01:33:39.520]  Yeah, no one's talking.
[01:33:39.520 --> 01:33:41.520]  No one's talking.
[01:33:41.520 --> 01:33:44.520]  Do you hear anyone talking?
[01:33:44.520 --> 01:33:48.520]  They're all looking at you waiting for you to say whatever you're going to say.
[01:33:48.520 --> 01:33:51.520]  You want to show them your science kit?
[01:33:51.520 --> 01:33:52.520]  I'll hold this.
[01:33:52.520 --> 01:33:53.520]  You tell everyone what it is.
[01:33:53.520 --> 01:33:56.520]  So I got a new science kit.
[01:33:56.520 --> 01:34:00.520]  It is so rainbow-y.
[01:34:00.520 --> 01:34:02.520]  It's really rainbow.
[01:34:02.520 --> 01:34:03.520]  Beautiful.
[01:34:03.520 --> 01:34:05.520]  Heck yeah.
[01:34:05.520 --> 01:34:06.520]  And who else is rainbow?
[01:34:06.520 --> 01:34:08.520]  You want to stand up here?
[01:34:09.520 --> 01:34:10.520]  Stand up.
[01:34:10.520 --> 01:34:13.520]  You know who else is rainbow?
[01:34:13.520 --> 01:34:14.520]  Me.
[01:34:14.520 --> 01:34:16.520]  Oh, you're a rainbow.
[01:34:16.520 --> 01:34:17.520]  Girl.
[01:34:17.520 --> 01:34:21.980]  Rainbow.
[01:34:21.980 --> 01:34:25.980]  I may or may not have just come home from gymnastics.
[01:34:25.980 --> 01:34:28.980]  You can't hear you, London.
[01:34:28.980 --> 01:34:29.980]  Me.
[01:34:29.980 --> 01:34:30.980]  I'm a rainbow.
[01:34:30.980 --> 01:34:33.980]  You guys are rainbow.
[01:34:33.980 --> 01:34:34.980]  Hello, everyone.
[01:34:34.980 --> 01:34:37.980]  And I am a rainbow.
[01:34:37.980 --> 01:34:39.980]  Valentina's not done with you guys.
[01:34:39.980 --> 01:34:40.980]  She has more to say.
[01:34:40.980 --> 01:34:41.980]  Okay.
[01:34:41.980 --> 01:34:42.980]  Where are you going?
[01:34:42.980 --> 01:34:46.980]  I have a rainbow today.
[01:34:46.980 --> 01:34:48.980]  I'm wearing a rainbow suit today.
[01:34:48.980 --> 01:34:57.980]  And Peter and Baby Guy have more to say.
[01:34:57.980 --> 01:34:59.980]  And I just said that.
[01:35:02.980 --> 01:35:04.980]  Do you know that Ken's a really good listener?
[01:35:05.980 --> 01:35:08.980]  And he would love to listen to you talk for a good hour or so.
[01:35:08.980 --> 01:35:12.980]  Do you think you have an hour of pure monologue in you?
[01:35:12.980 --> 01:35:14.980]  Who, who, who, what do you say?
[01:35:14.980 --> 01:35:15.980]  Who's Ken?
[01:35:15.980 --> 01:35:16.980]  That's Ken.
[01:35:16.980 --> 01:35:17.980]  Well, sorry, not Ken.
[01:35:17.980 --> 01:35:18.980]  Santa Claus.
[01:35:18.980 --> 01:35:20.980]  Hello.
[01:35:20.980 --> 01:35:22.980]  I love that rainbow outfit.
[01:35:22.980 --> 01:35:24.980]  It's beautiful.
[01:35:24.980 --> 01:35:25.980]  Yeah.
[01:35:25.980 --> 01:35:27.980]  So what kind of, do you do somersaults in that?
[01:35:27.980 --> 01:35:30.980]  I did somersaults.
[01:35:30.980 --> 01:35:31.980]  You did?
[01:35:31.980 --> 01:35:32.980]  Wow.
[01:35:33.980 --> 01:35:35.980]  You are big on the somersaults.
[01:35:35.980 --> 01:35:41.980]  Actually, I am a somersault expert.
[01:35:41.980 --> 01:35:42.980]  You are.
[01:35:42.980 --> 01:35:43.980]  Oh, I love it.
[01:35:43.980 --> 01:35:47.980]  You are an expert in the art of the somersault.
[01:35:47.980 --> 01:35:50.980]  Yeah, Gemma's an expert at.
[01:35:50.980 --> 01:35:51.980]  Cartwheels.
[01:35:51.980 --> 01:35:53.980]  Yeah, and handstands.
[01:35:53.980 --> 01:35:54.980]  And handstands, yeah.
[01:35:54.980 --> 01:35:55.980]  Yes.
[01:35:55.980 --> 01:35:57.980]  And you are an expert in somersaults.
[01:35:57.980 --> 01:35:59.980]  Well, I did handstand at my dad's somersault.
[01:35:59.980 --> 01:36:01.980]  Yeah, we still don't hear you.
[01:36:01.980 --> 01:36:02.980]  Oh, you're muted.
[01:36:02.980 --> 01:36:04.980]  Unmute yourself, that's why.
[01:36:04.980 --> 01:36:06.980]  Who is muted?
[01:36:06.980 --> 01:36:08.980]  I know, we don't hear you anyway.
[01:36:08.980 --> 01:36:10.980]  Who's mute?
[01:36:10.980 --> 01:36:13.980]  I can hear background, but we can't hear your clear voice.
[01:36:13.980 --> 01:36:15.980]  What about, what about now?
[01:36:15.980 --> 01:36:16.980]  What about now, guys?
[01:36:16.980 --> 01:36:17.980]  Can you hear me now?
[01:36:17.980 --> 01:36:18.980]  Yeah, I can hear you now.
[01:36:18.980 --> 01:36:20.980]  ASMR.
[01:36:20.980 --> 01:36:22.980]  Hi, guys.
[01:36:22.980 --> 01:36:24.980]  Can you hear me nicely, very closely right now?
[01:36:24.980 --> 01:36:25.980]  Ba-ba.
[01:36:25.980 --> 01:36:26.980]  Ba-ba.
[01:36:26.980 --> 01:36:28.980]  Can you hear me?
[01:36:28.980 --> 01:36:29.980]  Baby Ken.
[01:36:29.980 --> 01:36:31.980]  I can hear you.
[01:36:31.980 --> 01:36:33.980]  Have you been listening to Valentina?
[01:36:33.980 --> 01:36:35.980]  Yes, I have.
[01:36:35.980 --> 01:36:37.980]  I've been able to hear it the whole time.
[01:36:37.980 --> 01:36:39.980]  Can you guys hear me all right now?
[01:36:39.980 --> 01:36:40.980]  We can hear you.
[01:36:40.980 --> 01:36:41.980]  Can you hear him?
[01:36:41.980 --> 01:36:42.980]  Yeah.
[01:36:42.980 --> 01:36:43.980]  Awesome.
[01:36:43.980 --> 01:36:51.980]  So, we got to slowly start packing this up, because there's a lot of stuff here, and we have to be out at a certain time out of this specific position.
[01:36:52.980 --> 01:37:04.980]  So, we're going to wind it down and finish off today, and maybe do some, we'll see if we have a couple, if I can carve out a small spot a little bit later to do another one, but we'll play it a little bit by ear and see kind of what happens.
[01:37:04.980 --> 01:37:05.980]  Did you guys like the show?
[01:37:05.980 --> 01:37:06.980]  What did you think?
[01:37:06.980 --> 01:37:07.980]  We did.
[01:37:07.980 --> 01:37:08.980]  So, should we shut it down?
[01:37:08.980 --> 01:37:15.980]  Yeah, I think we'll shut it down for now, and I'll kind of pop back in in a little bit, if we can.
[01:37:15.980 --> 01:37:17.980]  I'll show you guys a message if there's a possibility.
[01:37:17.980 --> 01:37:20.980]  Sounds good.
[01:37:21.980 --> 01:37:25.980]  I can't thank you guys enough for your support during the last three days.
[01:37:25.980 --> 01:37:36.980]  If we don't have a stream a little bit later, you guys made this happen, and I cannot thank you all enough for your time and help and support in doing this, and everybody that's been listening to it has been awesome.
[01:37:36.980 --> 01:37:37.980]  Thank you guys.
[01:37:37.980 --> 01:37:39.980]  You guys rock.
[01:37:39.980 --> 01:37:42.980]  This is the first time we met, Ken, and you just roll up and help me the fuck out.
[01:37:42.980 --> 01:37:43.980]  I fucking love it.
[01:37:43.980 --> 01:37:44.980]  You're awesome.
[01:37:44.980 --> 01:37:47.980]  I got to send you a couple packs of seeds for sure.
[01:37:48.980 --> 01:37:50.980]  Halfway, buddy, is Blue River.
[01:37:50.980 --> 01:37:52.980]  Blue River.
[01:37:52.980 --> 01:37:53.980]  There we go.
[01:37:53.980 --> 01:37:59.980]  That's where we're doing the BCFCFFCP barbecue.
[01:37:59.980 --> 01:38:00.980]  Is that what's happening?
[01:38:00.980 --> 01:38:06.980]  We'll go Blue River and then go over to Dragonfly Earth Medicine and have a big old barbecue.
[01:38:06.980 --> 01:38:10.980]  They're a little bit south of Blue River by like eight or nine hours.
[01:38:12.980 --> 01:38:14.980]  Well, you're up north in Calgary.
[01:38:15.980 --> 01:38:19.980]  I totally lost a whole jar of weed last night.
[01:38:19.980 --> 01:38:27.980]  Like a good ounce and a half of weed is just traveling around somewhere in this conference right now.
[01:38:27.980 --> 01:38:29.980]  Don't be sitting here doing it, though.
[01:38:29.980 --> 01:38:30.980]  I'm telling you.
[01:38:30.980 --> 01:38:31.980]  Shut up.
[01:38:31.980 --> 01:38:32.980]  What?
[01:38:32.980 --> 01:38:36.980]  I'm pumped because it's full of seeds, so at least I got seeded weed.
[01:38:36.980 --> 01:38:38.980]  Yeah, I don't doubt it.
[01:38:38.980 --> 01:38:40.980]  It's beautiful.
[01:38:40.980 --> 01:38:41.980]  Thanks again, everybody.
[01:38:41.980 --> 01:38:46.980]  I appreciate you all, and I am going to be out of here and end the broadcast right now.
[01:38:46.980 --> 01:38:50.980]  Thanks again, and again, this is London at the BC Craft Cannabis Conference.
[01:38:50.980 --> 01:38:51.980]  Bye, guys.
[01:38:51.980 --> 01:38:52.980]  Bye, Canadians.
[01:38:52.980 --> 01:38:53.980]  Bye.
[01:38:53.980 --> 01:38:55.980]  We salute you.
