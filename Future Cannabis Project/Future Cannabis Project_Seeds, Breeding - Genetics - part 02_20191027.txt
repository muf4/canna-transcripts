[00:00.000 --> 00:10.910]  2013 I think or 12.
[00:10.910 --> 00:11.910]  In Holland?
[00:11.910 --> 00:12.910]  Yeah.
[00:12.910 --> 00:14.390]  Back when we could still do stuff in Amsterdam?
[00:14.390 --> 00:16.390]  Back when High Times was really cool.
[00:16.390 --> 00:19.430]  Back when it was actually fun in Holland?
[00:19.430 --> 00:20.430]  A long time ago?
[00:20.430 --> 00:21.430]  Yeah.
[00:21.430 --> 00:23.890]  So I think the first year we met was 2012.
[00:23.890 --> 00:26.430]  We had booths across from each other at High Times.
[00:26.430 --> 00:31.150]  Swerve had the biggest, biggest, amazing, crazy booth with like 30 people working it
[00:31.310 --> 00:36.150]  And Loud Seeds was this little booth right across from it with I think four of us.
[00:36.150 --> 00:39.310]  And they had a microphone, they had Hap on the microphone back in the day.
[00:39.310 --> 00:40.310]  Where was that?
[00:40.310 --> 00:41.310]  Here?
[00:41.310 --> 00:42.310]  That was in Amsterdam?
[00:42.310 --> 00:43.550]  Yeah, you had a big ass booth over there.
[00:43.550 --> 00:44.550]  It wasn't the Milk Vague?
[00:44.550 --> 00:49.950]  No, it was the one that was outside the city a little ways.
[00:49.950 --> 00:50.950]  Power Zone?
[00:50.950 --> 00:51.950]  Yeah.
[00:51.950 --> 00:52.950]  Power Zone.
[00:52.950 --> 00:54.910]  That was a cool venue.
[00:54.910 --> 00:57.470]  So we've sat on panels before.
[00:57.470 --> 00:58.630]  We hung out in Amsterdam.
[00:58.630 --> 01:03.870]  One time we even hung out in Amsterdam and I was talking to Swerve and he was like, so
[01:03.870 --> 01:06.590]  I heard someone was saying you talk shit about me.
[01:06.590 --> 01:08.830]  And I literally got a text at the same exact time.
[01:08.830 --> 01:13.590]  It was like, I heard Swerve's pissed at you and fucking he's talking shit about you.
[01:13.590 --> 01:17.590]  And it's like, that kind of stuff went on back in the day a lot.
[01:17.590 --> 01:20.510]  The drama from that was like the early days of Instagram.
[01:20.510 --> 01:21.510]  Right?
[01:21.510 --> 01:22.510]  High school drama.
[01:22.510 --> 01:26.430]  It was even more crazy than high school drama.
[01:26.430 --> 01:27.430]  The marijuana industry.
[01:27.550 --> 01:29.350]  A lot of guys acting like kids.
[01:29.350 --> 01:34.430]  Isn't it funny though how more people took offense to stuff like that than actually worrying
[01:34.430 --> 01:38.070]  about the simple fact of we're doing something extremely illegal and we have to worry about
[01:38.070 --> 01:42.070]  the cops, but we're more worried about the other person that was like, hey, your cuts
[01:42.070 --> 01:43.070]  are really bad.
[01:43.070 --> 01:44.070]  Really?
[01:44.070 --> 01:48.630]  You're worried about the cuts or the seeds, but you're not worried about the fact that
[01:48.630 --> 01:53.710]  everything we do is 100% illegal and we're actually breaking the law to do this?
[01:53.710 --> 01:54.710]  Yeah.
[01:54.710 --> 01:58.350]  That's a weird thought now that I think about it.
[01:58.350 --> 02:00.470]  How lucky the modern day grower is.
[02:00.470 --> 02:01.470]  Right?
[02:01.470 --> 02:02.470]  The modern day generation.
[02:02.470 --> 02:06.750]  They don't even have to experience the stuff we had to get to this point.
[02:06.750 --> 02:09.790]  It was like bizarro world in some ways back then too.
[02:09.790 --> 02:10.790]  I know.
[02:10.790 --> 02:13.990]  It's kind of wild to see like you guys were talking, how you have like, you know, some
[02:13.990 --> 02:17.750]  of the, like I was saying, some of those people that are placing the orders and you're like,
[02:17.750 --> 02:20.670]  oh yeah, we need a hundred thousand seeds or we need a million seeds.
[02:20.670 --> 02:22.670]  And it's like, wait a second, a million.
[02:22.670 --> 02:24.390]  Are you going to grow all those seeds?
[02:25.070 --> 02:27.270]  Yeah, we've got a land and we're going to grow all that.
[02:27.270 --> 02:28.750]  And you're like, wait a second here.
[02:28.750 --> 02:29.750]  Yeah.
[02:29.750 --> 02:31.390]  I mean, some of these companies are stockpiling seeds.
[02:31.390 --> 02:37.470]  I heard a specific company bought 5 million auto flower seeds this year.
[02:37.470 --> 02:39.310]  And then I was like, they must have a lot of land.
[02:39.310 --> 02:40.310]  It's going to be crazy.
[02:40.310 --> 02:41.310]  We got to get in on it.
[02:41.310 --> 02:42.310]  Get to sell some seeds.
[02:42.310 --> 02:43.310]  Yeah.
[02:43.310 --> 02:45.150]  And it turns out that they're stockpiling those seeds.
[02:45.150 --> 02:49.270]  It's not like they're, they're burning through that every year.
[02:49.270 --> 02:53.230]  So I think big companies are getting ready to go online and they want to have stockpile
[02:53.310 --> 02:55.830]  and they have tons of money.
[02:55.830 --> 02:57.430]  That was never a thing back in the day.
[02:57.430 --> 03:00.150]  A million seeds, like maybe 50,000 seeds.
[03:00.150 --> 03:01.150]  If you're lucky.
[03:01.150 --> 03:03.150]  A kilo of seeds was like a big deal.
[03:03.150 --> 03:04.150]  Yeah.
[03:04.150 --> 03:07.310]  You get a kilo of seeds, you're like, yeah, 33,000 seeds, 40,000 seeds.
[03:07.310 --> 03:08.310]  Hell yeah.
[03:08.310 --> 03:09.310]  Yeah.
[03:09.310 --> 03:10.310]  It's pretty wild.
[03:10.310 --> 03:14.790]  Well, and seeds change, depending on the cultivar, you can have small seeds, you can have big
[03:14.790 --> 03:15.790]  seeds.
[03:15.790 --> 03:27.670]  They can weigh anywhere as small as like 0.012 of a gram to 0.0, yeah, 0.2, 0.25.
[03:27.670 --> 03:29.310]  I've seen some monsters.
[03:29.310 --> 03:33.950]  Think like Ray from Homegrown Natural Wonders, Odie that used to work for Sub.
[03:33.950 --> 03:36.430]  He has these seeds that don't even look like cannabis seeds.
[03:36.430 --> 03:37.430]  They're so big.
[03:37.430 --> 03:39.270]  It's like, and he grows outdoors.
[03:39.270 --> 03:40.270]  Yeah.
[03:40.270 --> 03:43.190]  And it's all indicative to the cowlicks that it was grown in, you know?
[03:43.190 --> 03:44.190]  Yeah.
[03:44.590 --> 03:45.590]  So I did side by side.
[03:45.590 --> 03:50.830]  Like when I first started making seeds again, after my little hiatus, I started in, I had
[03:50.830 --> 03:55.830]  some outdoors and some indoors and the outdoor ones were the same as the indoors, the females.
[03:55.830 --> 04:01.150]  And the seeds that I harvested off them were completely different looking in the sense
[04:01.150 --> 04:03.270]  the outdoor ones were much bigger.
[04:03.270 --> 04:09.190]  And I think it's because of the, like I was using Govita's like 1100 watts.
[04:09.190 --> 04:12.550]  And so because they're so strong, it changes the bud density.
[04:12.550 --> 04:14.790]  And so that puts pressure on the seed so the seed doesn't get as big.
[04:14.790 --> 04:16.190]  Doesn't get anywhere near as big.
[04:16.190 --> 04:20.790]  Doesn't have the chance to spread out and get some roundness or room.
[04:20.790 --> 04:26.670]  So you started working in Amsterdam over 10 years ago, around 10 years ago?
[04:26.670 --> 04:27.670]  Yeah, about 10 years ago.
[04:27.670 --> 04:28.670]  What's up, Odie?
[04:28.670 --> 04:29.670]  How you been?
[04:29.670 --> 04:30.670]  Good.
[04:30.670 --> 04:37.790]  Yeah, I think my first cannabis cup was, my first cannabis cup as a competitor was 2009
[04:37.790 --> 04:38.790]  or 2010.
[04:38.790 --> 04:41.910]  I forget when our first award is.
[04:42.270 --> 04:44.270]  I think our first award is from 2011.
[04:44.270 --> 04:46.270]  Is that at the Power Zone?
[04:46.270 --> 04:48.270]  Yeah, we were just talking about how it was in the Power Zone.
[04:48.270 --> 04:50.950]  The good old days of the Power Zone.
[04:50.950 --> 04:54.710]  Before we had that awesome raid at that beautiful tennis court.
[04:54.710 --> 04:56.350]  That was the last one.
[04:56.350 --> 05:01.350]  That was, it wasn't the official last one for me, but it was my last one for a while.
[05:01.350 --> 05:02.350]  And then I think the back was...
[05:02.350 --> 05:03.350]  That was an adventure.
[05:03.350 --> 05:06.430]  It's nothing like being raided by Dutch police.
[05:06.430 --> 05:09.150]  And then they arrested Mila out of all people.
[05:09.750 --> 05:12.750]  The Aryan bailed Mila out of jail for that.
[05:12.750 --> 05:14.750]  Well, because she was doing demonstration, right?
[05:14.750 --> 05:15.750]  Right.
[05:15.750 --> 05:16.750]  She was in the middle of a demonstration.
[05:16.750 --> 05:17.750]  Classic.
[05:17.750 --> 05:18.750]  That was a good time.
[05:18.750 --> 05:19.750]  That was an adventure.
[05:19.750 --> 05:25.190]  The changing of the guard, so to speak, from when they went from like sort of chill and
[05:25.190 --> 05:28.390]  relaxed over in Holland to super conservative.
[05:28.390 --> 05:29.830]  Like 2012 was cool.
[05:29.830 --> 05:33.830]  That was like the last year of like Steve Hager and the Temple Dragons being part of
[05:33.830 --> 05:34.830]  it.
[05:34.830 --> 05:38.430]  Yeah, that was a sort of bittersweet, I wouldn't say bittersweet moment there.
[05:38.710 --> 05:39.710]  Was it good or bad?
[05:39.710 --> 05:40.710]  Yeah.
[05:40.710 --> 05:44.270]  The thing about the Cups back then, which was really cool in my opinion, was that it
[05:44.270 --> 05:45.270]  was every year.
[05:45.270 --> 05:48.190]  And so you had a whole year to kind of gear up for it.
[05:48.190 --> 05:49.190]  But never three months.
[05:49.190 --> 05:53.190]  And when it happened, it was really cool, but it was also still kind of hokey.
[05:53.190 --> 05:58.390]  But that hokeyness came through as sort of like authentic.
[05:58.390 --> 06:04.470]  And then now maybe they're more efficient as far as like in more people, et cetera,
[06:04.470 --> 06:05.470]  et cetera.
[06:05.510 --> 06:08.110]  You have so many of them and you saturate your market.
[06:08.110 --> 06:09.790]  It's like how many Cups can you really go to?
[06:09.790 --> 06:13.110]  And as a company, it's really hard to pick and choose.
[06:13.110 --> 06:17.070]  I mean, you have the nightmare to think about every show, is it going to be a winner or
[06:17.070 --> 06:18.070]  a loser?
[06:18.070 --> 06:19.070]  Is it a winner?
[06:19.070 --> 06:20.070]  Is it a loser?
[06:20.070 --> 06:23.470]  And there's more losers than winners these days at these shows because we've saturated.
[06:23.470 --> 06:26.430]  Well, they're doing Cups every other week.
[06:26.430 --> 06:27.430]  Cash grabs.
[06:27.430 --> 06:29.350]  And they're doing it for like one day events.
[06:29.350 --> 06:31.190]  I mean, Detroit, one day event.
[06:31.190 --> 06:32.870]  Coming in Portland, one day event.
[06:32.870 --> 06:34.430]  Colorado, 420 I think.
[06:34.430 --> 06:37.590]  Well, the Portland one, the Portland one is just an award show.
[06:37.590 --> 06:38.590]  It's not even an event.
[06:38.590 --> 06:39.830]  It's technically just an award show.
[06:39.830 --> 06:42.310]  They're just like, hey, give us your weed and your money.
[06:42.310 --> 06:43.310]  Give us your $1,100 for entries.
[06:43.310 --> 06:44.710]  They're like, give us your money and your weed.
[06:44.710 --> 06:47.390]  There's no show so you don't get $500 entries.
[06:47.390 --> 06:49.710]  We get to charge you the full price.
[06:49.710 --> 06:51.990]  And that was the problem is that like...
[06:51.990 --> 06:56.630]  Also because when most people came to Europe, it was a double adventure.
[06:56.630 --> 07:00.350]  Not only were you judging a cannabis cup, but you're actually in another country.
[07:00.350 --> 07:02.270]  And so everybody was pumped up and stuff.
[07:02.430 --> 07:08.150]  But when you drive like Riverside, it's not got the same sort of flair to it.
[07:08.150 --> 07:10.390]  You're like, okay, this is gonna be fucked.
[07:10.390 --> 07:11.390]  There's no parking.
[07:11.390 --> 07:16.870]  Oh, we haven't thought about these crazy lack of basic things.
[07:16.870 --> 07:18.790]  In Oklahoma, it was a disaster.
[07:18.790 --> 07:20.790]  They didn't have water.
[07:20.790 --> 07:23.350]  It was like 107 degrees.
[07:23.350 --> 07:25.030]  Three hour wait.
[07:25.030 --> 07:27.950]  Parking was two miles from the place.
[07:27.950 --> 07:28.950]  People were in wheelchairs.
[07:28.950 --> 07:29.950]  Wheelchair...
[07:30.630 --> 07:31.630]  Yeah, this was just a few months ago.
[07:31.630 --> 07:32.630]  A couple months ago.
[07:32.630 --> 07:34.630]  It was just like...
[07:34.630 --> 07:39.030]  I got stressed out calls from my friends who were like, can you get me in touch with anybody
[07:39.030 --> 07:40.030]  at high times?
[07:40.030 --> 07:41.030]  Because we have no water.
[07:41.030 --> 07:43.270]  And I could hear people like yelling in the background.
[07:43.270 --> 07:48.990]  I was like, oh, dude, it's fire fest going on out there.
[07:48.990 --> 07:51.910]  It was a proper disaster.
[07:51.910 --> 07:58.990]  But I think that the future of that is gonna be back to those 300 to 500 people events
[07:59.030 --> 08:00.030]  that are like...
[08:00.030 --> 08:03.910]  You kind of get to talk to all of them in every hangout instead of a couple thousand
[08:03.910 --> 08:06.270]  people or 10,000 people or 20,000.
[08:06.270 --> 08:07.270]  It just loses...
[08:07.270 --> 08:10.710]  At a certain point, it's impossible to really judge it properly.
[08:10.710 --> 08:15.630]  It was like Denver those two years or three years where there was 100,000 people at the
[08:15.630 --> 08:17.630]  show where it got saturated.
[08:17.630 --> 08:18.630]  And it was...
[08:18.630 --> 08:23.710]  Because I moved to Colorado in 2009 and I was really surprised for the first time in
[08:23.710 --> 08:27.350]  my life I'd actually bet on the fucking right horse.
[08:27.430 --> 08:30.430]  I was like, oh, this place could get legal here.
[08:30.430 --> 08:33.470]  And then all of a sudden, hey, fucking rec weed.
[08:33.470 --> 08:38.710]  All of a sudden we're like, wow, I'm in this spot after being in Amsterdam for so long.
[08:38.710 --> 08:43.190]  But to see how they lost that whole gig due to bad organization.
[08:43.190 --> 08:44.190]  Horrible organization.
[08:44.190 --> 08:46.270]  And like...
[08:46.270 --> 08:49.510]  It's really hard to put 100,000 people anywhere and make them all happy.
[08:49.510 --> 08:50.990]  Yeah, they had no structure to it.
[08:50.990 --> 08:53.590]  But then when you add dabbing to it, it just killed it.
[08:53.590 --> 08:54.590]  That was it.
[08:54.590 --> 08:55.590]  That was like...
[08:55.590 --> 08:56.590]  Not enough tables.
[08:56.830 --> 08:57.830]  Not enough plugs.
[08:57.830 --> 08:58.830]  Not enough tables.
[08:58.830 --> 08:59.830]  Too many people passing out.
[08:59.830 --> 09:00.830]  Not enough ambulances.
[09:00.830 --> 09:01.830]  Not enough water going around.
[09:01.830 --> 09:02.830]  Not enough water.
[09:02.830 --> 09:05.990]  Just like, again, recipe for disaster.
[09:05.990 --> 09:06.990]  High times.
[09:06.990 --> 09:07.990]  Yeah.
[09:07.990 --> 09:08.990]  There you go.
[09:08.990 --> 09:10.550]  But they got in corporate too.
[09:10.550 --> 09:14.830]  And they're getting their ass handed to them when it comes to trying to get an IPO going
[09:14.830 --> 09:17.390]  and trying to think that it's really...
[09:17.390 --> 09:19.990]  The culture's moving ahead faster than...
[09:19.990 --> 09:20.990]  It's outgrowing.
[09:20.990 --> 09:23.310]  Oh, for sure.
[09:23.430 --> 09:26.670]  They still have the opportunity to change.
[09:26.670 --> 09:27.670]  They have the core.
[09:27.670 --> 09:28.670]  They have the core.
[09:28.670 --> 09:29.670]  They have the core.
[09:29.670 --> 09:30.670]  They have the name.
[09:30.670 --> 09:31.670]  They're lucky.
[09:31.670 --> 09:32.670]  They're lucky to be able to...
[09:32.670 --> 09:33.670]  But it's...
[09:33.670 --> 09:34.670]  I just...
[09:34.670 --> 09:35.670]  The written...
[09:35.670 --> 09:36.670]  The magazines are dead.
[09:36.670 --> 09:37.670]  We know that.
[09:37.670 --> 09:38.670]  I mean, that's like a waste of time.
[09:38.670 --> 09:41.670]  A lot of print media is dead.
[09:41.670 --> 09:42.670]  Yeah.
[09:42.670 --> 09:43.790]  And then when you go...
[09:43.790 --> 09:46.750]  But when you go online with it, it's...
[09:46.750 --> 09:48.750]  You gotta be working nonstop.
[09:48.750 --> 09:50.870]  You have to be working on those events.
[09:50.870 --> 09:55.990]  They don't have a great track record when it comes to taking out permits and doing all
[09:55.990 --> 09:56.990]  these things.
[09:56.990 --> 09:59.910]  And that's one of the things when it comes to doing cannabis-related events.
[09:59.910 --> 10:00.910]  It's hard.
[10:00.910 --> 10:02.670]  I've tried to do it for years.
[10:02.670 --> 10:07.510]  And in Amsterdam, where you think it would be easy, it was even more hard because they
[10:07.510 --> 10:08.990]  actually had rules.
[10:08.990 --> 10:15.030]  So I had one year where I let a Dutch guy do the marketing for me.
[10:15.030 --> 10:21.150]  And he just put out on Reuters, like, we're gonna roll the world's biggest joint.
[10:21.150 --> 10:22.950]  It's gonna be 500 grams.
[10:22.950 --> 10:29.910]  And then within an hour, we had the cops contacting us going like, you know we're gonna be there.
[10:29.910 --> 10:32.070]  And I'm like, yeah, but everybody's gonna put their own weed in.
[10:32.070 --> 10:35.310]  It's like, there's not gonna be one guy with 500 grams.
[10:35.310 --> 10:36.310]  And they were like, no.
[10:36.310 --> 10:40.310]  The minute it all goes into that one joint, it's illegal and we're gonna raid you.
[10:40.310 --> 10:41.310]  So I was like, shit.
[10:41.310 --> 10:43.430]  Why the fuck did you tell them?
[10:43.430 --> 10:49.590]  So you gotta just do it in these situations and then talk about it after.
[10:49.590 --> 10:50.590]  It's my word of advice.
[10:50.590 --> 10:51.590]  Yeah.
[10:51.590 --> 10:56.910]  I mean, that whole system over there, as far as their coffee shops and how they get weed,
[10:56.910 --> 10:58.430]  it's crazy.
[10:58.430 --> 11:03.590]  They're only allowed, what, 500 grams at any one given time in the coffee shop.
[11:03.590 --> 11:09.150]  And most of the coffee shops have networks of guys on scooters that will deliver and
[11:09.150 --> 11:11.190]  run from the cops because they can't get pulled over.
[11:11.190 --> 11:12.190]  They'll get arrested.
[11:12.590 --> 11:14.390]  It's not legal until it gets through the door.
[11:14.390 --> 11:16.350]  It's like a total cat and mouse game.
[11:16.350 --> 11:22.190]  And it's also, the weirder one, which was, they now, because when I was there, it was
[11:22.190 --> 11:25.830]  not legal to sell space cake ever, but people still did.
[11:25.830 --> 11:29.950]  But now they actually have rules, but the rules are you have to be able to see the weed.
[11:29.950 --> 11:32.910]  So it's like, basically you just have to make the worst edibles possible.
[11:32.910 --> 11:36.070]  Like, here you go, make the worst edibles and then you can sell them.
[11:36.070 --> 11:40.630]  As long as people can see little flakes of weed in all of your products, you're like,
[11:41.070 --> 11:42.550]  counterproductive in those things.
[11:43.430 --> 11:43.950]  Yeah.
[11:43.950 --> 11:44.470]  Right.
[11:44.470 --> 11:50.270]  And so the funny thing about Holland though is it's like they're looking at us like
[11:50.270 --> 11:53.470]  with a malice agape, like they just can't believe what's going on.
[11:53.470 --> 11:57.550]  And it's like, no, you guys had 25 years to do this and make this work.
[11:57.550 --> 11:58.550]  Way ahead of everybody.
[11:58.550 --> 12:01.230]  But you just never wanted to acknowledge the grower.
[12:01.230 --> 12:04.830]  And the grower is the most important part of the whole thing.
[12:04.830 --> 12:08.430]  Back in the day, it was pretty much you go to the guy, he grew weed, you got it from
[12:08.430 --> 12:09.630]  him, there you go.
[12:09.710 --> 12:11.470]  Very small window.
[12:11.470 --> 12:16.670]  Now it's you get it from a guy who has 20 guys growing for him and 15 guys trimming
[12:16.670 --> 12:17.190]  for him.
[12:17.190 --> 12:23.630]  And it goes through this UV control after and gets handled seven times before it gets
[12:23.630 --> 12:24.150]  to you.
[12:24.150 --> 12:27.950]  And then you wonder why it's not quite as good as it was when you got it from your
[12:27.950 --> 12:28.630]  friend, you know.
[12:29.510 --> 12:33.110]  So the Dutch have been dealing with that for 20 plus years.
[12:33.110 --> 12:37.230]  That's why the weed was always like, meh, kind of mediocre at best.
[12:37.230 --> 12:41.110]  And occasionally you get a good batch, but that was because it was grown small by
[12:41.110 --> 12:43.430]  somebody, you know, a few pounds here and there.
[12:43.430 --> 12:47.870]  But the minute you got any kind of consistency, but the whole point was they don't
[12:47.870 --> 12:51.950]  recognize growers, it's not legal, so you have to play this small grower, cat and
[12:51.950 --> 12:53.670]  mouse kind of vibe thing.
[12:53.670 --> 13:00.430]  Or just be totally criminal and not give a shit and rent huge warehouses and play
[13:00.430 --> 13:00.990]  that game.
[13:00.990 --> 13:02.750]  But those people don't care.
[13:02.750 --> 13:08.310]  That's your classic no care weed at all, you know, as you can tell.
[13:08.310 --> 13:11.910]  Yeah, the people are bringing stuff up from Morocco and the stuff that came up from
[13:11.910 --> 13:12.550]  Spain.
[13:12.550 --> 13:14.110]  Oh, now Spain is...
[13:14.110 --> 13:17.950]  I mean, if you go to Europe and you don't go to Spain and you're a cannabis lover,
[13:17.950 --> 13:19.470]  then you're out of your mind because that's where it's...
[13:19.470 --> 13:21.550]  Yeah, Barcelona is the new Amsterdam for sure.
[13:21.550 --> 13:21.950]  Oh, yeah.
[13:21.950 --> 13:25.150]  It's the heart and soul of cannabis in Europe is there now.
[13:25.150 --> 13:28.790]  It was in Amsterdam for a long time, but it wasn't, again, it wasn't the Dutch people,
[13:28.790 --> 13:29.630]  it was all the tourists.
[13:29.670 --> 13:32.390]  It's all the same guys in Barcelona that were in Amsterdam.
[13:32.390 --> 13:33.390]  Yeah, and now it's...
[13:33.390 --> 13:34.790]  The weather is nice.
[13:34.790 --> 13:35.390]  Yeah.
[13:35.390 --> 13:36.110]  Food.
[13:36.110 --> 13:36.990]  Food is amazing.
[13:36.990 --> 13:38.190]  Food's actually good.
[13:38.190 --> 13:38.990]  Food is amazing there, yeah.
[13:38.990 --> 13:41.870]  It's not bad in Holland if you go to the right spots, but for the most part...
[13:41.870 --> 13:44.270]  It's everything Holland is not in that sense.
[13:44.270 --> 13:45.870]  Good weather, good food.
[13:45.870 --> 13:47.230]  Yeah, it's bland.
[13:47.230 --> 13:49.310]  People are sort of nice, they're nicer.
[13:49.310 --> 13:51.830]  Right now they're rioting like motherfuckers, so...
[13:51.830 --> 13:53.070]  Oh, yeah, over in Spain?
[13:53.070 --> 13:54.030]  Yeah, it's fun.
[13:54.030 --> 13:55.510]  People dying and stuff, yeah.
[13:55.510 --> 13:58.230]  Well, and that's the thing about they're very passionate.
[13:58.270 --> 13:59.270]  I can see that.
[13:59.270 --> 14:00.270]  Very passionate people.
[14:00.270 --> 14:05.590]  Very passionate, but in general, I mean, definitely when it comes to cannabis, it sits...
[14:05.590 --> 14:07.830]  It has a much more California vibe to it though, too.
[14:07.830 --> 14:09.150]  When you're there, you actually...
[14:09.150 --> 14:12.950]  You can finish outdoor weed there in November, you know, you can't...
[14:12.950 --> 14:14.270]  Colorado is not...
[14:14.270 --> 14:19.510]  Oh, sorry, Amsterdam is not conducive to outdoor growing in almost any way, shape, or form.
[14:19.510 --> 14:21.070]  There's a few pockets of places, but...
[14:21.070 --> 14:23.110]  Yeah, not even in greenhouses out there.
[14:23.110 --> 14:24.950]  Do they really run off of natural light?
[14:24.950 --> 14:27.710]  It's all still supplemental over in Holland.
[14:27.710 --> 14:33.870]  That's where, I mean, literally, indoor growing came from Holland because of the lack of light.
[14:33.870 --> 14:35.590]  But they got all the water in the world.
[14:35.590 --> 14:37.350]  Yeah, that's never been a problem.
[14:37.350 --> 14:39.670]  Got all the water in the world.
[14:39.670 --> 14:46.110]  But, you know, again, like now you see how because we're growing on a scale, it starts to look very similar,
[14:46.110 --> 14:48.790]  like between the way people grow in greenhouses.
[14:48.790 --> 14:52.830]  And like when I was there, I was always butting heads with these guys because I was ignorant
[14:52.830 --> 14:56.710]  and I was thinking like that the American way of growing was the right way.
[14:56.710 --> 15:00.590]  And at that time period, everybody was growing with air-cooled lights.
[15:00.590 --> 15:05.550]  And so you were like putting the lights right down on the plants and growing completely different.
[15:05.550 --> 15:08.350]  And everybody over there had 15 feet in the air.
[15:08.350 --> 15:09.990]  And I was like, oh, you guys are crazy.
[15:09.990 --> 15:10.950]  You don't know what you're doing.
[15:10.950 --> 15:14.750]  And so it was like this whole like change of technology.
[15:14.750 --> 15:21.910]  And now America's adopted the Dutch system and are doing it, I would say, better because Dutch are very efficient.
[15:21.910 --> 15:26.950]  They can do it with less people and always make, they can always cut every corner because they don't give a shit.
[15:26.950 --> 15:30.030]  You know, they'll use a computer, use an automatic thing.
[15:30.030 --> 15:35.230]  Whereas I think we're still kind of, for the most part, trying to like create jobs.
[15:35.230 --> 15:37.350]  We're not trying to automate everything too much.
[15:37.350 --> 15:38.190]  It's getting there.
[15:38.190 --> 15:46.310]  But for the most part, it's like the scale is, I think you still do better when you have more hands on anyway.
[15:46.310 --> 15:49.150]  Automation is great, but you still need people to take care of things.
[15:49.190 --> 15:50.190]  That's just the reality of it.
[15:50.190 --> 15:55.070]  You need to have the human touch, the human hand, the human interaction no matter what.
[15:55.070 --> 16:00.870]  And in my honest opinion, like I said, automation is awesome because it makes things obviously that much more efficient.
[16:00.870 --> 16:03.070]  But the human touch, the human hand.
[16:03.070 --> 16:06.510]  Yeah, well, I think there's things that should be automated and there's things that shouldn't be automated.
[16:06.510 --> 16:07.030]  Yeah, I agree.
[16:07.030 --> 16:07.870]  Like watering.
[16:07.870 --> 16:10.870]  I totally love automated watering.
[16:10.870 --> 16:12.710]  It's the greatest thing ever.
[16:12.710 --> 16:16.470]  But my friends up in Seattle, House of Cultivar, those guys hand water.
[16:16.470 --> 16:19.270]  And it's because for their model, hand watering works.
[16:19.270 --> 16:26.870]  They have 88 different cultivars at any one given time in a 34,000 square foot facility.
[16:26.870 --> 16:28.590]  And that's a lot of hand watering.
[16:28.590 --> 16:31.390]  But I think those type of things should definitely be automated.
[16:31.390 --> 16:33.590]  I feel like you can control it better.
[16:33.590 --> 16:42.230]  And the more you can control your variables when you're growing like large quantities, you know, and also repeating the same results like those things are important.
[16:42.230 --> 16:45.150]  Well, plants appreciate the timing.
[16:45.150 --> 16:45.670]  You know what I mean?
[16:45.950 --> 16:54.390]  You realize when you try to do, like, if you've ever tried to save money by not, like, I don't need a timer.
[16:54.390 --> 16:57.110]  I'll just turn it on and off every day at the right time.
[16:57.110 --> 16:57.910]  You'll never do it.
[16:57.910 --> 17:01.710]  It's like it's always going to be a minute here, a minute there, two minutes here, five minutes here.
[17:01.710 --> 17:05.510]  Like for you to literally get it on the time every day is not happening.
[17:05.510 --> 17:05.710]  Right.
[17:05.710 --> 17:08.670]  So that's a fail.
[17:08.670 --> 17:25.150]  And when it comes to watering, even though you could be consistent, depending on how you're growing, like, it's better to feed them less amounts but on a very consistent schedule and kind of let them go where they need to go and let them, like, instead of trying to baby every single plant.
[17:25.150 --> 17:27.670]  Because, like, my mom's the worst.
[17:27.670 --> 17:30.270]  She, like, picks up every single plant, right, when she's doing it.
[17:30.270 --> 17:39.270]  Like, she'll go in and it takes her two hours to do what takes me, like, a half hour because I'm just kind of like, well, I'll go do it, come back, and if I see I missed a spot or whatever, I'll do it.
[17:39.270 --> 17:45.510]  But she'll, like, go in and pick up every single plant, double check, triple check, and water it just right, perfect.
[17:45.510 --> 17:48.030]  You know, it's not effective time-wise.
[17:48.030 --> 17:48.630]  It's great.
[17:48.630 --> 17:49.390]  They all look great.
[17:49.390 --> 17:52.950]  But that's what you do with your moms and your things that you're not.
[17:52.950 --> 18:08.790]  But when you're doing production, in a way, it's a lot nicer when you can just plug a dripper or, you know, bottom, depending on your system, how you're going to feed it or bottom feed it or, you know, have it on a Dosatron or whatever system you're going to be using.
[18:08.790 --> 18:15.710]  But you notice that, wow, they sure do produce way better when someone else is doing the time.
[18:16.710 --> 18:21.030]  I'm a big fan of, like, for making seeds, I prefer making seeds in a sterile environment.
[18:21.030 --> 18:23.870]  I use cocoa, which is more sterile than soil, obviously.
[18:23.870 --> 18:27.030]  But as far as for smoking, I prefer, like, living soil.
[18:27.030 --> 18:29.670]  You can't beat the taste.
[18:29.670 --> 18:35.230]  Salts are good and they're great for mass production.
[18:35.230 --> 18:36.470]  And there's nothing wrong with it.
[18:36.470 --> 18:42.150]  And for seed salts, using salts as opposed to organics.
[18:42.150 --> 18:44.630]  So, like, GH is pretty much salt-based.
[18:45.150 --> 18:49.310]  HGV, my friends in Arizona are using HGV and they're crushing it.
[18:50.070 --> 18:53.390]  Anything with a G or an H in it seems to be made out of salt these days.
[18:53.390 --> 18:55.390]  Salt is a good company.
[18:55.390 --> 19:00.510]  But, I mean, it is the most effective and it is easy, especially in a Dosatron situation.
[19:00.510 --> 19:04.950]  Like, things like when you're automated, you kind of have to fall into line.
[19:04.950 --> 19:13.510]  You can't, it's very hard to do organic and have it automated beyond, you know, I think even with that.
[19:13.550 --> 19:21.750]  Like, when you're doing living soils and stuff, there's really no point of automating it because your work schedules are a lot lower.
[19:21.750 --> 19:28.390]  Well, Wrigley in Nevada has 40,000 square foot, a 40,000 square foot facility of living soil.
[19:28.390 --> 19:30.430]  So, they've scaled it and that's great for them.
[19:30.430 --> 19:31.670]  I haven't tried the product.
[19:31.670 --> 19:33.670]  They just have, like, soakers in there or something.
[19:33.670 --> 19:34.030]  Yeah.
[19:34.030 --> 19:35.030]  Yeah.
[19:35.030 --> 19:37.390]  And so, I mean, it's an interesting concept.
[19:37.390 --> 19:40.550]  I just, and maybe it's more beneficial for the plants.
[19:40.550 --> 19:41.990]  Even making seeds, maybe it's better.
[19:42.030 --> 19:50.070]  But, in my results, I feel like I've gotten better results from using cocoa with seeds and using, you know, Net FM drippers.
[19:50.070 --> 19:54.070]  And I water several times a day and I keep it real simple.
[19:54.070 --> 19:54.470]  Yeah.
[19:54.470 --> 19:56.070]  Seven times, three minutes maybe.
[19:56.070 --> 19:56.550]  Yeah.
[19:56.550 --> 19:57.590]  Four minutes max.
[19:57.590 --> 19:58.870]  Depending on how big a pot.
[19:58.870 --> 20:03.430]  I've grown in as small as one gallon and 12 plants per 600.
[20:03.430 --> 20:03.910]  Yeah.
[20:03.910 --> 20:05.310]  Just more water.
[20:05.310 --> 20:05.830]  Yeah.
[20:05.830 --> 20:09.630]  You just more water all the time and they dry out.
[20:09.630 --> 20:10.110]  Yeah.
[20:10.110 --> 20:14.430]  So, you ever use the Charcor Biopots?
[20:14.430 --> 20:14.910]  No.
[20:14.910 --> 20:20.550]  So, it's cocoa and they come in these blocks and they have bags and then you hydrate them and they spring up.
[20:20.550 --> 20:21.230]  That's cool.
[20:21.230 --> 20:24.230]  And you can transplant one bag right to the next.
[20:24.230 --> 20:25.230]  So, you can use the...
[20:25.230 --> 20:25.950]  That's convenient.
[20:25.950 --> 20:26.070]  Yeah.
[20:26.070 --> 20:28.310]  The one liter will go in, like, a two gallon.
[20:28.310 --> 20:30.070]  Super easy.
[20:30.070 --> 20:32.190]  And for making seeds, it's super simple because you can...
[20:32.190 --> 20:32.710]  And I like...
[20:32.710 --> 20:34.350]  ...veg in a smaller area.
[20:34.350 --> 20:38.110]  I like from Nick Dro's pyramids.
[20:38.110 --> 20:38.990]  You've seen those, right?
[20:38.990 --> 20:39.430]  Yeah.
[20:39.470 --> 20:40.590]  The pyramid pots.
[20:40.590 --> 20:41.070]  Oh, yeah.
[20:41.070 --> 20:41.390]  Totally.
[20:41.390 --> 20:42.470]  Those are badass.
[20:42.470 --> 20:43.350]  Those are really good.
[20:43.350 --> 20:48.070]  And that's the thing is when you're growing on scale, it's all about consistency.
[20:48.070 --> 20:49.790]  It's about trying to do things.
[20:49.790 --> 20:50.510]  It's...
[20:50.510 --> 20:55.910]  You kind of have to get real boring if you want it because you can't start making, like, adjustments.
[20:55.910 --> 20:58.630]  You have to make everything very linear.
[20:58.630 --> 21:06.070]  You want your lighting schedule to be, like, there's no point of, like, turning bulbs in different directions to try to fill in gaps.
[21:06.070 --> 21:12.190]  I mean, you get all those old ways of thinking, like, we're going to run a couple over this way and a couple over here.
[21:12.190 --> 21:12.910]  And it's like, no, no.
[21:12.910 --> 21:28.910]  Once you start growing anything that's especially custom built and or, you know, when you're talking 40, 50, 60,000 square foot facilities, it's, you know, kind of boring because they all start to become very homogenized.
[21:28.910 --> 21:29.950]  It's all CAD.
[21:29.950 --> 21:30.550]  Exactly.
[21:30.550 --> 21:32.190]  And it's all rolling tables.
[21:32.190 --> 21:32.630]  Yeah.
[21:32.630 --> 21:34.230]  SOPs.
[21:34.230 --> 21:35.590]  SOPs all day.
[21:35.630 --> 21:36.910]  What's your SOP like?
[21:36.910 --> 21:39.070]  Oh, that's 50 pages.
[21:39.070 --> 21:40.630]  Right.
[21:40.630 --> 21:42.990]  And, you know, you start to see it when you tour all these facilities.
[21:42.990 --> 21:44.070]  You start to go, like, yep.
[21:44.070 --> 21:45.950]  It's, like, unfortunate.
[21:45.950 --> 21:54.630]  Like, my thing that I loved back in the day, especially when people were a little bit more creative, was that you would find, like, a nugget at every grove.
[21:54.630 --> 22:01.750]  Like, there'd be, like, one guy who just, you know, filled reservoirs every day for, like, seven years.
[22:01.750 --> 22:05.470]  And he came up with the smartest way to, like, never fuck up.
[22:05.470 --> 22:09.070]  And, like, it's just, like, oh, yeah, I went to Home Depot and I got this thing and I put it in.
[22:09.070 --> 22:11.230]  You know, like, oh, my God, genius.
[22:11.230 --> 22:13.030]  It's because those people did it every day.
[22:13.030 --> 22:13.550]  You know what I mean?
[22:13.550 --> 22:22.110]  And now the problem, it takes a lot of that creativity away because if they're furtigating with Dosatron, you pretty much have them under contract.
[22:22.150 --> 22:25.750]  Or you have Argus or you have another one of these big companies.
[22:25.750 --> 22:28.030]  And then you're a slave to that.
[22:28.030 --> 22:29.590]  It's like driving a Tesla.
[22:29.590 --> 22:31.590]  It's like, you're not going to go home and fix that thing.
[22:31.590 --> 22:32.710]  I'm sorry.
[22:32.710 --> 22:36.710]  If your car bricks up, call Tesla and they'll come in and tow it.
[22:36.710 --> 22:39.070]  You know, and that's kind of where a lot of the grows are getting.
[22:39.070 --> 22:39.990]  See you guys.
[22:39.990 --> 22:40.990]  Thanks, man.
[22:40.990 --> 22:46.270]  That's where a lot of the grows are kind of going towards where it's just literally everything is under contract.
[22:46.270 --> 22:59.790]  Plus people are, as you noticed, the next few years of this industry are going to be a lot of litigation because a lot of people are putting a lot of energy and money into something and then figuring out that it's totally wrong.
[22:59.790 --> 23:01.270]  That's just not right.
[23:01.270 --> 23:02.390]  Like, yeah, you don't.
[23:02.390 --> 23:04.870]  That was a big waste of, oh, you mean we have to tear it out?
[23:04.870 --> 23:07.510]  And someone's heads are going to roll.
[23:07.510 --> 23:09.190]  You know, that's all you see now in this industry.
[23:09.190 --> 23:13.670]  So I think the big winners are going to be lawyers in the next few years.
[23:13.830 --> 23:16.670]  Yeah, I mean, you guys were talking about earlier with all the hemp stuff.
[23:16.670 --> 23:18.710]  It's like a couple of friends of mine, even.
[23:18.710 --> 23:28.510]  I think they had, I think it was about 15 acres, thousands of pounds that this state of Kentucky had to completely just bulldoze.
[23:28.510 --> 23:29.390]  Came in hot.
[23:29.390 --> 23:29.910]  Yeah.
[23:29.910 --> 23:31.790]  They paid a dollar a seed straight up.
[23:31.790 --> 23:32.390]  Doesn't matter.
[23:32.390 --> 23:34.790]  Hundred thousand seeds, two hundred thousand seeds, a buck a seed.
[23:34.790 --> 23:36.270]  And it's like, these are hemp seeds we're talking about.
[23:36.270 --> 23:38.270]  And people complain about us selling TH seeds.
[23:38.270 --> 23:38.670]  Yeah.
[23:38.670 --> 23:39.830]  You know, T8.
[23:39.830 --> 23:41.990]  No offense, but no pun.
[23:42.030 --> 23:46.950]  But THC seeds, you know, and that's the situation.
[23:46.950 --> 23:54.070]  Or it's kind of flabbergasting to see where, yeah, they put six, seven hundred thousand dollars in from a company who said, oh, no, this is actually this.
[23:54.070 --> 23:54.870]  Here's a COA.
[23:54.870 --> 23:56.470]  And then their COA was full of shit.
[23:56.470 --> 23:59.950]  Well, there was a point in time last year where.
[23:59.950 --> 24:00.470]  It was that one seed they tested clean.
[24:00.470 --> 24:03.310]  It was that one plant that they tested that happened to be the right one.
[24:03.310 --> 24:12.990]  Yeah, there was a point in time last year when if you put in like a COA into like Google search, there was like, bam, there'd be like 50 of them.
[24:12.990 --> 24:13.270]  Right.
[24:13.270 --> 24:17.150]  And then you'd recognize like you'd be like, oh, I just saw that one yesterday.
[24:17.150 --> 24:21.510]  Like literally, it's like someone be in the parking lot, you know, make a COA real quick.
[24:21.510 --> 24:29.150]  And then so the same COAs were going around for nine different types of seed that were nothing to do with those COAs at all.
[24:29.150 --> 24:30.510]  You know, same thing with SOPs.
[24:30.510 --> 24:32.030]  Like the year ago, the SOPs.
[24:32.030 --> 24:32.710]  Three letters.
[24:32.710 --> 24:34.350]  Don't trust three letter things.
[24:34.350 --> 24:35.230]  They're bad.
[24:35.230 --> 24:36.550]  Everyone's like boilerplate.
[24:36.550 --> 24:40.470]  Once it's been broken down into three letters, it's usually a bad situation.
[24:40.470 --> 24:41.310]  As you know.
[24:41.310 --> 24:41.870]  I do know.
[24:41.870 --> 24:43.430]  Yeah, there you go.
[24:43.430 --> 24:44.350]  Come on, James.
[24:44.350 --> 24:44.870]  Jump in there.
[24:44.870 --> 24:45.430]  Jump in.
[24:45.430 --> 24:46.710]  I see you, Jim.
[24:46.710 --> 24:48.390]  SOPs, we're talking your language now.
[24:48.390 --> 24:49.390]  We're talking.
[24:49.390 --> 24:52.550]  I actually erased all our SOPs and now we use a program called Trainial.
[24:52.550 --> 24:54.150]  It's a lot better.
[24:54.150 --> 24:54.950]  Wouldn't it be amazing?
[24:54.990 --> 25:04.310]  You are in the crazy world of SEOs and internet positioning and all that.
[25:04.310 --> 25:08.190]  I mean, it's one of those things that I don't really feel very sorry.
[25:08.190 --> 25:12.870]  I do feel sorry, but I don't ever like envy anybody's position because I know how hard that is.
[25:12.870 --> 25:15.870]  It's like it's the bane of my existence, websites.
[25:15.870 --> 25:20.630]  It's just trying to keep them up, trying to keep them going, working.
[25:20.670 --> 25:27.990]  Security-wise, making sure we're secure because we get randomly 100,000 texts a day.
[25:27.990 --> 25:29.550]  I mean, you got closed.
[25:29.550 --> 25:32.470]  Your account got shut down more times.
[25:32.470 --> 25:33.110]  Like probably like...
[25:33.110 --> 25:35.270]  17 times Instagram shut down.
[25:35.270 --> 25:35.870]  Yeah.
[25:35.870 --> 25:39.230]  Now we have the most boring Instagram account ever.
[25:39.230 --> 25:40.390]  It just...
[25:40.390 --> 25:44.310]  As soon as we put something up, we take it down 24 hours because that's the only way we can keep it up.
[25:44.310 --> 25:48.230]  Every time we get to 10,000, 20,000, boom, it shut us down 17 times.
[25:48.270 --> 25:51.350]  Like we were running out of names to name shit.
[25:51.350 --> 25:54.150]  We were like, what else do you call yourself?
[25:54.150 --> 25:55.350]  Right.
[25:55.350 --> 25:56.110]  People just...
[25:56.110 --> 25:57.390]  They would just report us.
[25:57.390 --> 26:00.310]  And that's like the genocide of cannabis, if you will.
[26:00.310 --> 26:07.310]  They keep cutting down everybody's YouTube accounts and all these Instagram accounts.
[26:07.310 --> 26:09.270]  People will forget about what people went through.
[26:09.270 --> 26:14.110]  And I don't know how many of you guys have all your pictures printed out and have hard copies of them,
[26:14.110 --> 26:18.190]  but majority of them up there on Instagram, if they delete your account, that's your history.
[26:18.190 --> 26:20.990]  People don't remember what people had to go through, what they did.
[26:20.990 --> 26:27.110]  And it's like when ICMAG got deleted, everybody's GrowTips that they did, all that history all went away.
[26:27.110 --> 26:29.870]  So we've got a form opened up on CTO now.
[26:29.870 --> 26:32.790]  So all my breeders have the ability to go in there.
[26:32.790 --> 26:35.470]  They have a form that's held on its own separate server.
[26:35.470 --> 26:36.630]  It's hosted in Amsterdam.
[26:36.630 --> 26:38.590]  It's pretty secure.
[26:38.590 --> 26:40.670]  But everybody's able to use it.
[26:40.670 --> 26:41.910]  So you have your own room.
[26:41.910 --> 26:43.470]  You can do the facts.
[26:43.470 --> 26:44.830]  You can ask him about his strains.
[26:44.830 --> 26:48.550]  You can ask, talk to the breeder one-on-one and get the information from them.
[26:48.550 --> 26:50.790]  Is it hosted by XS for All by any chance?
[26:50.790 --> 26:51.630]  Yes, it is.
[26:51.630 --> 26:52.430]  Is it?
[26:52.430 --> 26:53.070]  I don't know.
[26:53.070 --> 26:53.830]  Okay.
[26:53.830 --> 26:56.750]  It was like the original guys in Holland who did everything.
[26:56.750 --> 27:00.070]  Like anything shady back in the day, it was always XS for All.
[27:00.070 --> 27:01.550]  It was like, well, okay.
[27:01.550 --> 27:03.230]  It was in the same building as them.
[27:03.230 --> 27:09.030]  But actually, that kind of swings it around to when I heard that Swerve was going to join us, I was like, okay.
[27:09.030 --> 27:13.030]  Well, interesting enough, I remember the show that you came.
[27:13.030 --> 27:17.750]  And I remember that it was funny because like we didn't actually talk during that show because we were both busy doing our own things.
[27:17.750 --> 27:19.710]  And then later there was this kind of like, yeah, I don't know.
[27:19.710 --> 27:21.190]  I think Adam doesn't like me or something like that.
[27:21.190 --> 27:22.950]  And that's just kind of how the industry rolled.
[27:22.950 --> 27:23.750]  But it wasn't even that.
[27:23.750 --> 27:28.550]  I think it was a situation of that I recognized at that time because I had heard your name.
[27:28.550 --> 27:35.590]  And I think you were one of the first guys, in my opinion, because it wasn't that...
[27:35.630 --> 27:44.950]  I mean, there was people selling online, but there wasn't a lot of people putting their name out there yet that kind of like put their face behind it, I think.
[27:44.950 --> 27:53.710]  And so I think I kind of was curious at the time because I felt like you were part of that next generation of breeders coming up.
[27:53.710 --> 28:01.830]  And not as an insult, but I was like, oh, see, he's got a little system because he's like online high-fiving himself every five minutes.
[28:02.630 --> 28:05.430]  But his home crew, his homeboys like...
[28:05.430 --> 28:10.110]  But we were actually creating waves that I was seeing in Amsterdam just by the name.
[28:10.110 --> 28:10.510]  You know what I mean?
[28:10.510 --> 28:16.630]  So I give you definitely kudos for that because that was also like, as you see, the hustle has gotten fierce.
[28:16.630 --> 28:25.670]  But it's also kind of like ridiculous, too, because like the quality of the camera that we have in our phones is nuts.
[28:25.670 --> 28:26.190]  You know what I mean?
[28:26.190 --> 28:30.750]  Like back in the day, to get a photo of your cannabis was such a struggle.
[28:30.750 --> 28:32.230]  Your cannabis back in the day.
[28:32.230 --> 28:36.790]  Yeah, like I was trying all the time to like imagining, oh, imagine if you could.
[28:36.790 --> 28:42.510]  And, you know, literally like the other day I got one of those little tiny scope things and I was like, you see where we're at now?
[28:42.510 --> 28:44.310]  So you just click, click it on your phone.
[28:44.310 --> 28:46.470]  Now you got a 400 times zoom.
[28:46.470 --> 28:48.110]  You can take photos, videos.
[28:48.110 --> 28:51.110]  And I'm like thinking to myself like, man, we were like struggling.
[28:51.110 --> 28:53.750]  I was like trying every angle to make things work.
[28:53.750 --> 29:01.230]  But also the Internet was sort of like I grew up in a generation that was kind of like we didn't take, we didn't like we're Generation X.
[29:01.230 --> 29:05.830]  So we didn't really like jump to it as much as the next generation, which definitely jumped to it.
[29:05.830 --> 29:14.590]  And I think now it's, it is like if it's like, like he was saying, if your Instagram account gets deleted, you have no existence.
[29:14.590 --> 29:27.150]  And it's like, I feel like that's kind of, it shows you a little bit of where the sales, it's a lot of smoke and mirrors, you know, and you can't smell the weed, right?
[29:27.150 --> 29:27.950]  You can't smoke the weed.
[29:27.950 --> 29:30.630]  You can see the weed or some awesome photos.
[29:30.630 --> 29:34.550]  And like I was saying, cameras are as good as a SLR camera was.
[29:34.550 --> 29:37.270]  They can make the weed look way better than it is for sure.
[29:37.270 --> 29:39.470]  Yeah. And some people just have a really good eye, right?
[29:39.470 --> 29:41.270]  They could like, bam.
[29:41.270 --> 29:45.230]  All that avid in Eagle 20 doesn't come up on film.
[29:45.230 --> 29:46.430]  Right.
[29:46.430 --> 29:49.430]  But what, so what's your situation now?
[29:49.430 --> 29:54.470]  Like you're kind of bringing, you're kind of bringing things back online.
[29:54.470 --> 29:55.430]  Yeah, keeping it going.
[29:55.430 --> 29:58.030]  You know, we've been just kind of been low key.
[29:58.030 --> 30:05.790]  Unfortunately, you know, like most in this industry, we hit a minor roadblock called the police department.
[30:05.790 --> 30:09.030]  And then they won first place second.
[30:09.030 --> 30:12.630]  But thanksfully we have solid lawyers and they took care of everything for us.
[30:12.630 --> 30:15.830]  And we've managed to mitigate our losses.
[30:15.830 --> 30:22.230]  And we've been just direct sales as well as our wholesale over in Europe and whatnot.
[30:22.230 --> 30:26.910]  We faded away from Europe for a minute, but we've been hitting the states pretty hard.
[30:26.910 --> 30:38.990]  We're hopefully about to announce once everything's locked down and signed, you know, a tri-state deal, bringing us to Nevada, Arizona and California legally.
[30:38.990 --> 30:51.510]  Which would be kind of cool to be able to embark on that one because we've been fighting for Nevada for since my now defunct partnership with MJ America in Colorado.
[30:51.510 --> 30:52.910]  Otherwise, I'm just keeping it going.
[30:52.910 --> 30:54.990]  Like, you know, like, oh, yeah, that's true.
[30:54.990 --> 30:58.430]  Now that you say that, now that you say that, I'm like, oh, yeah, Salazar.
[30:58.430 --> 30:59.190]  Oh, yeah.
[30:59.190 --> 31:00.230]  You got a good old.
[31:00.230 --> 31:06.790]  I remember being in his office probably a month or two after you were there.
[31:06.790 --> 31:15.790]  And I think and I was wondering how that and that's a classic example of of how the the the industry kind of gobbles up talent.
[31:15.790 --> 31:18.070]  Takes it, eats it up, takes what they want from you.
[31:18.070 --> 31:18.590]  Yeah.
[31:18.590 --> 31:25.390]  Well, he was he was you were dealing with a guy like literally a loan shark.
[31:25.390 --> 31:26.550]  You know what I mean?
[31:26.550 --> 31:28.070]  That's what he did for a living.
[31:28.070 --> 31:30.630]  So I was like, OK, well, I guess I know where we're at here.
[31:30.630 --> 31:32.590]  Yeah.
[31:32.590 --> 31:33.630]  Yeah. So that's interesting.
[31:33.630 --> 31:40.590]  So you're so that that actually the whole vault thing just sort of.
[31:40.590 --> 31:41.910]  Yeah. The whole vault thing.
[31:41.910 --> 31:56.350]  They when it came down to finances, I got a beautiful letter from their lawyer and said, we appreciate all the genetics that you did for us, all the breeding that you did for us, everything that you did for us.
[31:56.350 --> 32:02.310]  But have a great day because you can't be a part of it anymore.
[32:02.310 --> 32:16.070]  And as that because of the out of state situation, because of the out of state thing, and they didn't want to they didn't want to do things the opposite side, which was the licensing way, which would have been able to allow us to retain the control of the IP.
[32:16.070 --> 32:24.070]  Which is one thing that after I realized and learn off of that one was and has been my main focus and pitch is intellectual property.
[32:24.070 --> 32:39.750]  People forget about the IP part and about the fact of like we're all talking when you work with these major corporations now, that's what I refer to them as, you know, these huge farms that can buy you ten times over and you do all of their genetics for them.
[32:39.750 --> 32:41.310]  Well, that's their IP now.
[32:41.310 --> 32:43.350]  And you forget that and don't realize it.
[32:43.350 --> 32:45.310]  You've just lost your legs.
[32:45.310 --> 32:56.510]  Yeah, no, it's 100. I mean, the best deal you can do as a grower is become like a decent percentage owner that makes it so that what you're doing is for the for the bigger for the greater good.
[32:56.510 --> 33:04.430]  Yeah, because if you're trying to come in and exactly what you're saying, like the minute you bring, because by law, when you bring genetics into their facility, it's their thing.
[33:04.430 --> 33:09.230]  There's no way that you can argue that unless you write it into your contract somehow.
[33:09.230 --> 33:11.630]  But even if you do, you're the one that broke the law.
[33:11.630 --> 33:12.870]  So you're writing yourself out.
[33:12.870 --> 33:15.710]  Oh, yeah, I ship plants across the country.
[33:15.710 --> 33:17.470]  Oh, that's against the law.
[33:17.470 --> 33:18.670]  So we got an ISO right there.
[33:18.670 --> 33:20.670]  Boom.
[33:20.670 --> 33:21.670]  What?
[33:21.670 --> 33:25.070]  You can't say that, you know, when you're trying to battle them in the in the court of law.
[33:25.070 --> 33:26.550]  Yeah, they're going to win every time.
[33:26.550 --> 33:33.470]  Yeah, it's it's been definitely proven over and over again.
[33:33.470 --> 33:38.710]  I mean, that's one of the things that's the hardest part as a as a grower, breeder in the industry.
[33:38.710 --> 33:44.590]  When I first came back to America, I was like convinced that, you know, I was like, oh, this is going to be, you know, no problem.
[33:44.590 --> 33:47.110]  And I just like hit roadblock after roadblock.
[33:47.110 --> 33:57.270]  And it always came down to partnerships based on the you know, if unless you were working with somebody that was 100 percent the owner, financer and all of the above.
[33:57.270 --> 34:02.790]  There's always that like, oh, by the way, so and so doesn't like this, that or the other.
[34:02.790 --> 34:05.030]  And all of a sudden, you know, all the all deals are off.
[34:05.070 --> 34:08.350]  And it really the it's sad.
[34:08.350 --> 34:15.470]  But, you know, when you bring genetics, a living thing like that, the minute that they can replicate it, they're going to do it.
[34:15.470 --> 34:16.710]  And, you know, it's going to happen.
[34:16.870 --> 34:18.510]  So you have to always anticipate that.
[34:18.670 --> 34:24.070]  And then when it comes to, like you said, you know, if you get locked out, you can't.
[34:24.070 --> 34:25.870]  And it's really hard to do this.
[34:25.870 --> 34:27.110]  A recourse is hard.
[34:27.350 --> 34:30.390]  So so what are your guys' thoughts on material transfer agreements?
[34:30.510 --> 34:34.790]  Basically signing that if you sell people seeds that they're not going to be breeding with them.
[34:35.430 --> 34:37.350]  It's impossible to do anything with.
[34:37.430 --> 34:38.230]  You can't. You can't.
[34:38.230 --> 34:39.750]  It's like it's like the Crawford brothers.
[34:39.750 --> 34:45.470]  This right now is a good example where they got really everybody, anybody who tries it.
[34:45.470 --> 34:49.710]  It doesn't work. The same thing with even with Milo from all the big hemp companies.
[34:49.710 --> 34:57.270]  So so Big Buddha, Big Buddha tried to he sent letters of, you know, to anybody using any cheese of any type.
[34:57.270 --> 35:01.270]  Right. And I even just I told him I was like, dude, I'm doing fromage.
[35:01.270 --> 35:03.430]  It's a cheese sage cross.
[35:03.710 --> 35:04.990]  What are you going to do about it? Right.
[35:04.990 --> 35:06.190]  You know, it's like nothing.
[35:06.790 --> 35:08.710]  Just, you know, it's just him trying.
[35:08.710 --> 35:16.030]  And like it's one of those situations where I was like, well, I didn't really I think it hurt your image in the industry more than helped it because we're kind of all in it.
[35:16.470 --> 35:25.630]  Like we know Milo and Big Buddha, even though they didn't create it, they just it's like it wasn't even a creation of theirs, but I'll give it to them.
[35:25.910 --> 35:27.830]  They promoted it. They got it out there.
[35:27.830 --> 35:28.670]  It's just like me.
[35:28.830 --> 35:36.670]  But they don't. But when you start to say like anything cheese related, which now you're stepping into a whole other industry, too.
[35:36.670 --> 35:41.950]  So it's like what? So now none of us can say, you know, anything is like cheese cheddar.
[35:41.950 --> 35:45.430]  Come on now. You know, we were saying we were using people were.
[35:45.990 --> 35:49.230]  It's amazing that it didn't get used as a name for cannabis lawn earlier.
[35:49.230 --> 35:51.790]  I made my opinion. It was one of those like Jesus.
[35:51.790 --> 35:53.190]  Why don't we live in Holland?
[35:53.190 --> 35:55.470]  Why don't we? Why were we not thinking of this?
[35:55.470 --> 35:57.790]  You know, we were the king of puns.
[35:57.790 --> 36:00.190]  It was the easiest. It would have been the easiest train.
[36:00.750 --> 36:13.310]  But in general, I think, you know, we're like we were saying earlier, it's really you can do all you should trademark your stuff if you really are confident that you're the first person to do it and you have something super original and it seems to be valuable.
[36:13.310 --> 36:15.590]  It's a good idea. It's not very enforceable.
[36:15.590 --> 36:17.670]  And you may have is enforceable.
[36:17.670 --> 36:22.870]  I think I think you could probably as a big company making seeds, you could probably enforce it to a degree.
[36:22.910 --> 36:26.150]  And it's more enforceable because it's recognized by either way.
[36:26.150 --> 36:27.870]  They're all still enforceable.
[36:28.390 --> 36:34.470]  Yeah. My patent and trademark attorney, like he's very much so explain to us how you can enforce it.
[36:35.630 --> 36:41.070]  But it comes down to the fact, are you going to spend fifteen thousand dollars to enforce you from using something?
[36:41.230 --> 36:42.990]  Yeah. You're not going to spend that kind of money.
[36:42.990 --> 36:44.230]  You're not going to waste that money.
[36:44.950 --> 36:46.710]  It's the fact it's the truth.
[36:46.950 --> 36:48.190]  But if somebody's million.
[36:48.190 --> 36:57.710]  The thing is, you're always losing when I feel like whenever you're on the attack, like say you're the guy who is out there attacking you're you're you're looking like an asshole damaging your brain.
[36:57.710 --> 36:59.710]  And you're also not going to win.
[37:00.190 --> 37:06.590]  Really, you might get the guy to like, you know, change the name if he's smart, which, you know, is not a big deal for the most part.
[37:06.950 --> 37:09.470]  But your genetics are already compromised at that point.
[37:09.470 --> 37:11.310]  And that's the way that people a lot of times don't get it.
[37:11.310 --> 37:14.190]  They're like, you know, to me, the names.
[37:14.190 --> 37:15.070]  OK, that's one thing.
[37:15.070 --> 37:18.750]  And names are actually easier to to protect because it's a name.
[37:18.750 --> 37:19.830]  Sure. Genetics.
[37:19.950 --> 37:23.590]  No, there's less you've got DNA snippets and you have actual markers on them.
[37:23.590 --> 37:29.750]  You're not going to have to have a genetically modified plant to be able to protect it as a patent of the situation.
[37:29.750 --> 37:36.470]  You can't just protect a cultivar with the material transfer agreement that just states that you're not going to breed with their genetics.
[37:36.870 --> 37:39.110]  And again, that's, I think, so unenforceable.
[37:39.110 --> 37:41.550]  So you think that they're not going to breed with your genetics?
[37:42.190 --> 37:43.630]  What happens if they what?
[37:44.110 --> 37:45.550]  Well, here's the question, OK?
[37:45.550 --> 37:46.830]  Well, here's the question to that.
[37:46.830 --> 37:49.750]  What happens if they have a Hermian and all of a sudden their whole room's pollinated?
[37:49.750 --> 37:51.470]  Now they have shit tons of seeds.
[37:51.470 --> 37:52.310]  What are they supposed to do?
[37:52.310 --> 37:53.270]  Throw them away?
[37:53.270 --> 37:54.910]  I test mine for stress.
[37:54.910 --> 37:57.070]  So I know I understand what you're saying.
[37:57.310 --> 37:59.790]  Because that's the same ploy as Monsanto's ploy.
[37:59.790 --> 38:02.830]  Monsanto trademarked markers within their...
[38:02.990 --> 38:03.550]  Yeah, that's the thing.
[38:03.550 --> 38:04.350]  Majorly unqualified.
[38:04.350 --> 38:09.310]  Let's say I spend a hundred thousand dollars worth of research and I'm selling these seeds for a dollar a seed and I sell them to somebody.
[38:09.310 --> 38:11.310]  They buy fifty thousand dollars worth of seed.
[38:11.790 --> 38:14.710]  Then they replicate it and they're selling the same exact seed.
[38:15.070 --> 38:16.630]  They're S1ing it or whatever.
[38:16.830 --> 38:17.150]  Yeah.
[38:17.150 --> 38:19.470]  Well, no, again, as far as ethics, I think you're...
[38:19.470 --> 38:20.310]  Ethics wise, with all my friends.
[38:20.310 --> 38:23.670]  I think the only way you can protect yourself is if you did put those markers in.
[38:23.670 --> 38:24.470]  That's not the case on this industry.
[38:24.470 --> 38:25.590]  Which cost a bunch of money.
[38:25.590 --> 38:27.510]  So you have to do that and you have to.
[38:27.830 --> 38:28.510]  That's the only way.
[38:28.510 --> 38:30.750]  Otherwise, it would be like no, no way.
[38:31.110 --> 38:31.470]  Yeah.
[38:31.470 --> 38:32.110]  In my opinion.
[38:32.110 --> 38:33.430]  So who sells the good hep C?
[38:33.430 --> 38:36.070]  CBD Cruise.
[38:36.070 --> 38:37.070]  Cibia.
[38:37.430 --> 38:38.270]  I could tell you.
[38:38.270 --> 38:39.550]  I could tell you.
[38:40.070 --> 38:49.030]  I could give you a very strong company in Oregon not to go with because they'll give you nothing but THC.
[38:50.190 --> 38:51.030]  THC.
[38:51.030 --> 38:51.830]  The real THC.
[38:51.830 --> 38:53.030]  Nothing but THC.
[38:53.030 --> 38:54.030]  Nothing but it.
[38:54.030 --> 38:56.070]  Nothing but THC.
[38:56.070 --> 38:56.470]  That's it.
[38:57.030 --> 38:58.310]  And it's hemp, but it's not.
[38:58.310 --> 38:59.870]  So Spectrum, the wife.
[39:00.270 --> 39:02.350]  What's a good strain to look for?
[39:02.430 --> 39:04.750]  I think there's a lot of good hemp strains out there.
[39:04.870 --> 39:05.150]  Yeah.
[39:05.150 --> 39:06.430]  Cherry wine's good.
[39:06.430 --> 39:07.430]  Cherry blossom.
[39:08.230 --> 39:08.630]  Yeah.
[39:08.630 --> 39:09.350]  I mean, I've seen some.
[39:09.350 --> 39:11.190]  I've seen a lot of it depends on your.
[39:11.190 --> 39:12.950]  It depends where you're located to.
[39:12.950 --> 39:17.590]  Like some things like the T1 this year worked really well in Colorado and last year not so great.
[39:17.590 --> 39:17.950]  So.
[39:19.190 --> 39:19.710]  Oh.
[39:21.030 --> 39:23.110]  She was trying to like crop me.
[39:23.470 --> 39:25.190]  No, but I completely agree.
[39:25.190 --> 39:27.630]  I mean, sometimes flowering on hemp is too long.
[39:27.630 --> 39:28.590]  You never know.
[39:28.590 --> 39:29.030]  Yeah.
[39:29.030 --> 39:30.470]  That's like point three.
[39:30.830 --> 39:31.350]  Dr.
[39:31.350 --> 39:32.110]  Who.
[39:32.470 --> 39:32.950]  Carly.
[39:33.230 --> 39:34.030]  Well, you know, the thing too.
[39:34.030 --> 39:40.430]  I think people that are flowering hemp too long or a week too long go above a point three level.
[39:40.430 --> 39:42.590]  So it's not the hemp level on that part.
[39:42.590 --> 39:43.870]  So you can't control that.
[39:43.870 --> 39:45.830]  It doesn't get hot, though.
[39:46.230 --> 39:46.990]  That's what we're working on.
[39:47.350 --> 39:50.150]  Like if you compare it to the not hot hemp.
[39:50.710 --> 39:52.630]  That's what I'm trying to get the inside.
[39:52.630 --> 39:53.950]  Like what's not hot?
[39:53.950 --> 39:54.430]  What's not?
[39:54.430 --> 40:03.470]  I mean, so if you look at cherry wine, cherry wine, for example, there's so many different phenotypes of cherry wine, but there are phenotypes that do not go above a point three.
[40:03.470 --> 40:07.710]  But I mean, I feel like that's the same about the Electra hemp that you're talking about.
[40:07.710 --> 40:12.950]  That's the most common hemp out on the strain right now on the product for a CBD joint.
[40:12.950 --> 40:18.470]  So it makes no sense that people are flowering that same hemp at home and it's a week or two too long.
[40:18.710 --> 40:22.150]  I mean, it's above that point three, especially if they're going through it.
[40:22.150 --> 40:23.510]  We just haven't fully figured it out.
[40:23.510 --> 40:28.670]  The tomato industry has figured out tomatoes over the last 50 years, using them as an example.
[40:28.670 --> 40:31.550]  And we're just scratching the surface of this stuff.
[40:31.550 --> 40:35.310]  I mean, we're going to have hemp plants that have zero...
[40:35.310 --> 40:36.950]  Which is understandable. It's just a brand new industry.
[40:36.950 --> 40:37.990]  I mean, look at it this way.
[40:37.990 --> 40:41.230]  Yeah, Gencanna has a zero THC that comes out zero the whole time.
[40:41.230 --> 40:43.390]  So it's Gencanna from Kentucky.
[40:43.390 --> 40:44.110]  Oh, I mean, we...
[40:45.110 --> 40:48.110]  There's other... You can also spray your plants with stuff that will prevent it from...
[40:48.110 --> 40:50.390]  I'm going to spray it with sugar water and have it...
[40:50.390 --> 40:55.830]  But the question is, it's like the CBG side of the fence, the people that are specialized in CBG.
[40:55.830 --> 41:00.990]  It's like you have to find that one cultivar and really replicate the absolute shit out of that somehow.
[41:01.110 --> 41:02.230]  I guess what we're saying is...
[41:02.230 --> 41:03.790]  And also flowering times.
[41:03.790 --> 41:09.230]  Where do we look to for the future of the CBD hemp?
[41:09.230 --> 41:11.630]  Give it about two years and then you'll be able to figure it out.
[41:11.630 --> 41:13.310]  Right now, so...
[41:13.310 --> 41:16.350]  Well, just don't put all your eggs in one basket with anything right now.
[41:16.350 --> 41:17.030]  Like, be a...
[41:18.030 --> 41:18.670]  Sorry.
[41:18.670 --> 41:24.430]  I was going to say, just like, you know, take it to account that if you run hot and you have one strain in the field,
[41:24.430 --> 41:26.470]  then you've got to take down that whole thing.
[41:26.470 --> 41:33.870]  So think along the line of compartmentalizing your situation and having maybe different fields doing different things and taking...
[41:33.870 --> 41:38.310]  You know, because the problem is, it's also if you're trying to grow a smokable hemp or you're trying to grow biomass.
[41:38.310 --> 41:43.470]  If you're trying to grow biomass or if you're trying to grow other cannabinoids besides CBD, there's other flowers.
[41:43.470 --> 41:47.110]  You can take stuff way earlier to guarantee that you're not going to have it.
[41:47.110 --> 41:50.150]  And don't try to ride that line because there's a lot of times...
[41:50.150 --> 41:54.070]  You know, we're not trying to get the same end result unless you are trying to get a smokable flower.
[41:54.070 --> 41:56.990]  And if you're trying to get a smokable flower, I would just do...
[41:56.990 --> 41:59.710]  I would do clone only in greenhouses.
[41:59.710 --> 42:01.910]  That way I know exactly what's going on in there.
[42:01.910 --> 42:03.030]  Real deal stuff.
[42:03.030 --> 42:03.590]  Yeah, I know.
[42:03.590 --> 42:07.230]  Even though I love seeds, it'd just be safer right now.
[42:07.230 --> 42:08.910]  But the clone still has to come from a seed.
[42:08.910 --> 42:09.950]  It's the wild one.
[42:09.950 --> 42:11.270]  You can get it right to the market.
[42:11.270 --> 42:14.870]  You can get it to like a 0.289 or something.
[42:14.870 --> 42:15.870]  You know, so you're...
[42:15.870 --> 42:19.070]  My breeder and my source is right here.
[42:19.070 --> 42:20.630]  But I mean, CBD...
[42:20.630 --> 42:21.230]  Yeah.
[42:21.270 --> 42:23.950]  Willy G, you know the Willy G.
[42:23.950 --> 42:24.470]  Yeah.
[42:24.470 --> 42:28.830]  And I think, you know, right now like CBG is a big cannabinoid that always, you know,
[42:28.830 --> 42:35.950]  it followed the same trend as CBD as far as a kilo of CBD two years ago was worth about 20,000, right?
[42:35.950 --> 42:38.950]  And now it's worth about 2,200 or 2,000, let's say.
[42:38.950 --> 42:41.790]  That's 10 times drop in two years.
[42:41.790 --> 42:46.390]  CBD was 60,000 last year and it's already 20,000.
[42:46.390 --> 42:47.270]  It'll be 10,000.
[42:47.270 --> 42:49.350]  It's going to drop just like everything else.
[42:49.390 --> 42:51.830]  And so everybody keeps like, oh, what's the next one?
[42:51.830 --> 42:52.830]  You know, how to isolate it all.
[42:52.830 --> 42:56.710]  Yeah. I mean, these guys in Oregon now have a CBD cultivar that is, you know,
[42:56.710 --> 42:58.710]  tests between 9% and 15%.
[42:58.710 --> 43:01.310]  Which is what strain?
[43:01.310 --> 43:03.030]  Electra?
[43:03.030 --> 43:04.190]  Testing 30%?
[43:04.190 --> 43:04.670]  No.
[43:04.670 --> 43:06.510]  30%?
[43:06.510 --> 43:11.830]  I mean, like our Boax, our Boax MC is 18%, 16%.
[43:11.830 --> 43:15.710]  Yeah, like 17, 18 seems to be like the kind of coasting line for a lot of this stuff.
[43:15.710 --> 43:19.310]  There's some little pops here and there, but I never heard 30% myself.
[43:19.310 --> 43:23.710]  Yeah. 30% is when you see the THC levels where you're like...
[43:23.710 --> 43:26.350]  But then you're probably...
[43:26.350 --> 43:28.710]  At that point, I would imagine you are over the line.
[43:28.710 --> 43:31.550]  Yeah, Viagra for CBD.
[43:31.550 --> 43:32.270]  What's interesting...
[43:32.270 --> 43:33.230]  My dick's hard.
[43:33.230 --> 43:35.950]  So they're able to convert from CBD...
[43:35.950 --> 43:38.350]  That was a joke.
[43:38.350 --> 43:39.550]  That was a joke.
[43:39.550 --> 43:40.710]  Repeat the joke?
[43:40.710 --> 43:42.910]  I think you don't want to do it.
[43:42.910 --> 43:48.870]  So CBD basically is a precursor and you can convert that into other cannabinoids.
[43:48.870 --> 43:54.790]  And CBD can now be converted to THC using enzymes.
[43:54.790 --> 43:58.550]  So technically, world shipping for cannabis is no longer an issue.
[43:58.550 --> 44:02.550]  You ship it as hemp, as CBD.
[44:02.550 --> 44:05.590]  I was going to say, it's kind of funny because as you're saying that,
[44:05.590 --> 44:11.710]  there's enzymes you can put on the plant in the field and completely knock out THC also.
[44:11.710 --> 44:16.350]  There's a group in Hawaii right now and they claim...
[44:16.390 --> 44:18.110]  They're out of Oregon, but now they're in Hawaii.
[44:18.110 --> 44:22.390]  Because the thing is, all around the...
[44:22.390 --> 44:24.990]  Like anywhere that's got really good growing conditions,
[44:24.990 --> 44:28.070]  it's very hard to keep your shit below like 1%.
[44:28.070 --> 44:28.470]  You know what I mean?
[44:28.470 --> 44:31.990]  It just wants to spike because of the conditions being so perfect.
[44:31.990 --> 44:33.910]  So Hawaii had a...
[44:33.910 --> 44:37.510]  The few people that actually had licenses, most of them ran hot last year too,
[44:37.510 --> 44:38.510]  just like a lot of places.
[44:38.510 --> 44:43.830]  So they're testing that there and that's a game changer in itself
[44:43.830 --> 44:48.990]  because you could take straight up THC strain and then in the field,
[44:48.990 --> 44:53.710]  hit it hard and have all those turps but not have any THC on the final product.
[44:53.710 --> 44:55.590]  So I think we're going to come up...
[44:55.590 --> 44:59.830]  Just like anything, we're going to kind of slip our way around as much as we can.
[44:59.830 --> 45:04.470]  And just the ability to grow on a scale that we're finally able to grow on
[45:04.470 --> 45:10.870]  just creates more bigger ideas and bigger moves that we can hopefully do
[45:10.870 --> 45:12.670]  and stay one step ahead.
[45:12.710 --> 45:14.550]  We're just scratching the surface of all this stuff.
[45:14.550 --> 45:19.670]  It's like we're just learning how to cultivate properly and how to breed properly.
[45:19.670 --> 45:26.630]  And marker-assisted breeding, I believe GMO has its place potential.
[45:26.630 --> 45:30.030]  I compare it to like brain surgery, how if you're...
[45:30.030 --> 45:32.390]  They were scared of brain surgery when people started doing it.
[45:32.390 --> 45:34.110]  And GMO might not be the solution.
[45:34.110 --> 45:35.150]  We probably...
[45:35.150 --> 45:36.710]  Who knows if we'll even have to do it in our lifetime.
[45:36.710 --> 45:40.670]  I mean, we can use analytical-driven breeding and marker-driven breeding
[45:40.670 --> 45:43.790]  without actually editing the genes.
[45:43.790 --> 45:46.830]  But I mean, we're just scratching the surface of all this stuff.
[45:46.830 --> 45:49.430]  Now, we're like Dedy Miri out of Israel.
[45:49.430 --> 45:50.870]  He's doing a lot of clinical research.
[45:50.870 --> 45:54.990]  He's the number one cancer clinical research scientist in the world.
[45:54.990 --> 46:00.910]  And he's comparing it all with different cannabinoid profiles and chemotyping,
[46:00.910 --> 46:03.790]  which is basically going in and looking at the chemical expression of the plant
[46:03.790 --> 46:05.750]  and how it works with people's bodies.
[46:05.750 --> 46:06.950]  And we're just...
[46:06.950 --> 46:09.310]  You know, he discovered all these receptors.
[46:09.350 --> 46:12.990]  Before we only had two, they thought we had CB1 and CB2 receptors.
[46:12.990 --> 46:17.710]  Now from CB1 and CB2 receptors, they have 28 other like nuclear receptors
[46:17.710 --> 46:21.550]  in our body that actually interact with cannabinoids.
[46:21.550 --> 46:22.910]  And so...
[46:22.910 --> 46:24.070]  And that's just the...
[46:24.070 --> 46:26.390]  Flavonoids is a whole other thing that we really don't talk about,
[46:26.390 --> 46:31.030]  but that is what they believe will help cure pancreatic cancer.
[46:31.030 --> 46:32.870]  And so even from a medical side,
[46:32.870 --> 46:35.830]  we're just really scratching the surface of what's possible.
[46:35.830 --> 46:38.230]  10 years from now, we'll have a lot more of it figured out,
[46:38.230 --> 46:40.430]  but I still don't believe we'll have it all figured out.
[46:40.430 --> 46:42.510]  There's no way, because just like you're saying,
[46:42.510 --> 46:45.710]  10 years ago, it was as illegal as it can get.
[46:45.710 --> 46:47.390]  You know, there wasn't clinical trials,
[46:47.390 --> 46:49.510]  there wasn't actual labs that were testing.
[46:49.510 --> 46:53.870]  I mean, there were, but they were just starting out, you know?
[46:53.870 --> 46:55.790]  Well, universities, I mean, that's where it gets...
[46:55.790 --> 46:58.070]  That's where it's really interesting, because, you know,
[46:58.070 --> 47:02.870]  they're getting grants to study something that should have been studied a lot.
[47:02.870 --> 47:04.630]  I mean, for the last 75 years,
[47:04.630 --> 47:08.710]  they've been sort of only studying it on a negative...
[47:08.710 --> 47:10.230]  You know, looking for negative results,
[47:10.230 --> 47:12.990]  not even, like, wanting positive results.
[47:12.990 --> 47:15.390]  And now it's pretty interesting for,
[47:15.390 --> 47:17.990]  if you think about, like, a young kid going into college
[47:17.990 --> 47:21.350]  and he has an option to really take cannabis on a next level,
[47:21.350 --> 47:23.870]  serious from a biological point of view.
[47:23.870 --> 47:26.270]  And I think they're going to have...
[47:26.270 --> 47:30.310]  You know, think about the 50,000 ways that they already knew
[47:30.310 --> 47:32.150]  what to use hemp for,
[47:32.150 --> 47:36.190]  and then add into that also these high cannabinoid plants,
[47:36.190 --> 47:37.470]  which nobody was really...
[47:37.470 --> 47:40.230]  I mean, they were out there, but nobody was really focusing on them.
[47:40.230 --> 47:48.190]  So now we have a whole arsenal of potential compounds coming out of that.
[47:48.190 --> 47:49.750]  That are just...
[47:49.750 --> 47:53.310]  Well, that are going to be, like, epically, you know,
[47:53.310 --> 47:56.310]  beyond anything that we're even comprehending when it comes to, like,
[47:56.310 --> 48:01.830]  when you see how simple some of those things, like with hemp, for instance,
[48:01.870 --> 48:05.430]  because also that's, again, like with hemp, cannabis, it's the same thing.
[48:05.430 --> 48:07.870]  And imagine when we grow, like, the ultimate plant,
[48:07.870 --> 48:12.150]  which is a high THC, high CBD, high fibre content,
[48:12.150 --> 48:16.030]  high, you know, cellulose content, everything, all the above.
[48:16.030 --> 48:18.070]  Oh, and it has all the other cannabinoids in it.
[48:18.070 --> 48:21.350]  All, and it grows 15 feet tall, and it does...
[48:21.350 --> 48:22.990]  You know, there's all these things we haven't even...
[48:22.990 --> 48:26.190]  Because we're still trying to separate the differences,
[48:26.190 --> 48:27.390]  but they're all in there.
[48:27.390 --> 48:29.710]  And so there's a pretty exciting...
[48:29.710 --> 48:31.150]  Like, the next 10 years are going to be awesome.
[48:31.190 --> 48:34.750]  There's going to be finally when people get over the whole CBD craze,
[48:34.750 --> 48:37.910]  they're going to get more into bioplastics and, you know,
[48:37.910 --> 48:43.270]  because that's something that I think is the next big problem in the world,
[48:43.270 --> 48:45.510]  is everyone's going to be on the same tip where it's like,
[48:45.510 --> 48:48.470]  yeah, this plastic situation is getting a little out of control.
[48:48.470 --> 48:49.510]  What else can we use?
[48:49.510 --> 48:53.390]  And, you know, Legos has already said that they're going to replace
[48:53.390 --> 48:57.790]  all of their Legos with hemp bioplastic by 2030.
[48:57.790 --> 49:00.470]  And that's like, you know, that's huge right there
[49:00.470 --> 49:01.710]  when you think about a company like that.
[49:01.710 --> 49:04.910]  So that's kind of where I'm excited,
[49:04.910 --> 49:08.670]  even, you know, as much as I'm excited about cannabis in general,
[49:08.670 --> 49:11.750]  that whole next generation of like,
[49:11.750 --> 49:15.150]  oh, the house is built out of it and the car is driving on it and all of...
[49:15.150 --> 49:18.590]  You know, that's where we're going to be going towards, I think.
[49:18.590 --> 49:19.510]  Except for you, James.
[49:19.510 --> 49:21.390]  Yeah, so for me.
[49:21.390 --> 49:24.950]  You'll be fighting with your merchant account, guys.
[49:24.950 --> 49:27.750]  Yeah, but commercial people should be hitting you guys up, no?
[49:27.750 --> 49:29.870]  I mean, right?
[49:29.910 --> 49:33.990]  I mean, commercial growers and commercial farms are contacting,
[49:33.990 --> 49:38.670]  I would assume, you, James, for bulk seed and for seed, right?
[49:38.670 --> 49:39.390]  Yeah.
[49:39.390 --> 49:40.750]  I mean, it's happening.
[49:40.750 --> 49:41.990]  But I don't...
[49:41.990 --> 49:45.710]  I've stayed away from bulk hemp seeds just for that very reason
[49:45.710 --> 49:48.550]  because the cherry wine was hot and I don't want to be responsible
[49:48.550 --> 49:50.190]  for somebody's losing their crop on my ads.
[49:50.190 --> 49:51.070]  Right, yeah.
[49:51.070 --> 49:52.310]  So I wasn't...
[49:52.310 --> 49:54.390]  I didn't step into that field.
[49:54.390 --> 49:56.070]  It wasn't my expertise and I...
[49:56.070 --> 49:58.110]  It's one of those things, I sell something, I can back up
[49:58.110 --> 50:00.950]  and I can see results and I see paperwork and I do my damage
[50:00.950 --> 50:02.430]  to get to the bottom of things.
[50:02.430 --> 50:05.910]  That organ company you speak of, I've talked with them and I almost...
[50:05.910 --> 50:07.070]  You know who I'm talking about.
[50:07.070 --> 50:08.390]  Yeah, and I just...
[50:08.390 --> 50:10.710]  I never wanted that on my conscience.
[50:10.710 --> 50:12.670]  I caused somebody their field to get tossed, so...
[50:12.670 --> 50:13.350]  That's crazy.
[50:13.350 --> 50:14.670]  I've never sold them for that reason.
[50:14.670 --> 50:16.190]  So we've stayed out of that.
[50:16.190 --> 50:18.870]  We do sell bulk film stock and bulk other seeds,
[50:18.870 --> 50:22.110]  but we haven't gotten into hemp seeds just because...
[50:22.110 --> 50:25.590]  I've got one company I work with and they've got three years with the COAs.
[50:25.630 --> 50:28.510]  So he's been doing it for a long time in Maine.
[50:28.510 --> 50:31.390]  That's the Best Coast guy.
[50:31.390 --> 50:32.790]  Best Coast Genetics.
[50:32.790 --> 50:34.510]  He uses an auto box drain.
[50:34.510 --> 50:35.230]  Beacon's good.
[50:35.230 --> 50:36.430]  I kind of care speaking of.
[50:36.430 --> 50:36.950]  Yeah.
[50:36.950 --> 50:37.470]  So...
[50:37.470 --> 50:40.550]  What's a legit hemp supplier?
[50:40.550 --> 50:41.590]  Beacon?
[50:41.590 --> 50:43.990]  Yeah, the BOAX, the BOAX.
[50:43.990 --> 50:48.470]  Build a soil's got a hemp seed line that's coming out, right?
[50:48.470 --> 50:50.510]  All of us have hemp seed lines, it's just...
[50:50.510 --> 50:51.990]  Yeah, the proof's in the pudding.
[50:51.990 --> 50:55.230]  I mean, we've got like seven hemp seed lines.
[50:55.390 --> 50:58.830]  We have literally seven different varietals that we put out in hemp.
[50:58.830 --> 51:01.230]  We have COAs for all of it, but...
[51:01.230 --> 51:02.230]  No?
[51:02.230 --> 51:06.030]  No, BOAX, Electra...
[51:06.030 --> 51:07.270]  Autos are going to be amazing.
[51:07.270 --> 51:08.630]  Autos are just coming out.
[51:08.630 --> 51:11.030]  You know, the auto hemps, they have a long ways to go.
[51:11.030 --> 51:11.910]  But just like how...
[51:11.910 --> 51:12.830]  So there's two autos.
[51:12.830 --> 51:16.350]  There's OTTO, which is an auto box drain.
[51:16.350 --> 51:19.270]  And then there's an auto as far as an auto flower.
[51:19.270 --> 51:21.710]  Auto flower is it.
[51:21.710 --> 51:23.190]  It has a lot of potential.
[51:23.190 --> 51:24.310]  Like we haven't figured it out completely yet.
[51:24.390 --> 51:27.430]  Do you really want like a little auto flower hemp plant?
[51:27.430 --> 51:29.110]  Yeah, and then what you do is you plant...
[51:29.110 --> 51:30.870]  Because then you're harvesting in like July.
[51:30.870 --> 51:32.030]  And then you plant like...
[51:32.030 --> 51:33.390]  Yeah, you get three harvests per year.
[51:33.390 --> 51:34.870]  You plant 20,000 per...
[51:34.870 --> 51:35.390]  Not even...
[51:35.390 --> 51:37.710]  You can plant 10,000 per acre.
[51:37.710 --> 51:40.590]  And so you plant more, but the thing is,
[51:40.590 --> 51:42.910]  we're working on getting these CBD level higher.
[51:42.910 --> 51:44.510]  That's the big thing is getting...
[51:44.510 --> 51:48.870]  Because right now, auto flowers are somewhere between 5% and 10% for CBD.
[51:48.870 --> 51:54.070]  And I think that's going to evolve into 18% to 20% CBD in the future,
[51:54.070 --> 51:56.750]  but it's going to require a lot of breeding.
[51:56.750 --> 51:58.630]  A lot of selection.
[51:58.630 --> 52:02.830]  A lot of selection, a lot of work, a lot of money.
[52:02.830 --> 52:04.830]  But I totally believe it's possible.
[52:04.830 --> 52:07.750]  Because I saw auto flowers in 2012.
[52:07.750 --> 52:13.630]  I went and saw Oliere's auto flowers in Spain, and they sucked.
[52:13.630 --> 52:14.230]  They were really...
[52:14.230 --> 52:15.750]  They were this tall.
[52:15.750 --> 52:16.430]  Loathing us.
[52:16.430 --> 52:17.790]  And yeah, they were...
[52:17.790 --> 52:21.150]  Well, so the further away you get from Rurales, the better it gets.
[52:21.190 --> 52:24.110]  And the stuff that's auto flower now is unbelievable.
[52:24.110 --> 52:27.670]  And you're getting stuff that tests high 20s.
[52:27.670 --> 52:28.910]  That has good flavor.
[52:28.910 --> 52:29.910]  Green light.
[52:29.910 --> 52:32.630]  Mephisto.
[52:32.630 --> 52:33.990]  Buddha's doing some good stuff for sure.
[52:33.990 --> 52:35.110]  Mephisto is killing it.
[52:35.110 --> 52:36.150]  Mephisto.
[52:36.150 --> 52:36.950]  Mephisto for sure.
[52:36.950 --> 52:41.070]  But even the stuff I'm doing with my buddy Nick.
[52:41.070 --> 52:41.470]  Green light.
[52:41.470 --> 52:42.710]  Open source.
[52:42.710 --> 52:44.510]  We're doing stuff together.
[52:44.510 --> 52:46.350]  So we're crushing some auto flowers.
[52:46.350 --> 52:48.110]  And we're testing really high.
[52:48.110 --> 52:50.950]  We're just testing stuff in the 20s with our auto flowers.
[52:50.950 --> 52:53.110]  And the deal is, is it's not right for everybody.
[52:53.110 --> 52:54.790]  It's not right for every situation.
[52:54.790 --> 52:59.030]  But for people that want to get multiple harvests in a year that are willing to
[52:59.030 --> 53:04.710]  invest in 15,000 to 20,000 seeds per acre, that might be the ideal solution.
[53:04.710 --> 53:07.670]  You know, it's not a one size fits all solution.
[53:07.670 --> 53:09.270]  There is no one size fits all solution.
[53:09.270 --> 53:10.110]  Yeah.
[53:10.110 --> 53:11.190]  It's an option.
[53:11.190 --> 53:11.910]  It's an option.
[53:11.910 --> 53:12.430]  It's an option.
[53:12.430 --> 53:14.310]  It's the guy in Alaska who needs it.
[53:14.310 --> 53:14.950]  He needs it.
[53:14.950 --> 53:17.150]  Yeah, there's a lot of situations that actually need it though too,
[53:17.190 --> 53:21.990]  where it's just like you can't rely on the, like especially bringing in a
[53:21.990 --> 53:23.710]  cultivar that's never grown in that region.
[53:23.710 --> 53:28.190]  Like Colorado's got some pretty intense weather.
[53:28.190 --> 53:28.710]  Weather please.
[53:28.710 --> 53:30.750]  And some people came in and grew.
[53:30.750 --> 53:33.790]  I went to one farm that had 16 pivots.
[53:33.790 --> 53:35.350]  Each pivot was 240 acres.
[53:35.350 --> 53:40.510]  So we're talking about 1,800 acres of hemp all within a few, it's a 15 and a
[53:40.510 --> 53:43.030]  half square mile area just packed.
[53:44.030 --> 53:48.510]  But next door to them was another 2,000 acres of guys who are growing industrial
[53:48.510 --> 53:52.070]  hemp and they were just letting stuff just blow across the thing.
[53:52.070 --> 53:55.710]  So it was like, wow, you guys are not growing any smokable hemp here.
[53:55.710 --> 53:56.270]  I'm sorry.
[53:56.270 --> 53:58.230]  Everything is seeded and they couldn't...
[53:58.230 --> 53:59.350]  I had a hard time taking that one.
[53:59.350 --> 54:05.550]  But in general, it's just, you know, yeah, the scale that people are growing now,
[54:05.550 --> 54:08.270]  there's tsunamis of pollen flying around.
[54:08.270 --> 54:08.750]  So...
[54:08.750 --> 54:10.150]  Yes, quickly.
[54:10.150 --> 54:10.950]  Yeah.
[54:10.950 --> 54:12.750]  Oh.
[54:12.950 --> 54:14.670]  Yeah, we can talk about it real quick.
[54:14.670 --> 54:16.830]  I got to fly to the Caribbean for work.
[54:16.830 --> 54:17.550]  He's got a quick...
[54:17.550 --> 54:18.710]  Quick...
[54:18.710 --> 54:20.230]  This is a collab.
[54:20.230 --> 54:21.710]  This is our collab that we're doing together.
[54:21.710 --> 54:27.790]  So these are some of the samples that were grown and for Adam to try out.
[54:27.790 --> 54:28.950]  You know, we basically...
[54:28.950 --> 54:29.470]  It's a hard job.
[54:29.470 --> 54:30.550]  I made these seeds a year ago.
[54:30.550 --> 54:31.990]  Yeah, it's a tough job, right?
[54:31.990 --> 54:34.070]  Somebody's got to smoke them all.
[54:34.070 --> 54:38.550]  And I basically make stuff and I make sure it's tested before it's ever released.
[54:38.550 --> 54:41.350]  So I want it grown out by multiple people.
[54:41.350 --> 54:42.190]  We do COAs.
[54:42.190 --> 54:44.110]  We do everything in compare.
[54:44.110 --> 54:45.790]  So, yeah, so ours is a sage and sour.
[54:45.790 --> 54:48.670]  I was talking about it earlier how I use three males instead of one.
[54:48.670 --> 54:52.430]  The master sage or is this the regular...
[54:52.430 --> 54:53.390]  No, sage and sour.
[54:53.390 --> 54:54.190]  Sage and sour.
[54:54.190 --> 54:54.830]  Sage and sour.
[54:54.830 --> 54:59.030]  So sage and sour, the first time I saw it was at Harborside in maybe 2008.
[54:59.030 --> 55:00.030]  And I really fell in love with it.
[55:00.030 --> 55:00.870]  I like sours.
[55:00.870 --> 55:06.030]  So the loud seeds that me and my friends started, it was based on sour diesel,
[55:06.030 --> 55:07.870]  like we love sour.
[55:07.870 --> 55:11.350]  And so sage and sour was this kind of like sour.
[55:12.350 --> 55:16.990]  The Fino they had was, it was a little more wispy, but it was like super greasy
[55:16.990 --> 55:17.990]  and it grew big.
[55:17.990 --> 55:20.030]  It didn't yield as good as sour or anything like that.
[55:20.030 --> 55:24.150]  But the taste was like lemon funk with the...
[55:24.150 --> 55:25.750]  And I fell in love with it.
[55:25.750 --> 55:29.270]  It's like that lemon funk with a little bit of that sage in there.
[55:29.270 --> 55:30.790]  So Adam and I kind of...
[55:30.790 --> 55:34.510]  I decided I was going to make seeds and I talked to Adam about doing a collab.
[55:34.510 --> 55:38.070]  And so I wanted to do some interesting crosses with it and I wanted to give
[55:38.070 --> 55:43.590]  people the most availability for the F1s for selections of their own.
[55:43.590 --> 55:48.630]  And so like this one right here, this is a LA antidote for FC Genetics
[55:48.630 --> 55:50.270]  from our buddy at FC.
[55:50.270 --> 55:53.510]  I got his 20 to 1.
[55:53.510 --> 55:57.070]  It's your buddy that I met that I got some clones off.
[55:57.070 --> 55:59.910]  And he, yeah, he has some good stuff.
[55:59.910 --> 56:02.870]  But yeah, so this was his LA antidote that he made and I put it on the sage and
[56:02.870 --> 56:04.950]  sour and it has some amazing...
[56:04.950 --> 56:07.590]  Check that out.
[56:07.590 --> 56:08.830]  There's two phenos of it here.
[56:08.830 --> 56:11.270]  So we'll grow and we'll do selections.
[56:11.270 --> 56:15.110]  Like I went to Arizona and worked with a company out there and we did selections
[56:15.110 --> 56:18.590]  on starting with 1,000 seeds, narrowed it down to 120.
[56:18.590 --> 56:22.190]  From the 120, after we pulled out the males and the herms and everything else,
[56:22.190 --> 56:25.590]  we selected about 35.
[56:25.590 --> 56:27.270]  And they still, they're keeping the 120.
[56:27.270 --> 56:29.790]  But like we do analytics, we do smoking.
[56:29.790 --> 56:30.750]  You got to...
[56:30.750 --> 56:32.150]  The analytics don't tell the whole story.
[56:32.150 --> 56:34.390]  No matter how much you want to believe they do.
[56:34.430 --> 56:40.670]  So yeah, so the skush from Duke Diamond, we put that on there and that has like
[56:40.670 --> 56:42.390]  that old school skunk smell.
[56:42.390 --> 56:44.630]  And if you smell it, it smells just like cantaloupe.
[56:44.630 --> 56:46.190]  You get fresh cantaloupe on this.
[56:46.190 --> 56:48.070]  That's good.
[56:48.070 --> 56:48.830]  I like this one.
[56:48.830 --> 56:51.710]  That's very clean smelling.
[56:51.710 --> 56:53.390]  You're living vicariously through our nose.
[56:53.390 --> 56:53.990]  Yeah.
[56:53.990 --> 56:56.190]  And you know, if you guys want to smell these afterwards.
[56:56.190 --> 56:58.230]  So I did the GMO sage and sour.
[56:58.230 --> 56:59.270]  I was originally...
[56:59.270 --> 57:00.950]  This one's got super skunky.
[57:00.950 --> 57:03.510]  I was originally going to call this gym shoes because this stuff stinks.
[57:03.510 --> 57:05.750]  It has like that BO from the Chem D.
[57:05.750 --> 57:10.090]  This is a...
[57:10.090 --> 57:11.130]  I got some phenos of that.
[57:11.130 --> 57:15.130]  And some came out lemony, some came out chemy.
[57:15.130 --> 57:17.090]  We got a little diversity with them.
[57:17.090 --> 57:17.410]  Yeah.
[57:17.410 --> 57:22.250]  And I like the fact that you didn't pick a super dominant male either.
[57:22.250 --> 57:26.490]  So it's like this is all flavors represented in a sense here.
[57:26.490 --> 57:26.730]  Yeah.
[57:26.730 --> 57:30.490]  Sometimes when you use a male that has a jack in it or something that's really
[57:30.490 --> 57:34.490]  dominant, it makes the whole progeny, whatever you put it on,
[57:34.490 --> 57:36.210]  smell and taste like that.
[57:36.210 --> 57:38.290]  And yeah, for sure.
[57:38.290 --> 57:41.290]  Well, not the Mac one, but like if you were to reverse it into other Macs that
[57:41.290 --> 57:44.770]  I've seen, they have a lot of that terpeneline and limonene and...
[57:44.770 --> 57:46.210]  Sure, it's dark.
[57:46.210 --> 57:47.010]  Yeah.
[57:47.010 --> 57:48.250]  Slow bend.
[57:48.250 --> 57:49.970]  Yeah, the Mac one, amazing.
[57:49.970 --> 57:51.210]  Okay.
[57:51.210 --> 57:52.370]  Yeah.
[57:52.370 --> 57:57.250]  So yeah, so the Josh D, you know, that's the original OG.
[57:57.290 --> 57:58.330]  But those...
[57:58.330 --> 58:02.370]  I did some Legend and I did some of the Josh D and they all came out great.
[58:02.370 --> 58:06.250]  So where is the Loud Seeds on Seeds Here Now or...
[58:06.250 --> 58:08.250]  There's no more Loud Seeds right now.
[58:08.250 --> 58:11.450]  We'll see what happens with Loud Seeds in the future.
[58:11.450 --> 58:13.290]  I have James Loud Genetics.
[58:13.290 --> 58:14.210]  So you can get that.
[58:14.210 --> 58:17.210]  You can get Green Light Genetics as my collab with the autoflowers that's
[58:17.210 --> 58:19.170]  available on Seeds Here Now.
[58:19.170 --> 58:22.770]  The collab that I'm doing with Adam is going to be available on Seeds Here Now.
[58:22.770 --> 58:25.730]  That's going to be my first TH seeds, my purchase.
[58:25.730 --> 58:25.850]  Yeah.
[58:25.850 --> 58:26.490]  Nice.
[58:26.490 --> 58:27.610]  Awesome.
[58:27.610 --> 58:29.250]  Technically, it's a Sage and Sour.
[58:29.250 --> 58:32.330]  It's been around for this long and it's your first purchase?
[58:32.330 --> 58:34.290]  That's it, but I'm not...
[58:34.290 --> 58:37.130]  Yeah, so the GMO Sage and Sour Superfire.
[58:37.130 --> 58:41.010]  And there's ones that lean towards the Sage, but the ones that lean towards the
[58:41.010 --> 58:46.090]  GMO that have that structure and that BO armpit, you know, funk.
[58:46.090 --> 58:48.570]  Amen.
[58:48.570 --> 58:50.290]  That's the one.
[58:50.290 --> 58:51.570]  But yeah, thank you guys for having me.
[58:51.570 --> 58:52.370]  I got to go.
[58:52.370 --> 58:54.010]  Amazing show.
[58:54.010 --> 58:54.570]  You guys killed it.
[58:54.570 --> 58:56.010]  I think you guys are going to continue on.
[58:56.010 --> 58:57.250]  Oh, forever.
[58:57.250 --> 58:57.930]  I think we're going on.
[58:57.930 --> 59:00.330]  I think it's an after, after, after.
[59:00.330 --> 59:02.690]  It's an after, after, after, after party going on here.
