[00:11.900 --> 00:15.660]  Yeah, I saw Tommy throwing them things backstage.
[00:15.660 --> 00:19.500]  Big ups everybody.
[00:19.500 --> 00:22.700]  Another episode of the Seed Collectors.
[00:22.700 --> 00:26.980]  And tonight we've got the one and only Tommy Tricones.
[00:26.980 --> 00:28.500]  What's up, buddy?
[00:28.500 --> 00:29.580]  What up, Chad?
[00:29.580 --> 00:30.700]  How you doing, buddy?
[00:30.700 --> 00:31.820]  Oh, I'm doing good.
[00:31.820 --> 00:32.500]  I'm chilling.
[00:32.500 --> 00:34.180]  I'm so glad you made it tonight.
[00:34.180 --> 00:34.860]  Oh, yeah.
[00:34.860 --> 00:38.740]  I'm never late for a podcast, you know?
[00:38.740 --> 00:39.900]  No, no.
[00:40.500 --> 00:44.620]  We were talking in the background.
[00:44.620 --> 00:45.820]  I'm like, you ready to go?
[00:45.820 --> 00:47.620]  And he straight up said, party on.
[00:47.620 --> 00:52.660]  I was like, get the fuck out of here now.
[00:52.660 --> 00:54.900]  I think I'm slowly graduating, though,
[00:54.900 --> 00:58.140]  from Wayne to Gandalf, though.
[00:58.140 --> 01:00.620]  I'm aspiring for more of a Gandalf these days.
[01:00.620 --> 01:01.700]  I mean, Garth.
[01:01.700 --> 01:02.660]  Garth is?
[01:02.660 --> 01:04.940]  Oh, I thought you were Garth.
[01:04.940 --> 01:06.900]  Yeah, I misspoke.
[01:06.900 --> 01:09.500]  I misspoke.
[01:09.500 --> 01:11.300]  Party on, bro.
[01:11.300 --> 01:12.780]  Party on, bro.
[01:12.780 --> 01:14.860]  Well, as you guys can see, we're already
[01:14.860 --> 01:16.700]  going to have a freaking awesome show.
[01:16.700 --> 01:19.780]  Dave, the co-host, he can't make it tonight
[01:19.780 --> 01:22.260]  because he spontaneously combusted
[01:22.260 --> 01:24.860]  with all the freaking stuff in his library.
[01:24.860 --> 01:27.260]  So he just burnt to a crisp.
[01:27.260 --> 01:29.420]  That is a danger of seed collecting, guys.
[01:29.420 --> 01:30.660]  So.
[01:30.660 --> 01:35.060]  He got wet feet coming up against this collection, baby.
[01:35.060 --> 01:36.380]  Boom.
[01:36.380 --> 01:37.340]  For sure.
[01:37.340 --> 01:38.740]  Shots fired, Dave.
[01:39.180 --> 01:41.180]  We don't miss you, buddy.
[01:41.180 --> 01:43.060]  I hope you're watching.
[01:43.060 --> 01:44.260]  Actually, I hope he's sleeping.
[01:44.260 --> 01:45.660]  He's really not feeling too well.
[01:45.660 --> 01:47.580]  So he'll be back on the next episode.
[01:47.580 --> 01:50.940]  But yeah, he's, dude, he would have
[01:50.940 --> 01:52.900]  had a formidable challenge this evening
[01:52.900 --> 01:55.940]  with Mr. Tommy Tricombs.
[01:55.940 --> 01:58.540]  You know, I always, you know, because T-shirts are easier
[01:58.540 --> 02:00.380]  for me to get than seeds right now.
[02:00.380 --> 02:02.980]  So I always start out the shows with T-shirts.
[02:02.980 --> 02:06.980]  This time, I've got a Bud and Lab, boom,
[02:07.020 --> 02:08.860]  Seattle Chronic over there.
[02:08.860 --> 02:10.540]  Bud and Lather.
[02:10.540 --> 02:14.060]  So Bud and Lather doesn't actually make cannabis,
[02:14.060 --> 02:16.820]  but they make like pretty cool soaps.
[02:16.820 --> 02:18.700]  Actually really cool soaps.
[02:18.700 --> 02:20.820]  They're infused, they smell good,
[02:20.820 --> 02:23.540]  and I actually use them myself.
[02:24.540 --> 02:28.540]  So he makes a really damn comfortable T-shirt too.
[02:28.540 --> 02:29.740]  So this thing always gets worn.
[02:29.740 --> 02:31.540]  I'm like, ah, what can I wear tonight?
[02:31.540 --> 02:33.980]  Bud and Lather shirt, easy choice.
[02:33.980 --> 02:35.140]  Seattle Chronic, man.
[02:35.140 --> 02:38.780]  He was on episode five of Seed Collectors.
[02:38.780 --> 02:39.620]  It was pretty good.
[02:39.620 --> 02:41.460]  Yeah, shout out to Lab.
[02:41.460 --> 02:43.100]  Shout out to Miss Chronic too.
[02:43.100 --> 02:44.940]  Hope they're doing good.
[02:44.940 --> 02:46.620]  Good people.
[02:46.620 --> 02:49.220]  Yeah, I've enjoyed following his work.
[02:49.220 --> 02:50.180]  And you know, a lot of his stuff,
[02:50.180 --> 02:52.900]  he's working with some of the minor cannabinoids as well,
[02:52.900 --> 02:56.500]  which I always applaud people going after that.
[02:57.820 --> 03:00.340]  It's a different direction than just pure THC.
[03:00.340 --> 03:03.620]  So it's fun to see people like dedicating
[03:03.860 --> 03:04.860]  some gross to that.
[03:04.860 --> 03:05.940]  And he's one of those people.
[03:05.940 --> 03:08.300]  So I dig it.
[03:08.300 --> 03:09.980]  He's blessed me with some cool cooks.
[03:09.980 --> 03:12.460]  I got his Melvins going right now.
[03:12.460 --> 03:13.500]  Nice, nice.
[03:13.500 --> 03:15.860]  Which was an awesome band from this area.
[03:15.860 --> 03:19.500]  The Melvins, Inspired Nirvana, Tad, all of that stuff.
[03:19.500 --> 03:21.980]  Good reference there.
[03:21.980 --> 03:23.340]  The grunge era, yep.
[03:23.340 --> 03:24.500]  Yeah, right.
[03:24.500 --> 03:25.340]  I came up with that too.
[03:25.340 --> 03:27.980]  I'm a hip hop kid, but I came up with that too.
[03:29.180 --> 03:32.220]  90s alternative and hip hop, baby.
[03:32.220 --> 03:34.260]  90s hip hop, not this new shit.
[03:35.460 --> 03:36.300]  The good stuff.
[03:36.300 --> 03:39.220]  Back when Illmatic was new, you're just like, woo.
[03:39.220 --> 03:44.220]  Yeah, that was the jam.
[03:44.340 --> 03:47.300]  So, you know, we're gonna be talking seeds.
[03:47.300 --> 03:49.220]  That's why, you know, people came.
[03:49.220 --> 03:50.940]  I've got some seeds here with me
[03:50.940 --> 03:52.660]  that I'm gonna be showing off too.
[03:52.660 --> 03:54.900]  Fuck, look at you.
[03:54.900 --> 03:55.740]  I like your...
[03:56.980 --> 03:58.820]  We're gonna be here for a while, folks.
[03:58.820 --> 03:59.900]  We're gonna be here.
[04:00.620 --> 04:02.420]  This is why he's saying Dave is scared.
[04:02.420 --> 04:03.860]  He said, it's snowing where Dave's at.
[04:03.860 --> 04:05.460]  There's no way he could have caught fire
[04:05.460 --> 04:07.660]  and just spontaneously combusted.
[04:07.660 --> 04:10.500]  But that's what we're saying.
[04:10.500 --> 04:12.740]  I wanted to start out though with something special.
[04:12.740 --> 04:16.500]  And you might actually recognize this one
[04:16.500 --> 04:19.060]  because this came from you.
[04:19.060 --> 04:23.980]  This was a giveaway that you did on Eagle Gardens,
[04:23.980 --> 04:25.740]  the fucking talking shit with the Eagle Garden show.
[04:25.740 --> 04:28.380]  You did some giveaways and this was one of them.
[04:28.380 --> 04:31.980]  And, you know, I've been wanting mimosa
[04:31.980 --> 04:34.820]  or something like a mimosa for so long.
[04:34.820 --> 04:36.140]  And this happened to be, you know,
[04:36.140 --> 04:38.180]  I think you did like five or six giveaways that night.
[04:38.180 --> 04:41.240]  But the one that I actually won was this one.
[04:42.620 --> 04:43.980]  So I'm very stoked.
[04:43.980 --> 04:46.700]  So again, yeah, so it's called Sunday Funday,
[04:46.700 --> 04:49.300]  which is a little misleading
[04:49.300 --> 04:52.060]  because there's another strain called Sunday Funday
[04:52.060 --> 04:53.220]  out there as well.
[04:54.180 --> 04:55.900]  But this is a sour tangy.
[04:56.780 --> 04:59.500]  Focus, yeah, I'm an ace.
[05:00.420 --> 05:02.620]  Sour tangy times mimosa.
[05:02.620 --> 05:05.460]  And this actually I've got about three of them left
[05:05.460 --> 05:06.720]  because it was a 12 pack.
[05:06.720 --> 05:08.340]  I always say I save two,
[05:08.340 --> 05:10.440]  but if I get a 12 pack, I save three.
[05:11.660 --> 05:13.460]  But this I actually pulled a mail from
[05:13.460 --> 05:17.520]  that I was really impressed with and used.
[05:17.520 --> 05:19.540]  So thank you, Tommy.
[05:20.420 --> 05:24.340]  This one's come full circle and this lives up to its name,
[05:24.340 --> 05:25.540]  man, it had a bunch of flavor.
[05:26.180 --> 05:29.300]  It was a little bit on the taller side,
[05:29.300 --> 05:30.940]  a little more internodal spacing,
[05:30.940 --> 05:34.540]  but not unreasonable to where I didn't wanna grow it again.
[05:35.820 --> 05:38.020]  But yeah, excellent profile on it.
[05:38.020 --> 05:41.460]  And it's part of the Nakatomi Plaza.
[05:41.460 --> 05:44.620]  So I'm doing another test run right now of that.
[05:45.540 --> 05:46.660]  And we'll see how it turns out.
[05:46.660 --> 05:48.380]  But yeah, thank you, man.
[05:48.380 --> 05:50.380]  Full circle, big ups.
[05:50.380 --> 05:52.060]  Yeah, that's what's up for sure.
[05:52.140 --> 05:55.940]  I like to, I don't know, shout out to Eagle.
[05:55.940 --> 05:57.700]  I haven't been on Eagle's show in a while.
[05:57.700 --> 06:01.180]  It's so late at night and having kids instead of-
[06:01.180 --> 06:04.020]  Right, yeah, especially, you know,
[06:04.020 --> 06:05.900]  I'm on the West Coast and I complain
[06:05.900 --> 06:07.820]  that he messed up my sleep schedule.
[06:07.820 --> 06:10.580]  So I don't even know about living like on the East Coast.
[06:10.580 --> 06:13.020]  That'd be a whole nother story.
[06:13.020 --> 06:16.180]  Sometimes they're still on air when I'm waking up,
[06:16.180 --> 06:17.620]  you know, so it's like, oh.
[06:18.140 --> 06:18.980]  Right.
[06:20.980 --> 06:21.820]  Yeah, so-
[06:21.820 --> 06:22.780]  That's my problem.
[06:22.780 --> 06:23.620]  Oh, I'm sorry, go ahead.
[06:23.620 --> 06:25.740]  No, no, you go, go for it, man.
[06:25.740 --> 06:27.580]  I was just gonna ask the Googueters.
[06:29.100 --> 06:31.620]  Do you know like maybe where you picked these up
[06:31.620 --> 06:34.340]  or how they came to you or anything about Googueters?
[06:34.340 --> 06:37.140]  I found like a Facebook page,
[06:37.140 --> 06:38.500]  a little bit of information
[06:38.500 --> 06:41.380]  about this particular strain from them.
[06:41.380 --> 06:43.300]  But were they someone from your area
[06:43.300 --> 06:44.660]  or how did that come about?
[06:45.620 --> 06:46.940]  I don't know.
[06:49.420 --> 06:50.740]  So my old lady,
[06:50.740 --> 06:54.860]  she used to always make like Sunday fun day posts.
[06:54.860 --> 06:59.860]  Shout out to Green Queen, it was her name on IG.
[06:59.980 --> 07:02.900]  And she used to always make like a Sunday fun day post
[07:02.900 --> 07:04.940]  and I believe they put those in her hands
[07:04.940 --> 07:07.100]  and then she put them in my hands.
[07:07.100 --> 07:08.260]  That's awesome.
[07:08.260 --> 07:10.660]  Okay, so there's the secret of the name.
[07:10.660 --> 07:11.500]  Sunday fun day.
[07:11.500 --> 07:13.980]  Sunday fun day is as fun as Taco Tuesdays.
[07:13.980 --> 07:14.820]  Right, right.
[07:14.820 --> 07:18.700]  Yeah, shout out to, what'd you say, Sunday?
[07:19.660 --> 07:21.260]  I got some of these going right now.
[07:21.260 --> 07:24.460]  Sundial from Smiley.
[07:24.460 --> 07:27.060]  Hey, there we go, Smiley's Angels.
[07:27.060 --> 07:27.900]  Yeah.
[07:27.900 --> 07:29.620]  Kaboom.
[07:29.620 --> 07:33.420]  Yeah, I'm not, I got,
[07:34.340 --> 07:37.460]  I like when I know the person or I meet the person
[07:37.460 --> 07:39.100]  and then I get the seeds, you know?
[07:39.100 --> 07:40.500]  I'm a big fan of that.
[07:40.540 --> 07:43.980]  I'm a big fan of getting the packs
[07:43.980 --> 07:47.140]  where it's just someone's handwriting, you know?
[07:47.140 --> 07:50.020]  And it's, hey, this is, you know what I mean?
[07:50.020 --> 07:50.860]  More of the-
[07:52.780 --> 07:54.700]  This is pretty much have been my sticker
[07:54.700 --> 07:56.700]  for the last few years.
[07:56.700 --> 07:58.140]  So yeah.
[07:58.140 --> 07:58.980]  You're right, right.
[07:58.980 --> 08:00.180]  Those are my stickers.
[08:00.180 --> 08:02.060]  Yeah, these work really good.
[08:02.060 --> 08:04.500]  These, damn, I gotta stop doing that.
[08:04.500 --> 08:06.340]  Everything's backwards, right?
[08:06.340 --> 08:07.180]  Yeah.
[08:07.180 --> 08:09.780]  That's Skywalker to the Rambo breath.
[08:09.780 --> 08:13.100]  Rambo breath is like my breeding namesake
[08:13.100 --> 08:17.980]  that's my first successful kind of a breeding project.
[08:17.980 --> 08:20.020]  That's Ambrosia.
[08:21.180 --> 08:22.140]  Yeah, it'd be that.
[08:22.140 --> 08:24.580]  Well, Ambrosia was the male side of it.
[08:24.580 --> 08:25.420]  Okay.
[08:25.420 --> 08:27.300]  Times OG, Cush breath.
[08:27.300 --> 08:28.300]  Okay.
[08:28.300 --> 08:32.820]  That, you know, the whole breath thing, I've enjoyed.
[08:32.820 --> 08:35.980]  Motor breath 15 has hit out here, you know,
[08:35.980 --> 08:37.540]  a couple of years ago.
[08:37.620 --> 08:39.020]  But it seemed like, you know,
[08:39.020 --> 08:41.060]  obviously Thug Pug, I think had the-
[08:42.380 --> 08:43.380]  You know, Butterfrog.
[08:43.380 --> 08:44.220]  I forget.
[08:44.220 --> 08:45.700]  Yeah, I forget what breath it was,
[08:45.700 --> 08:47.980]  but then there's been a ton of them,
[08:47.980 --> 08:50.340]  but it seems like that almost hit like,
[08:50.340 --> 08:54.420]  and GMO too, like those were banging over like in Michigan.
[08:54.420 --> 08:57.220]  And then it took a couple of years to hit the West Coast,
[08:57.220 --> 08:58.060]  which is funny,
[08:58.060 --> 09:00.620]  because it usually travels like the other way,
[09:00.620 --> 09:02.580]  but you guys have had a leg up
[09:02.580 --> 09:04.780]  on a lot of the breath stuff.
[09:04.780 --> 09:05.860]  Yeah, the,
[09:07.300 --> 09:10.540]  shout out to Thug Pug, Gromer.
[09:12.460 --> 09:13.780]  That peanut butter breath,
[09:15.260 --> 09:17.940]  I mean, I actually running, what is it called?
[09:17.940 --> 09:21.460]  Double Butter, which is from Fresh Coast.
[09:21.460 --> 09:23.660]  So that's like peanut butter breath
[09:23.660 --> 09:24.780]  times peanut butter breath.
[09:24.780 --> 09:27.020]  That's his take on it or whatever.
[09:27.020 --> 09:29.820]  But what was it?
[09:29.820 --> 09:30.940]  Yeah, it's just like,
[09:30.940 --> 09:33.340]  I've seen like Dave could speak to this.
[09:33.340 --> 09:35.220]  That's how I actually kind of know Dave
[09:35.220 --> 09:36.940]  is from the auction scene.
[09:36.940 --> 09:37.780]  Okay.
[09:37.780 --> 09:39.940]  And sometimes you see them packs just go for,
[09:41.140 --> 09:41.980]  you know what I'm saying?
[09:41.980 --> 09:42.980]  Like a pretty penny.
[09:42.980 --> 09:44.300]  It's kind of crazy.
[09:44.300 --> 09:47.340]  I'm big on the charity auctions and stuff.
[09:47.340 --> 09:49.460]  I do, I'd like to,
[09:49.460 --> 09:52.980]  I'd like to score a lot of my seeds in things like that.
[09:52.980 --> 09:57.020]  Or like I said, in person with somebody or, you know.
[09:59.540 --> 10:02.860]  I'm not the biggest sit there and wait for the drop.
[10:03.500 --> 10:07.020]  For the cool stuff and sit in line and hope I get them
[10:07.020 --> 10:12.020]  or never been that kind of standing in the calculator line.
[10:14.100 --> 10:15.020]  Standing in the queue.
[10:15.020 --> 10:15.860]  Oh yeah, definitely.
[10:15.860 --> 10:19.060]  I see those lines, man.
[10:19.060 --> 10:20.540]  And that's awesome.
[10:20.540 --> 10:22.380]  Cause that's something that I always like to ask people
[10:22.380 --> 10:24.580]  is like, how do you come about them?
[10:24.580 --> 10:27.820]  And that's a really fun thing about this community too.
[10:27.820 --> 10:30.100]  There's a lot of sharing that goes on.
[10:30.100 --> 10:31.380]  Smiley has been generous
[10:31.380 --> 10:32.820]  and has sent me stuff in the past.
[10:33.780 --> 10:35.380]  Before he had the cool stickers.
[10:37.220 --> 10:38.700]  Smiley's angel, shut up.
[10:40.740 --> 10:41.740]  Smiley's a great dude.
[10:41.740 --> 10:42.980]  I know him personally.
[10:42.980 --> 10:46.740]  I see him, you know, here and there.
[10:46.740 --> 10:48.060]  Where I live in Michigan,
[10:48.060 --> 10:51.540]  it's like I don't live in Michigan.
[10:51.540 --> 10:52.380]  You know what I mean?
[10:52.380 --> 10:56.140]  So I only get to see the Michigan crew when it's,
[10:57.980 --> 10:58.860]  at events and stuff.
[10:58.860 --> 11:00.900]  No one ever comes down here to see me.
[11:00.900 --> 11:04.580]  Oh, Tommy, we gotta change that, man.
[11:04.580 --> 11:06.340]  I'm basically living in Indiana.
[11:06.340 --> 11:11.100]  So I'm a border, I'm right on the borders.
[11:11.100 --> 11:14.420]  I used to live in Holland way, way, way back.
[11:14.420 --> 11:16.820]  So that was right on Lake McIntyre
[11:16.820 --> 11:17.860]  goes into Lake Michigan.
[11:17.860 --> 11:18.900]  That's where I was.
[11:18.900 --> 11:21.420]  Yeah, I mean, that's still far from me.
[11:21.420 --> 11:22.860]  You know, that's the West side.
[11:22.860 --> 11:25.220]  That's the far West side, but yeah.
[11:25.220 --> 11:28.260]  If you go into a Cubs game, come and see me, right?
[11:29.100 --> 11:31.100]  Not even, oh, oh, damn.
[11:34.460 --> 11:35.980]  There's a ton of Cubs fans out here.
[11:35.980 --> 11:36.900]  Drives me crazy.
[11:36.900 --> 11:38.140]  Like, all right.
[11:38.140 --> 11:38.980]  I mean, whatever.
[11:38.980 --> 11:40.260]  Congratulations to the Cubs.
[11:40.260 --> 11:41.740]  That was a great World Series,
[11:41.740 --> 11:44.580]  but I'm still kind of bitter about that one.
[11:44.580 --> 11:46.780]  Dude, you see all this gray though.
[11:46.780 --> 11:49.420]  I waited my entire life to watch them.
[11:49.420 --> 11:50.660]  Cause I was young when I lived there.
[11:50.660 --> 11:51.980]  So that's like my first memories
[11:51.980 --> 11:56.580]  of like a professional baseball game was Wrigley Field.
[11:56.580 --> 12:00.540]  So yeah, I feel like I need a wardrobe change
[12:00.540 --> 12:01.740]  and go grab my Cubbies hat,
[12:01.740 --> 12:05.780]  but we'll let it slide, Mr. Cleveland, Mr. Drew Carey.
[12:07.420 --> 12:08.500]  Yeah, Drew Carey.
[12:08.500 --> 12:11.500]  That mother fucker changed, hasn't he?
[12:16.940 --> 12:19.260]  He may or may not own a majority stake
[12:19.260 --> 12:22.140]  in one of the large, large grows out here in Washington.
[12:22.140 --> 12:22.980]  Silent Park.
[12:22.980 --> 12:23.820]  Oh yeah.
[12:23.820 --> 12:25.380]  Yeah, you have that.
[12:25.380 --> 12:26.220]  What's his name?
[12:27.820 --> 12:28.660]  How's his name?
[12:28.660 --> 12:29.740]  Calvin Johnson Megatron.
[12:29.740 --> 12:30.580]  He owns a,
[12:34.220 --> 12:36.780]  you know, at least he's the guy everyone knows.
[12:36.780 --> 12:40.500]  Yeah, you put a face on it.
[12:40.500 --> 12:44.260]  Yeah, I don't really dabble in the dispo game
[12:44.260 --> 12:45.300]  or any of that.
[12:45.300 --> 12:47.300]  I mean, kind of like the,
[12:49.860 --> 12:51.500]  I've been known to talk shit.
[12:52.500 --> 12:53.940]  You never.
[12:54.900 --> 12:55.740]  Never.
[12:55.740 --> 12:59.900]  Yeah, I support the home grow and anyone,
[12:59.900 --> 13:00.740]  you know what I mean?
[13:00.740 --> 13:03.380]  I'm not about this trying to run the little guy
[13:03.380 --> 13:05.420]  out of the game and yada, yada, yada.
[13:05.420 --> 13:07.700]  That's just, it's a shame.
[13:07.700 --> 13:09.620]  You know, it's a big enough industry
[13:09.620 --> 13:11.860]  for everyone to be able to get a piece
[13:11.860 --> 13:16.860]  and for these big guys to lobby against the small guys,
[13:16.860 --> 13:21.860]  kind of, you know, kind of not right in my eyes.
[13:21.940 --> 13:23.700]  It's unnecessary, damn it.
[13:24.460 --> 13:25.780]  That's the game, you know what I'm saying?
[13:25.780 --> 13:27.700]  If they tell me I can't do it, I'm still gonna do it.
[13:27.700 --> 13:28.540]  I know.
[13:28.540 --> 13:31.220]  It's like, why are you scared, homie?
[13:31.220 --> 13:32.620]  Why are you scared, homie?
[13:33.860 --> 13:36.340]  For real, it's like, we're just a small craft grow.
[13:36.340 --> 13:37.180]  What are we gonna do?
[13:37.180 --> 13:38.980]  Put you out of business, Hawthorne?
[13:38.980 --> 13:41.500]  No, I don't think so, but why are you scared?
[13:41.500 --> 13:42.900]  Why are you scared?
[13:42.900 --> 13:44.940]  Yeah, I might still be a little bit bitter.
[13:44.940 --> 13:49.940]  I actually had a terrible business opportunity
[13:50.220 --> 13:52.100]  that kind of just all blew up in my face.
[13:52.540 --> 13:55.260]  I just, nothing I did with court.
[13:55.260 --> 13:59.220]  But a lot of the, no offense,
[13:59.220 --> 14:02.500]  but the Chads and the Brads,
[14:03.340 --> 14:06.260]  the Chads and the Brads and the lawyers and the realtors.
[14:08.540 --> 14:10.780]  But now that it all played, you know,
[14:10.780 --> 14:13.460]  a couple of years ago that that all didn't work out,
[14:13.460 --> 14:16.340]  and I'm just kind of, I'm happy to be where I'm at.
[14:18.020 --> 14:21.060]  You know, it's not all about that.
[14:23.100 --> 14:26.020]  That didn't air ho, you know what I mean?
[14:26.020 --> 14:29.580]  It's more about just the lifestyle to me.
[14:29.580 --> 14:32.060]  Yeah, and it's not over yet either, man.
[14:32.060 --> 14:34.060]  You gained a lot of valuable experience,
[14:34.060 --> 14:35.180]  even though it was shitty.
[14:35.180 --> 14:38.420]  It was a lot of valuable experience that might help you
[14:38.420 --> 14:41.220]  or probably even somebody else in the future.
[14:41.220 --> 14:42.700]  But like you said, just kind of doing it
[14:42.700 --> 14:45.340]  and keeping it from the people that you know.
[14:45.340 --> 14:48.940]  There's a lot of really, really good growers
[14:48.940 --> 14:52.080]  and breeders out there that nobody's heard about.
[14:53.040 --> 14:55.360]  So sometimes like, you know, like Smiley as an example,
[14:55.360 --> 14:56.520]  we've all seen him grow.
[14:56.520 --> 14:57.840]  We know he's been around the plant.
[14:57.840 --> 15:00.560]  We know he has decent selections.
[15:00.560 --> 15:02.160]  You never know what you're gonna get
[15:02.160 --> 15:05.640]  from some of these people that aren't, you know, burner,
[15:05.640 --> 15:07.760]  because I have to say his name every episode.
[15:07.760 --> 15:08.960]  I get paid, guys.
[15:08.960 --> 15:09.920]  I really love cookies.
[15:09.920 --> 15:12.760]  They pay me $2 every time I say the word cookies.
[15:12.760 --> 15:13.600]  Yeah, we know.
[15:13.600 --> 15:15.120]  We know that's the real.
[15:16.720 --> 15:19.440]  He's like any publicity is good publicity.
[15:19.440 --> 15:21.640]  Pretty much, pretty much.
[15:22.480 --> 15:24.440]  Let's see, I saw Highlander here.
[15:24.440 --> 15:28.360]  He threw in your root beer freeze came in the mail today.
[15:28.360 --> 15:32.100]  So root beer, root beer has been the craze
[15:32.100 --> 15:33.520]  over the last little while.
[15:33.520 --> 15:36.540]  I know Dave is a big root beer collector.
[15:37.960 --> 15:39.840]  Brian's like, oh, I can't wait for the,
[15:39.840 --> 15:41.720]  ooh, root beer and hazes.
[15:41.720 --> 15:43.620]  Good choices, my man.
[15:45.320 --> 15:47.720]  Have you picked up anything on the root beer tip?
[15:47.720 --> 15:49.200]  Oh, schnapps.
[15:49.200 --> 15:51.780]  This is the Soto project, yeah.
[15:52.960 --> 15:54.160]  I still got some of these too.
[15:54.160 --> 15:56.800]  I actually ran, I just ran a bunch of these.
[15:56.800 --> 15:59.120]  Oh, that's a lot of seeds in there.
[15:59.120 --> 16:03.920]  Yeah, so this we got at the Regenerative Conference
[16:03.920 --> 16:06.260]  about a year ago here in Michigan.
[16:07.520 --> 16:08.500]  I don't know if you're familiar
[16:08.500 --> 16:11.320]  with what Dutch Blooms was doing with that,
[16:11.320 --> 16:14.880]  but basically part of, I guess,
[16:14.880 --> 16:18.480]  your, you know, your admission to the conference,
[16:18.480 --> 16:20.120]  everyone got those seeds.
[16:20.120 --> 16:23.160]  It's the chem dog special reserve
[16:23.160 --> 16:25.380]  times the original root beer.
[16:25.380 --> 16:26.880]  I think the original root beer,
[16:26.880 --> 16:28.840]  according to this was a bit of a female
[16:29.680 --> 16:31.240]  and that chem dog special reserve
[16:31.240 --> 16:34.480]  is out of Joe Dries collection.
[16:34.480 --> 16:36.040]  Nice.
[16:36.040 --> 16:39.360]  I ran about 10 or 12 of these.
[16:39.360 --> 16:41.720]  And recently I actually haven't,
[16:42.760 --> 16:45.060]  it's still hanging on the rack right now.
[16:45.060 --> 16:48.100]  Okay, how did they, were they a super long one?
[16:48.720 --> 16:50.260]  Was it like a nine week or 10 week
[16:50.260 --> 16:51.860]  or was there anything that like stood out
[16:51.860 --> 16:53.620]  about the grow to you?
[16:53.620 --> 16:57.220]  Yeah, they seemed a little bit on the longer side.
[16:57.220 --> 17:00.180]  I mean, most of my stuff I try to average in around,
[17:00.180 --> 17:03.140]  you know, we'll say like nine weeks, you know.
[17:03.140 --> 17:06.660]  Give or take just to keep with the flow of,
[17:06.660 --> 17:07.660]  the flow of everything.
[17:07.660 --> 17:10.620]  And I pulled those at about 10 weeks
[17:10.620 --> 17:12.140]  and they looked like they could have probably
[17:12.140 --> 17:14.220]  used another week, week and a half.
[17:14.220 --> 17:17.380]  So we'll see.
[17:17.820 --> 17:20.820]  I do have one that I definitely tagged
[17:20.820 --> 17:22.460]  and kept in the notes.
[17:22.460 --> 17:25.460]  It's kind of like the earlier finisher.
[17:25.460 --> 17:26.300]  Okay.
[17:26.300 --> 17:27.120]  It's got that,
[17:28.860 --> 17:29.700]  it's got that chem,
[17:29.700 --> 17:32.460]  I didn't get much like root beer out of it.
[17:33.420 --> 17:36.980]  It does have some definitely like some chem dog,
[17:36.980 --> 17:40.620]  you know, reminds me some of the chem and all that.
[17:41.940 --> 17:43.220]  That's some of my favorite stuff.
[17:43.220 --> 17:45.380]  Like chem 91 is one of my favorites
[17:45.380 --> 17:50.060]  and it has a specific taste, you know.
[17:50.060 --> 17:51.380]  And if you haven't tasted it,
[17:51.380 --> 17:54.060]  I say like, you know, Gorilla Glue 4.
[17:54.060 --> 17:56.900]  Gorilla Glue 4 is Gorilla Glue 4.
[17:56.900 --> 17:58.460]  You know, if you have it or you don't.
[17:58.460 --> 17:59.980]  So people recognize that,
[17:59.980 --> 18:01.220]  that's kind of what I'm talking about.
[18:01.220 --> 18:03.660]  It's like, it's that distinguishable when you got it,
[18:03.660 --> 18:06.300]  you're just like, yeah, okay.
[18:06.300 --> 18:09.340]  The root beer I've heard, you know,
[18:09.340 --> 18:12.060]  Mean Genes say that it is kind of elusive,
[18:12.060 --> 18:14.820]  like it's there, but it can be elusive.
[18:15.260 --> 18:17.040]  So it's really kind of a matter of numbers,
[18:17.040 --> 18:19.980]  but I, you know, I'm trying to look for it too.
[18:19.980 --> 18:24.060]  I got some of the burgers and beer,
[18:24.060 --> 18:28.820]  which actually just got re-released from the ranch.
[18:29.740 --> 18:33.140]  He put these out last year
[18:33.140 --> 18:35.520]  and I got a couple of packs from him on that one.
[18:35.520 --> 18:36.980]  So Donnie Burger, there we go.
[18:36.980 --> 18:39.140]  So GMO times Larry OG,
[18:39.140 --> 18:40.820]  that was the Donnie Burger times the root beer,
[18:40.820 --> 18:42.220]  back cross two.
[18:42.220 --> 18:44.600]  And that was, he sourced these directly from,
[18:45.380 --> 18:48.960]  I think it was Skunk Tech and then Mean Gene here.
[18:50.960 --> 18:53.560]  So yeah, no, I've heard of those.
[18:53.560 --> 18:55.800]  I've run the Donnie Burger.
[18:55.800 --> 18:59.600]  I've had a good cut that I was running for a while
[18:59.600 --> 19:00.920]  of the Donnie Burger.
[19:02.040 --> 19:03.640]  One thing I will say about the root beer
[19:03.640 --> 19:06.620]  and Mean Gene has also said this,
[19:06.620 --> 19:07.800]  is it's more like,
[19:09.520 --> 19:14.040]  it's a better for like an outdoor kind of situation.
[19:14.040 --> 19:17.840]  And there is some,
[19:17.840 --> 19:19.720]  at least with the like original root beers,
[19:19.720 --> 19:22.320]  there are some possibilities of some herbs
[19:22.320 --> 19:23.160]  and this and that.
[19:23.160 --> 19:25.040]  So that's coming from him.
[19:25.040 --> 19:26.600]  I'm not saying like I friend a bunch
[19:26.600 --> 19:29.000]  and has a drink or anything like that.
[19:29.000 --> 19:31.040]  So that kind of scared me away.
[19:31.040 --> 19:34.000]  Plus I've, shout out to Dave again,
[19:34.000 --> 19:36.040]  but you know, me and him,
[19:36.040 --> 19:37.320]  some of these auctions,
[19:40.040 --> 19:42.400]  like, oh my God, like it was just exciting.
[19:42.400 --> 19:44.000]  I was like, okay, like I'm out.
[19:44.840 --> 19:46.760]  I'm gonna do like 300 and then it's like,
[19:47.880 --> 19:50.040]  oh shit, I love watching people duke it out.
[19:50.040 --> 19:50.880]  You know what I mean?
[19:50.880 --> 19:52.080]  Especially when it gets up to like a grand
[19:52.080 --> 19:54.280]  for a pack of seeds, it's like, oh shit.
[19:55.360 --> 19:58.520]  And I've seen your name involved in a few four digit bids.
[19:58.520 --> 19:59.360]  Oh yeah, yeah.
[19:59.360 --> 20:00.880]  Not to put your business out there.
[20:00.880 --> 20:01.720]  I didn't say that.
[20:01.720 --> 20:06.720]  I've been in there, but I got a good story speaking of that.
[20:07.800 --> 20:09.320]  So this whole bag right here,
[20:11.320 --> 20:12.960]  I'll pull out some stuff that's in here,
[20:12.960 --> 20:17.680]  but Dutch Blooms is doing an auction,
[20:17.680 --> 20:20.320]  just kind of like clearing his vault.
[20:20.320 --> 20:23.240]  He was actually trying to fund buying a pizza oven,
[20:23.240 --> 20:24.880]  which he did successfully.
[20:24.880 --> 20:26.560]  He got, I believe he's putting it
[20:26.560 --> 20:28.600]  in the back of a school bus.
[20:28.600 --> 20:30.040]  He'd take to events and stuff.
[20:30.040 --> 20:33.320]  So he's got like a hardwood fire kind of pizza oven,
[20:33.320 --> 20:34.160]  I guess.
[20:34.160 --> 20:35.000]  Yep.
[20:35.000 --> 20:40.000]  And the auction was going on and he was like,
[20:40.520 --> 20:41.360]  it was crazy.
[20:41.360 --> 20:43.040]  I'll just put a bunch of seeds in this bag.
[20:43.040 --> 20:44.800]  He would show some packs and throw some seeds in it.
[20:44.800 --> 20:46.960]  Like bags like this, right?
[20:46.960 --> 20:51.480]  And I was like, I'm like thinking like,
[20:51.480 --> 20:53.040]  oh, it's like Dave's not here.
[20:53.040 --> 20:53.880]  Like.
[20:53.880 --> 20:57.600]  I'm like, hell yes.
[20:57.600 --> 21:02.120]  So once I won mine, once I won my big bundle,
[21:02.120 --> 21:04.080]  then I did have the hard, I was like,
[21:04.080 --> 21:05.080]  Dave, you got to get in here.
[21:05.080 --> 21:06.240]  He's like, dude, I'm in the work.
[21:06.240 --> 21:08.400]  I'm like, I'm trying to get in there.
[21:08.400 --> 21:10.240]  But I did, I did have to put up the work
[21:10.280 --> 21:12.240]  because I know he's always up for a good auction.
[21:12.240 --> 21:14.440]  Plus he doesn't, you know, it's for a good cause.
[21:14.440 --> 21:15.280]  You know what I'm saying?
[21:15.280 --> 21:17.080]  When these auctions and stuff,
[21:17.080 --> 21:18.800]  and Dave is always there for those.
[21:18.800 --> 21:20.800]  And he's one of the guys you don't want to see.
[21:20.800 --> 21:24.040]  You see Masonic pop in like, oh God, you know,
[21:24.040 --> 21:25.200]  if Masonic wants it.
[21:25.200 --> 21:26.800]  And there's a couple other guys.
[21:27.600 --> 21:28.440]  You know what I mean?
[21:28.440 --> 21:31.720]  That's just like, oh shit, like, yeah, this guy's bidding.
[21:31.720 --> 21:34.360]  Like, you know, I got to watch myself here
[21:34.360 --> 21:37.120]  before I go, you know, break the bank.
[21:37.120 --> 21:37.960]  Yeah.
[21:38.480 --> 21:40.880]  There was like a golden era of those auctions
[21:40.880 --> 21:44.040]  during the pandemic or whatever.
[21:44.040 --> 21:46.920]  So it was kind of a crazy time where it was like,
[21:47.920 --> 21:49.040]  where's my good stuff?
[21:51.040 --> 21:53.680]  I just got a whole bunch of money.
[21:56.800 --> 21:59.920]  I've seen Nick Risen.
[21:59.920 --> 22:00.760]  Yeah.
[22:00.760 --> 22:03.240]  As well, just like stuff a bag.
[22:03.240 --> 22:04.160]  Just stuff a bag.
[22:04.160 --> 22:05.200]  He's like, all right guys.
[22:05.200 --> 22:06.200]  And like you said, man,
[22:06.200 --> 22:09.000]  these are all for like charity auctions.
[22:09.000 --> 22:10.920]  So they're benefiting somebody,
[22:10.920 --> 22:13.800]  which is great to see, you know, bids.
[22:13.800 --> 22:18.240]  Lately it's packs have almost been going under price.
[22:18.240 --> 22:20.320]  The work, yeah, the work.
[22:21.200 --> 22:25.600]  One thing with Nick is, I mean, I have,
[22:25.600 --> 22:27.800]  shit, I have basically probably every pack
[22:27.800 --> 22:29.360]  that, you know, he's released.
[22:29.360 --> 22:32.000]  And being a friend of mine, I really don't have to,
[22:32.000 --> 22:33.640]  you know, I'm not trying to rub it in,
[22:33.640 --> 22:35.720]  but I usually don't have to pay for it.
[22:36.400 --> 22:39.240]  I got the Chelsea, which the Chelsea I'm still running.
[22:39.240 --> 22:42.480]  I have a really good selection of mine.
[22:44.120 --> 22:45.880]  So what is the Chelsea about?
[22:45.880 --> 22:48.000]  Like I've not heard of it.
[22:48.000 --> 22:50.680]  How does it grow or what is the profile?
[22:50.680 --> 22:53.480]  Like what is your attraction to Chelsea?
[22:53.480 --> 22:54.840]  And I won't tell your lady.
[22:54.840 --> 22:58.120]  Well, it's, what is it?
[22:58.120 --> 23:02.400]  It's the Pam times Hollywood pure Kush.
[23:02.440 --> 23:07.440]  And the Pam is from a family tree seeds, right?
[23:07.520 --> 23:08.520]  The Pam Anderson.
[23:08.520 --> 23:09.360]  Yep, yep.
[23:10.640 --> 23:13.840]  So that one, even when it went into,
[23:13.840 --> 23:14.680]  what is it called?
[23:14.680 --> 23:16.200]  Phylos or whatever.
[23:16.200 --> 23:19.680]  It was like marked as something that was not like related
[23:19.680 --> 23:21.640]  to any of the other shit.
[23:21.640 --> 23:23.160]  Way out there on the galaxy.
[23:23.160 --> 23:24.680]  Way out there on the galaxy.
[23:24.680 --> 23:26.440]  A good way to put it.
[23:26.440 --> 23:28.880]  So that, and I believe he got that out
[23:28.880 --> 23:30.880]  like a nineties bag seat or something.
[23:31.680 --> 23:33.920]  And then you put that to the Hollywood pure Kush,
[23:33.920 --> 23:36.320]  which is a solid.
[23:36.320 --> 23:38.560]  Yeah, I have the cut.
[23:38.560 --> 23:42.720]  I got from Mr. Toad a while back in one of the auctions.
[23:42.720 --> 23:46.360]  Like that's actually how I got to cut.
[23:46.360 --> 23:49.640]  You know, I've never met Tony in person,
[23:49.640 --> 23:52.640]  but you know, we have a pretty good relationship
[23:52.640 --> 23:56.760]  doing hopping on the podcast and chit chatting on Instagram
[23:56.760 --> 23:57.600]  and all that stuff.
[23:58.400 --> 23:59.840]  Shout out to Mr. Toad.
[23:59.840 --> 24:03.040]  Very, very much a mad respect to that guy
[24:03.040 --> 24:04.920]  for everything he does for the community
[24:04.920 --> 24:08.800]  and just mad props on being a great human being
[24:08.800 --> 24:10.200]  and all that stuff.
[24:10.200 --> 24:12.160]  That guy, that guy.
[24:12.160 --> 24:15.000]  Yeah, he gets out a lot of genetics to a lot of people
[24:15.000 --> 24:18.640]  that can really benefit from cannabis,
[24:18.640 --> 24:22.120]  let alone having like really good strains.
[24:22.120 --> 24:23.360]  His work is good.
[24:23.360 --> 24:25.000]  I've grown his work myself.
[24:25.000 --> 24:27.120]  I definitely have a bunch right here.
[24:27.640 --> 24:28.640]  All right, all right.
[24:28.640 --> 24:31.000]  Let's see if we can go fish.
[24:31.000 --> 24:32.400]  Let's play go fish.
[24:32.400 --> 24:33.240]  All right.
[24:34.560 --> 24:37.480]  Can I get a ghost of Mary Jane?
[24:37.480 --> 24:39.520]  Can I get a ghost of Mary Jane?
[24:39.520 --> 24:41.240]  Oh shit, you might get me on the first one.
[24:41.240 --> 24:43.360]  Ghost OG times space cheese,
[24:43.360 --> 24:47.480]  AKA Mr. From Down or Mr. From Under.
[24:50.080 --> 24:51.400]  Can I get a ghost of Mary Jane?
[24:51.400 --> 24:52.560]  You got a 44 pack?
[24:52.560 --> 24:54.600]  No, but I'll see that now.
[24:54.600 --> 24:55.440]  Let's see.
[24:55.440 --> 24:58.360]  All right, track one from you guys in chat.
[24:58.360 --> 25:01.160]  I got the untested one, PMF2.
[25:02.360 --> 25:05.240]  Timespace cheese, so that's untested.
[25:05.240 --> 25:07.880]  You get a personal handwritten Cleveland
[25:07.880 --> 25:12.880]  on your 44 pack of, that's a one hitter quitter.
[25:13.800 --> 25:15.920]  That's another special little thing me and Tony have.
[25:15.920 --> 25:17.280]  He's a Cleveland Browns fan.
[25:17.280 --> 25:21.280]  So anyone that's a Cleveland Browns fan.
[25:21.280 --> 25:23.600]  He did, I did have a one hitter quitter.
[25:23.600 --> 25:26.560]  Actually, I took a few out for myself,
[25:26.560 --> 25:31.360]  but a veteran in need contacted me.
[25:31.360 --> 25:32.480]  They needed some seeds.
[25:32.480 --> 25:33.780]  They were looking for something heavy.
[25:33.780 --> 25:35.920]  They were looking for something narcotic.
[25:35.920 --> 25:37.500]  I said, I've got what you need.
[25:37.500 --> 25:39.080]  So I sent, I sent them this.
[25:39.080 --> 25:40.160]  So, so, okay.
[25:40.160 --> 25:42.440]  I do got a little bit of the one hitter quitter here.
[25:42.440 --> 25:44.500]  This, see, this is again, this is how I do my writing.
[25:44.500 --> 25:46.200]  But I sent him the pack.
[25:46.200 --> 25:48.040]  Cause you know, people like to collect packs.
[25:48.040 --> 25:49.120]  So I'm just like, all right,
[25:49.120 --> 25:50.720]  I'll keep the bag for myself.
[25:50.720 --> 25:51.560]  Right.
[25:51.560 --> 25:55.160]  And shout out to not writing on the plastic.
[25:55.160 --> 25:56.560]  Like some of, you know, some of the things.
[25:56.560 --> 25:58.120]  That wears off, man.
[25:58.120 --> 25:58.960]  Yeah.
[25:58.960 --> 26:00.640]  You can't do that.
[26:00.640 --> 26:01.560]  Yeah.
[26:01.560 --> 26:02.760]  I do have some cool ones.
[26:02.760 --> 26:04.560]  I was telling you about previous to this,
[26:04.560 --> 26:06.800]  that I did get permission from the,
[26:07.760 --> 26:11.840]  the old school homie that gifted me some of these skunks
[26:11.840 --> 26:14.560]  from the nineties.
[26:14.560 --> 26:18.480]  One goes back to, I believe since 1982 on here.
[26:18.480 --> 26:20.280]  Oh, wow.
[26:21.160 --> 26:22.000]  All right.
[26:22.000 --> 26:25.280]  So let's just, let's just, let's go there for a second.
[26:25.280 --> 26:26.120]  Let's do it.
[26:26.120 --> 26:26.960]  Let's do it.
[26:26.960 --> 26:27.780]  Okay.
[26:27.780 --> 26:30.800]  So his name is dirty white boy, Rico,
[26:30.800 --> 26:32.400]  something with some numbers on it.
[26:32.400 --> 26:33.240]  Okay.
[26:33.240 --> 26:34.520]  He, he did give me permission.
[26:34.520 --> 26:38.440]  He told me not to mention his real name or, you know,
[26:38.440 --> 26:39.560]  where he resides at.
[26:39.560 --> 26:42.440]  So we'll just, we'll kind of leave it at that.
[26:42.440 --> 26:43.280]  A shout out.
[26:43.280 --> 26:45.120]  He's another guy I just met through some,
[26:45.120 --> 26:46.440]  some of the auctions.
[26:46.440 --> 26:48.720]  And then for some reason,
[26:48.720 --> 26:52.600]  he took a liking to me enough to give me some crazy ass
[26:52.600 --> 26:55.860]  seeds that I believe,
[26:56.800 --> 27:01.800]  I believe he knows a friend of the show, Duke Diamond,
[27:02.200 --> 27:05.240]  who I would consider a legend that I,
[27:05.240 --> 27:06.800]  everything I remember is great.
[27:06.800 --> 27:08.520]  So shout out to Duke,
[27:08.520 --> 27:13.320]  but this guy hooked me up with something called
[27:14.920 --> 27:16.640]  dad stuff.
[27:16.680 --> 27:18.200]  Dad stuff.
[27:18.200 --> 27:20.360]  1975 to 2000.
[27:20.360 --> 27:23.160]  So it's like an F 30.
[27:23.160 --> 27:27.000]  This guy was like, you know, it's look,
[27:27.000 --> 27:28.920]  this is fire dad stuff.
[27:30.200 --> 27:33.000]  Purple is just like, you know what I mean?
[27:33.000 --> 27:35.160]  Like, dude, like it looks like my son, bro.
[27:35.160 --> 27:36.000]  You know what I mean?
[27:36.000 --> 27:38.120]  Like you could have wrote a little neater,
[27:38.120 --> 27:40.640]  but shout out to Rico, dirty white boy.
[27:40.640 --> 27:43.440]  This one, maybe I shouldn't say, well, whatever he said,
[27:43.440 --> 27:44.280]  I could say it.
[27:44.440 --> 27:46.560]  This one is called Dave Watson skunk.
[27:47.560 --> 27:48.400]  Okay.
[27:48.400 --> 27:49.240]  It's crazy.
[27:49.240 --> 27:50.800]  So look, when I got these in my hands though,
[27:50.800 --> 27:54.280]  and I seen the years, this is 1982 to 1985.
[27:54.280 --> 27:55.120]  Dang.
[27:55.120 --> 27:57.640]  Like, dang, I'm like, I'm gonna get them going.
[27:57.640 --> 27:58.480]  And I actually do.
[27:58.480 --> 28:03.080]  So these packs are empty, but I did the
[28:04.200 --> 28:06.800]  hydrogen peroxide, like 10%, I believe,
[28:08.280 --> 28:10.720]  10% or 20% forget what it is.
[28:11.800 --> 28:13.540]  So to that water.
[28:15.240 --> 28:16.080]  I'm sorry.
[28:16.080 --> 28:17.000]  I heard some cats.
[28:17.000 --> 28:19.520]  Dave Watson is Sam, the skunk man.
[28:19.520 --> 28:20.340]  Oh, it is.
[28:20.340 --> 28:21.180]  Okay.
[28:21.180 --> 28:22.000]  So yeah.
[28:22.000 --> 28:22.840]  I don't know about the-
[28:22.840 --> 28:23.680]  I mean, same difference.
[28:23.680 --> 28:25.240]  No, well, I mean, same person,
[28:25.240 --> 28:28.400]  but some of the older people, you know,
[28:28.400 --> 28:29.880]  know him by Dave Watson.
[28:29.880 --> 28:31.480]  And then there's other people who know-
[28:31.480 --> 28:35.000]  1995 skunk BX4, it says.
[28:36.760 --> 28:39.000]  And then by the way, you're saying like the magic words.
[28:39.000 --> 28:40.960]  I almost feel like it should be Pee-wee's Playhouse
[28:40.960 --> 28:42.920]  where every time you say the word skunk,
[28:42.920 --> 28:44.720]  everybody in chat, we need to go, ah!
[28:47.560 --> 28:50.360]  Yeah, you can tell we're from the same club.
[28:50.360 --> 28:52.680]  We come from the same club, Pee-wee's Playhouse, baby.
[28:52.680 --> 28:53.520]  Shout out.
[28:54.880 --> 28:55.800]  Look at this.
[28:55.800 --> 28:59.320]  This one says, I don't know if you can read this.
[28:59.320 --> 29:04.320]  Look, this one says, this was from my dad's vault.
[29:05.040 --> 29:06.680]  Wine cellar.
[29:06.680 --> 29:07.720]  This is fire.
[29:07.720 --> 29:10.080]  It's just like scribble on your A plus plus.
[29:10.080 --> 29:13.480]  Straight from his safe spot wine cellar.
[29:13.480 --> 29:14.800]  Very old strain.
[29:18.000 --> 29:20.600]  I think that says unreleased BX6.
[29:22.720 --> 29:26.120]  These, see, I can barely even read it still,
[29:26.120 --> 29:28.440]  but that's how you know it's fucking good.
[29:28.440 --> 29:29.280]  No one has it.
[29:29.280 --> 29:30.120]  No one has it.
[29:30.120 --> 29:30.960]  I have it.
[29:30.960 --> 29:33.000]  Hey, hey, shout out.
[29:33.000 --> 29:34.520]  Dave, you ain't got these.
[29:34.520 --> 29:35.720]  Dave is not here.
[29:35.720 --> 29:37.200]  Dave is not here.
[29:37.200 --> 29:38.040]  Checkmate.
[29:39.040 --> 29:40.920]  But I have all those running right now,
[29:40.920 --> 29:42.400]  so everyone stay tuned.
[29:42.400 --> 29:46.680]  I mean, I got a pretty good germination rate.
[29:46.680 --> 29:47.920]  You know what I'm saying?
[29:49.480 --> 29:51.960]  I got them all to actually open up and crack,
[29:53.880 --> 29:57.280]  but after putting them in some soil,
[29:58.280 --> 30:01.080]  you know, probably like 70% of them popped up.
[30:01.080 --> 30:01.920]  You know what I mean?
[30:01.920 --> 30:03.840]  The rest of them just took it out.
[30:03.840 --> 30:06.920]  And I'll try forever to see if it's gonna come up.
[30:06.960 --> 30:10.800]  And then eventually I'll do like an archeologist.
[30:10.800 --> 30:13.280]  Yes, you like do stuff.
[30:13.280 --> 30:14.840]  There's a deaded out little thing.
[30:14.840 --> 30:16.520]  Like, oh, at least, yeah,
[30:16.520 --> 30:17.360]  cause like what happened?
[30:17.360 --> 30:19.160]  Cause sometimes, you know, if you like,
[30:20.160 --> 30:22.800]  you know, make the hole too deep and it like falls down,
[30:22.800 --> 30:24.680]  there's all that kinds of stuff.
[30:24.680 --> 30:27.480]  So that's why I like to do the paper towel method
[30:27.480 --> 30:28.320]  on most stuff.
[30:28.320 --> 30:30.400]  But these ones I just did in a little glass
[30:30.400 --> 30:34.640]  with like I said, the hydrogen peroxide and water mix.
[30:34.640 --> 30:38.400]  And I believe I heard that from a Moscow,
[30:38.400 --> 30:40.240]  Moscow, yeah, not Moscow.
[30:40.240 --> 30:41.080]  Moscow.
[30:41.080 --> 30:43.320]  Yeah, Moscow seeds.
[30:43.320 --> 30:44.160]  And that's, you know,
[30:44.160 --> 30:45.840]  that's a really good germination rate.
[30:45.840 --> 30:47.880]  I mean, especially for things that are that old
[30:47.880 --> 30:49.480]  and you know, they're not in like,
[30:49.480 --> 30:52.760]  you know, your hermetically sealed wraps environment,
[30:52.760 --> 30:55.160]  you know, construction paper taped over like.
[30:55.160 --> 30:56.000]  Well, yeah.
[30:56.000 --> 30:56.840]  That's good stuff, man.
[30:56.840 --> 30:57.680]  They just store them.
[30:57.680 --> 30:58.520]  So he did tell me that, I mean,
[30:58.520 --> 31:00.360]  he sent them to me in these little packages,
[31:00.360 --> 31:01.200]  you know what I mean?
[31:01.200 --> 31:02.920]  They didn't just come.
[31:02.920 --> 31:06.060]  And he did say that his dad was like a very organized,
[31:07.240 --> 31:09.560]  like ex military guy that was storing all these.
[31:09.560 --> 31:10.760]  Precision then.
[31:10.760 --> 31:11.600]  Right.
[31:11.600 --> 31:14.000]  Precision is in their vocabulary.
[31:14.000 --> 31:14.840]  Yes.
[31:14.840 --> 31:16.040]  So they did come,
[31:16.040 --> 31:17.800]  I think they did come out of a good place.
[31:17.800 --> 31:20.960]  So now that we got that out and he's actually,
[31:20.960 --> 31:22.920]  he's actually getting ready to release some seeds.
[31:22.920 --> 31:27.920]  Like I said, he does have some connection at Duke Diamond.
[31:28.920 --> 31:30.520]  Other than that, you know,
[31:30.520 --> 31:31.360]  go check them out,
[31:31.360 --> 31:33.640]  go see something or other dirty white boy.
[31:33.640 --> 31:35.520]  If you really want to,
[31:35.520 --> 31:37.240]  but he did, I was,
[31:37.240 --> 31:38.880]  I was talking with him on Halloween.
[31:38.880 --> 31:40.120]  I told him I'm gonna come on here.
[31:40.120 --> 31:40.960]  And I'm like, you know,
[31:40.960 --> 31:42.160]  if you don't want me to mention you,
[31:42.160 --> 31:45.280]  cause he's not, you know what I mean?
[31:45.280 --> 31:48.280]  He doesn't have like a presence on Instagram where he's like,
[31:48.280 --> 31:50.520]  oh, a bunch of dope and all this shit.
[31:50.520 --> 31:51.720]  So it's like,
[31:51.720 --> 31:52.560]  Yeah.
[31:52.560 --> 31:53.400]  Yeah.
[31:53.400 --> 31:54.440]  I wanted to, I wanted to make sure,
[31:54.440 --> 31:55.740]  cause I was like, I just won't mention you,
[31:55.740 --> 31:58.280]  but I'm going to mention the CGA because they're,
[31:58.280 --> 32:00.080]  you know, they're cool as hell.
[32:00.080 --> 32:01.320]  Well, that's, I mean, that's good.
[32:02.160 --> 32:04.760]  That's very respectful and it's important.
[32:04.760 --> 32:07.040]  It's almost like, you know,
[32:07.040 --> 32:08.880]  getting a secret in life.
[32:08.880 --> 32:09.880]  It's like, okay,
[32:09.880 --> 32:11.640]  if you get that secret and you hold it,
[32:11.640 --> 32:13.440]  you're going to get more secrets.
[32:13.440 --> 32:16.840]  But if you let that secret go,
[32:16.840 --> 32:18.760]  you might not get so many secrets later.
[32:18.760 --> 32:19.680]  So yeah.
[32:19.680 --> 32:20.820]  And seeds are kind of like that.
[32:20.820 --> 32:21.960]  It's just a, like you said,
[32:21.960 --> 32:22.880]  it's a respect thing.
[32:22.880 --> 32:24.880]  There are people where, you know,
[32:24.880 --> 32:28.080]  either they're not in a legal state
[32:28.080 --> 32:30.120]  or they just aren't in a position
[32:30.120 --> 32:31.440]  of where they want to be known.
[32:31.440 --> 32:32.360]  A lot of growers,
[32:32.360 --> 32:35.560]  like a lot of the really good growers and breeders,
[32:35.560 --> 32:37.560]  you're not going to see on YouTube.
[32:37.560 --> 32:39.120]  I'm just putting it like that.
[32:39.120 --> 32:40.560]  You're not going to see them here.
[32:40.560 --> 32:41.600]  They don't have Instagram.
[32:41.600 --> 32:43.440]  They can barely do Gmail.
[32:43.440 --> 32:44.760]  Is that different than email?
[32:44.760 --> 32:45.600]  Like, you know?
[32:45.600 --> 32:46.440]  Right, right.
[32:46.440 --> 32:47.880]  No, I mean, I came from,
[32:47.880 --> 32:49.800]  I came from that whole,
[32:49.800 --> 32:50.720]  that whole world.
[32:50.720 --> 32:53.160]  And even, even when I was, you know,
[32:53.160 --> 32:55.400]  growing weed on the legal,
[32:55.400 --> 32:57.680]  legal scene and putting my stuff in stores,
[32:57.680 --> 32:58.520]  you know,
[32:59.360 --> 33:00.560]  when, you know,
[33:00.560 --> 33:01.400]  whatever you want to call it,
[33:01.400 --> 33:04.000]  the backpack days in California.
[33:04.000 --> 33:06.320]  And here in Michigan,
[33:06.320 --> 33:07.480]  where you could still,
[33:09.480 --> 33:10.960]  the store make, you know,
[33:10.960 --> 33:12.600]  show them the product, make a deal,
[33:12.600 --> 33:13.440]  walk, you know,
[33:13.440 --> 33:16.040]  walk out with a fistful of cash or whatever.
[33:16.040 --> 33:18.320]  So I do understand that.
[33:18.320 --> 33:20.880]  I mean, the only reason I ever really got on Instagram
[33:20.880 --> 33:22.600]  or tried to,
[33:22.600 --> 33:23.960]  I didn't call it like build a brand,
[33:23.960 --> 33:26.920]  but just put myself out there a little more
[33:26.960 --> 33:28.400]  is because,
[33:30.200 --> 33:31.200]  like I said, I was,
[33:31.200 --> 33:33.280]  I was trying to get,
[33:33.280 --> 33:34.400]  you know, a license.
[33:34.400 --> 33:35.240]  I was like,
[33:35.240 --> 33:37.440]  I must have been running for it all fizzled out.
[33:37.440 --> 33:38.280]  But,
[33:39.480 --> 33:40.520]  so yeah, I was like,
[33:40.520 --> 33:41.360]  oh, you know,
[33:41.360 --> 33:42.800]  this, this is part of,
[33:42.800 --> 33:44.080]  part of the game and stuff.
[33:44.080 --> 33:44.960]  But, you know,
[33:44.960 --> 33:45.920]  and I, and I've had,
[33:45.920 --> 33:47.280]  oh, I've had old school homies.
[33:47.280 --> 33:49.280]  I mean, I'm originally from Ohio where it's,
[33:49.280 --> 33:50.120]  you know,
[33:50.120 --> 33:51.600]  it's still illegal to home grow.
[33:52.840 --> 33:53.680]  You know what I mean?
[33:53.680 --> 33:54.920]  No one,
[33:54.920 --> 33:56.560]  I mean, they have stores now and stuff,
[33:57.200 --> 33:59.960]  but all the weed,
[33:59.960 --> 34:01.440]  all the good weed there is from,
[34:01.440 --> 34:03.200]  you know, from Michigan.
[34:04.840 --> 34:05.680]  Exactly.
[34:05.680 --> 34:08.440]  I heard somebody else was saying that actually,
[34:08.440 --> 34:10.520]  I think I'm not going to say their name was,
[34:10.520 --> 34:11.480]  but they were talking about,
[34:11.480 --> 34:14.320]  I think it was Wisconsin or something like right next door
[34:14.320 --> 34:15.920]  going legal.
[34:15.920 --> 34:16.760]  And he's like,
[34:16.760 --> 34:18.720]  I really hope they don't because
[34:18.720 --> 34:21.760]  they're getting all this good Michigan shit.
[34:23.760 --> 34:24.600]  But yeah,
[34:24.600 --> 34:25.560]  Chicago too.
[34:26.560 --> 34:27.400]  I'm close.
[34:27.400 --> 34:30.040]  I'm closer to Chicago than I am to Detroit.
[34:30.040 --> 34:30.880]  You know what I mean?
[34:30.880 --> 34:35.200]  I'm only like an hour and a half from downtown Chicago,
[34:35.200 --> 34:36.680]  maybe hour 45.
[34:37.600 --> 34:39.120]  That's,
[34:39.120 --> 34:41.720]  that's without hitting all this traffic and shit.
[34:41.720 --> 34:42.920]  Yeah, fuck traffic.
[34:42.920 --> 34:43.800]  And that's-
[34:43.800 --> 34:44.960]  I'm like four hours from,
[34:44.960 --> 34:46.640]  or three and a half hours to Detroit,
[34:46.640 --> 34:47.960]  you know, so.
[34:47.960 --> 34:48.800]  Yeah.
[34:48.800 --> 34:49.640]  Just to give you a reference,
[34:49.640 --> 34:50.840]  I'm in the very,
[34:50.840 --> 34:51.680]  how do they do it?
[34:51.680 --> 34:52.560]  They show a mitten.
[34:53.560 --> 34:55.160]  I don't know, Mike.
[34:55.160 --> 34:58.200]  I was right here, Holland.
[34:58.200 --> 34:59.480]  So Holland is like,
[34:59.480 --> 35:00.320]  Holland was like right there.
[35:00.320 --> 35:03.280]  Well no, the farm is on the other side, isn't it?
[35:03.280 --> 35:04.120]  Yeah.
[35:04.120 --> 35:05.200]  Oh shit, Lake Erie.
[35:05.200 --> 35:06.680]  See, I still remember from school,
[35:06.680 --> 35:07.800]  the Holmes Academy.
[35:07.800 --> 35:08.640]  You got here.
[35:08.640 --> 35:09.480]  You know what I'm here.
[35:09.480 --> 35:10.320]  Or here.
[35:10.320 --> 35:12.280]  You're like right here.
[35:12.280 --> 35:14.560]  I'm like, I'm like underneath my sleeve.
[35:14.560 --> 35:15.760]  This is Indiana.
[35:15.760 --> 35:16.600]  You're deep.
[35:16.600 --> 35:17.800]  I'm in there.
[35:17.800 --> 35:19.440]  I go grocery shopping in Indiana.
[35:19.440 --> 35:20.280]  That's how close, you know,
[35:20.280 --> 35:21.880]  I'm like five miles from there.
[35:22.640 --> 35:24.760]  So I'm right near South Bend, Indiana.
[35:28.040 --> 35:29.480]  We used to go back and forth too.
[35:29.480 --> 35:30.320]  Yeah.
[35:30.320 --> 35:31.240]  The Chicago and Detroit,
[35:31.240 --> 35:32.080]  I was a Coast fan.
[35:32.080 --> 35:33.200]  My dad was a Tigers fan.
[35:33.200 --> 35:34.720]  We were pretty much in the middle of both.
[35:34.720 --> 35:37.520]  So, or I think it was like three hours either way.
[35:37.520 --> 35:39.400]  I'm big on sports and I'm big on going,
[35:39.400 --> 35:41.520]  I'm big on being that, that guy.
[35:41.520 --> 35:42.360]  You know what I mean?
[35:42.360 --> 35:43.680]  The out of town, you know,
[35:43.680 --> 35:44.760]  the other team.
[35:44.760 --> 35:46.840]  You want to hear the worst part?
[35:46.840 --> 35:48.520]  So I told you I was a Coast fan, right?
[35:48.520 --> 35:50.360]  And I literally waited my entire life
[35:50.360 --> 35:51.840]  to see a World Series.
[35:52.680 --> 35:54.960]  My first football game was the fucking Lions.
[35:56.720 --> 35:59.680]  Dude, they've never won a Superbowl in my life.
[36:00.720 --> 36:02.520]  Come on, man.
[36:02.520 --> 36:03.360]  Yeah.
[36:03.360 --> 36:05.760]  Well, I'm a Browns fan, so.
[36:07.760 --> 36:08.920]  The Browns were the champions
[36:08.920 --> 36:10.560]  before the Superbowl was a thing.
[36:12.840 --> 36:13.880]  All right, what are we going to do?
[36:13.880 --> 36:16.120]  Let's do some seed offs here.
[36:16.120 --> 36:18.720]  Let's, let's do a seed collector show.
[36:18.720 --> 36:20.680]  People don't want to hear about me talking about.
[36:21.640 --> 36:24.920]  Now we had a comment from Bud and Lather actually.
[36:24.920 --> 36:25.960]  I am wearing a shirt.
[36:25.960 --> 36:27.800]  You should check out the beginning of the show
[36:27.800 --> 36:31.240]  because I always like to do, you know,
[36:31.240 --> 36:32.840]  a new shirt from a different person,
[36:32.840 --> 36:34.040]  different company each time.
[36:34.040 --> 36:37.200]  Okay, but Bud and Lather had a comment for us here.
[36:37.200 --> 36:39.720]  It says, do you have the pie, the pot?
[36:39.720 --> 36:42.560]  Oh, I fucking, I'm butchering that.
[36:43.480 --> 36:47.560]  That collaboration we did with the Duckfoot
[36:47.600 --> 36:52.240]  and I'm going to say, yes, I do.
[36:52.240 --> 36:53.080]  Kaboom.
[36:53.080 --> 36:55.680]  Ooh, man, you are coming with the Heedres.
[36:55.680 --> 36:58.640]  So Hawaiian Duckfoot IBL.
[36:58.640 --> 37:02.320]  So that means it's in, it's locked in those traits.
[37:02.320 --> 37:03.800]  Time to space cheese.
[37:03.800 --> 37:06.160]  So this was a collab they did.
[37:06.160 --> 37:09.120]  The space cheese was coming from Mr. Toad.
[37:09.120 --> 37:11.400]  Oh, I just ran over a pack with my chair.
[37:13.280 --> 37:14.800]  I got so many seeds.
[37:14.920 --> 37:15.760]  Oh, no.
[37:18.760 --> 37:20.200]  You hear this people?
[37:20.200 --> 37:21.440]  That's a seed cracker.
[37:22.760 --> 37:24.280]  And shout out to Tony on that too.
[37:24.280 --> 37:26.080]  I do have one of those.
[37:26.080 --> 37:28.560]  He made some seed crackers on his 3D printer.
[37:28.560 --> 37:29.880]  I have one of those.
[37:29.880 --> 37:32.200]  I have one of the clone shippers he has
[37:32.200 --> 37:36.360]  with the, you know, totally bone or whatever.
[37:36.360 --> 37:38.160]  And it's got the little knife in there.
[37:38.160 --> 37:39.000]  Sick.
[37:39.000 --> 37:41.120]  I would hate to send it away.
[37:41.120 --> 37:44.160]  I'd be like, dude, here's a return postage.
[37:44.280 --> 37:46.440]  I put mine in a Pringles can or some shit.
[37:48.000 --> 37:48.960]  Pringles cans work good.
[37:48.960 --> 37:50.120]  You know what else works really good?
[37:50.120 --> 37:53.240]  If you're sending clones and I don't recommend doing this
[37:53.240 --> 37:54.480]  cause you know what I mean?
[37:54.480 --> 37:55.320]  You know, whatever.
[37:55.320 --> 37:59.480]  But if you get the plastic, like if you get the good eggs,
[37:59.480 --> 38:01.200]  you know, like the cage free eggs.
[38:01.200 --> 38:02.360]  Yeah.
[38:02.360 --> 38:03.640]  You know how they come in plastic,
[38:03.640 --> 38:06.800]  which is kind of like ironic with their, you know,
[38:06.800 --> 38:07.960]  whatever and the place.
[38:09.960 --> 38:13.320]  If you have it in a rapid router, right?
[38:13.320 --> 38:18.320]  Boom, that fits in one thing.
[38:18.440 --> 38:20.680]  So it's like, boom, you can put that.
[38:20.680 --> 38:24.400]  But honestly, if you are into shipping genetics and stuff,
[38:24.400 --> 38:28.240]  I recommend just taking snips, getting multiple snips,
[38:28.240 --> 38:30.520]  wrap them in a little paper towel,
[38:30.520 --> 38:32.600]  put those in a, you know, Ziploc bag
[38:32.600 --> 38:36.080]  and then vacuum seal that and stick that in a box.
[38:36.080 --> 38:40.920]  And another tip I will say on that is do not dip your cuts.
[38:40.920 --> 38:41.760]  Try and, you know what I mean?
[38:41.760 --> 38:43.480]  Don't do like a sulfur dip.
[38:43.480 --> 38:44.320]  Right.
[38:44.320 --> 38:46.160]  Try to be responsible before you send them
[38:46.160 --> 38:48.840]  because what happens is if they're all wet,
[38:48.840 --> 38:52.360]  they will just die off like in the packaging.
[38:52.360 --> 38:56.000]  So that's just a little tip I learned recently.
[38:56.000 --> 38:58.400]  I just try to be too courteous and said,
[38:58.400 --> 39:01.320]  oh, I'll give him a nice clean dip and yada, yada, yada.
[39:01.320 --> 39:02.320]  Well, thank you.
[39:02.320 --> 39:03.720]  Yeah, right.
[39:03.720 --> 39:05.320]  Cause I mean, that's the number one thing
[39:05.320 --> 39:07.760]  that you got to be concerned about with clones.
[39:07.760 --> 39:11.840]  Like I've taken one clone in over 10 years
[39:12.920 --> 39:15.240]  and it was from an archive in Portland.
[39:15.240 --> 39:16.080]  It was Purple Punch.
[39:16.080 --> 39:16.960]  It was my wife's favorite.
[39:16.960 --> 39:17.800]  It was the honeymoon.
[39:17.800 --> 39:18.640]  We saw it.
[39:18.640 --> 39:20.480]  I'm like, all right, I'll take a clone in.
[39:20.480 --> 39:21.760]  But isolate them guys.
[39:21.760 --> 39:25.120]  If you ever get clones, you know,
[39:25.120 --> 39:27.760]  do the dunk like Tommy was saying, but also isolate them.
[39:27.760 --> 39:29.520]  Keep them away from your main thing.
[39:29.520 --> 39:31.840]  I usually, you know, would recommend people
[39:31.840 --> 39:34.720]  also change the soil out when you transplant too.
[39:34.720 --> 39:37.120]  Cause eggs, a lot of those things,
[39:37.520 --> 39:39.800]  a lot of problems that can come, come in the soil.
[39:39.800 --> 39:42.160]  You don't always see it when you get them.
[39:42.160 --> 39:44.720]  If it's coming with soil, that's usually picked up
[39:44.720 --> 39:46.240]  at like a farmer's market and stuff.
[39:46.240 --> 39:48.720]  But the shipping, yes.
[39:48.720 --> 39:53.720]  I also have found shipping cigar boxes.
[39:55.280 --> 39:58.080]  I've had a bunch of those sitting out
[39:59.200 --> 40:00.080]  because you can usually,
[40:00.080 --> 40:03.600]  or I would just go to the like smoke shop
[40:03.600 --> 40:06.080]  and be like, hey, got any empty boxes?
[40:06.080 --> 40:08.240]  I mean, they're long, they're flat,
[40:08.240 --> 40:09.920]  they're solid, they're light.
[40:09.920 --> 40:10.760]  So.
[40:10.760 --> 40:11.600]  Oh yeah.
[40:11.600 --> 40:12.440]  Even just the box.
[40:12.440 --> 40:13.280]  That's usually, yeah.
[40:13.280 --> 40:14.120]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[40:14.120 --> 40:14.960]  Yeah.
[40:14.960 --> 40:17.280]  Put them in the actual tubes, you know, cigar tubes.
[40:19.000 --> 40:20.240]  But yeah, like if you're good,
[40:20.240 --> 40:22.800]  if you're doing the rapid router style or a rock wall block,
[40:22.800 --> 40:25.080]  I mean, those, those egg cartons do work pretty,
[40:25.080 --> 40:26.960]  pretty well for that.
[40:26.960 --> 40:27.800]  Yeah.
[40:27.800 --> 40:28.640]  Let's see.
[40:28.640 --> 40:29.600]  We had, we had another one for purple thumb.
[40:29.600 --> 40:31.640]  He's like Bob's cheddar, Bob's cheddar.
[40:31.640 --> 40:33.240]  I do have Bob's cheddar.
[40:33.320 --> 40:36.160]  That was, that one's after a cheddar.
[40:36.160 --> 40:37.480]  Yeah, I have Bob's cheddar in the plant.
[40:37.480 --> 40:39.080]  I already ran my Bob's cheddar.
[40:40.000 --> 40:40.840]  Wash is good.
[40:40.840 --> 40:42.680]  I just got the report back from Terp Wizard.
[40:42.680 --> 40:43.920]  Shout out to Terp Wizard.
[40:45.560 --> 40:49.120]  I can't wait to get the rosin, but yeah,
[40:49.120 --> 40:51.520]  the numbers came back pretty, pretty good.
[40:51.520 --> 40:55.640]  I think it's a little over three or right around 3%
[40:55.640 --> 40:57.280]  on the Bob's cheddar.
[40:57.280 --> 40:59.480]  Also the Ganjoji.
[40:59.480 --> 41:02.120]  So I just ran those two from Toad.
[41:02.120 --> 41:05.080]  And I've also ran that one hitter quitter.
[41:05.080 --> 41:05.920]  Okay.
[41:05.920 --> 41:09.000]  Now what can you tell me maybe about growing that one?
[41:09.000 --> 41:11.480]  Cause I, you know, I've not planted it yet.
[41:11.480 --> 41:12.320]  Yep.
[41:12.320 --> 41:16.240]  It's a short, it's like a shorter kind of structure.
[41:17.680 --> 41:19.800]  Very, very potent.
[41:20.680 --> 41:25.680]  And it's, it has like a crazy kind of like chemical,
[41:28.760 --> 41:31.200]  like not, I wouldn't say chem dog,
[41:31.240 --> 41:34.320]  but like a chemical kind of like plasticky,
[41:34.320 --> 41:37.920]  like this kind of plastic funk.
[41:37.920 --> 41:39.040]  Right.
[41:39.040 --> 41:42.720]  And I look, so what I do is I'll pass out a bunch of cuts,
[41:42.720 --> 41:46.120]  right in springtime to people that I know
[41:46.120 --> 41:48.840]  that want to do outdoor gardens, this and that.
[41:48.840 --> 41:50.920]  So it's like, I can keep my plant count
[41:50.920 --> 41:51.840]  where it needs to be.
[41:51.840 --> 41:55.320]  And then I can, oh, here's some free clump.
[41:55.320 --> 41:59.000]  And then, you know, I write down so-and-so's got these four
[41:59.000 --> 42:00.280]  and so-and-so's got these.
[42:01.280 --> 42:05.360]  I'll go back and it always doesn't work out, obviously.
[42:05.360 --> 42:09.280]  I did pass out the one hitter quitter to a friend.
[42:09.280 --> 42:10.960]  And then it's like, I got over there.
[42:10.960 --> 42:14.480]  He's like, well, some of them didn't do so good.
[42:14.480 --> 42:16.840]  I said, all right, you know, I'm not gonna.
[42:16.840 --> 42:17.800]  It happens.
[42:17.800 --> 42:18.640]  Yeah.
[42:18.640 --> 42:20.640]  I mean, I knew who I was giving it to.
[42:20.640 --> 42:24.000]  It's not like I was giving it to, you know,
[42:24.000 --> 42:26.080]  somebody like, oh, you got to, you know,
[42:26.080 --> 42:27.400]  you cut this back.
[42:27.400 --> 42:28.240]  Yeah.
[42:30.800 --> 42:31.640]  Yeah.
[42:33.560 --> 42:37.040]  So you mentioned too that you were growing out, you know,
[42:37.040 --> 42:40.640]  some of those skunks, some of those skunks right now.
[42:42.000 --> 42:44.480]  What is the morphology like?
[42:44.480 --> 42:46.120]  Are they, you know, kind of, or well,
[42:46.120 --> 42:49.080]  I guess maybe how old are they and do they,
[42:49.080 --> 42:53.680]  are they tall, short, tight internodes, big leaves?
[42:53.680 --> 42:56.960]  Like, or is there a variety?
[42:56.960 --> 42:57.800]  Yeah.
[42:57.800 --> 43:00.080]  I mean, it's really hard to say at this point.
[43:00.880 --> 43:05.880]  I just took the top, you know, the top Mary's stem clone.
[43:06.040 --> 43:07.840]  So I have a clone of each of, you know,
[43:07.840 --> 43:12.840]  each of those going, but one I didn't show was the,
[43:12.880 --> 43:15.880]  I believe it was the 91 skunk.
[43:15.880 --> 43:17.840]  And that was, I mean, you know,
[43:17.840 --> 43:21.520]  when we're talking in one gallon pots are only, you know,
[43:21.520 --> 43:23.080]  less than a foot tall.
[43:23.080 --> 43:23.920]  Yeah.
[43:25.280 --> 43:28.280]  God, like this one smells ridiculous, you know, already.
[43:28.280 --> 43:31.760]  So like, and I mean, like I said,
[43:31.760 --> 43:35.520]  it's really hard to tell right now because I got them up
[43:35.520 --> 43:39.400]  about eight to 10 inches tall and took a cut off the top.
[43:39.400 --> 43:40.240]  Yeah.
[43:40.240 --> 43:41.080]  Okay.
[43:41.080 --> 43:43.120]  You get to see that, you know, when you take,
[43:43.120 --> 43:44.760]  when you do that, it just, you know,
[43:44.760 --> 43:47.960]  you basically leave like a little, a little stub with,
[43:48.920 --> 43:50.920]  you know, just a couple leaves,
[43:50.920 --> 43:53.280]  but then they, and then they blow right up.
[43:53.280 --> 43:57.040]  And then how I do it is I'll take those and I leave,
[43:57.040 --> 43:58.880]  just leave them in a one gallon pot.
[43:58.880 --> 44:00.920]  I pack them all just in one tent.
[44:00.920 --> 44:01.960]  You know what I mean?
[44:02.920 --> 44:06.880]  However many under one light and you know what I mean?
[44:06.880 --> 44:10.560]  That way I'm just kind of getting a general idea.
[44:10.560 --> 44:11.480]  We'll say, you know what I mean?
[44:11.480 --> 44:12.320]  Fishing around.
[44:13.360 --> 44:16.000]  Another thing I do is I, when I pop other people's seeds,
[44:16.000 --> 44:19.160]  I always pop, so I'll pop like whatever.
[44:19.160 --> 44:22.560]  So some smiley seeds, I've got some of these old seeds.
[44:22.560 --> 44:25.000]  I always put some stuff that I made, right?
[44:25.000 --> 44:26.440]  So that they're all, you know,
[44:26.440 --> 44:27.280]  everything's getting the same.
[44:27.280 --> 44:30.600]  And then I always compare, you know,
[44:30.600 --> 44:33.120]  I consider myself just like a pollen chucker,
[44:33.120 --> 44:36.080]  you know, a hobbyist breeder.
[44:36.080 --> 44:38.880]  I'm getting ready to put my hat in the ring for,
[44:39.800 --> 44:41.560]  you know, for packaging up some seeds.
[44:41.560 --> 44:42.400]  But-
[44:42.400 --> 44:43.240]  You've been working on it.
[44:43.240 --> 44:45.240]  So that's the most important thing.
[44:45.240 --> 44:49.520]  That's one more step further than many people.
[44:49.520 --> 44:50.360]  Right, right.
[44:50.360 --> 44:51.200]  Yeah.
[44:51.200 --> 44:53.640]  And I, like I said, it does take forever, you know?
[44:53.640 --> 44:56.720]  So I do understand where people are like, oh, you know.
[44:56.720 --> 45:01.720]  So like, yeah, I'm running some stuff that I've made.
[45:01.760 --> 45:02.600]  Yeah, like, I mean-
[45:02.600 --> 45:04.520]  Give it to them, give it to friends.
[45:04.520 --> 45:09.000]  Proper, like proper breeding is almost dead in the sense
[45:09.000 --> 45:11.840]  that it takes you a couple of years to really do it.
[45:11.840 --> 45:14.520]  And the market these days
[45:14.520 --> 45:16.920]  doesn't have a two-year attention span.
[45:16.920 --> 45:17.760]  So-
[45:17.760 --> 45:20.200]  Oh yeah, I mean, there's no way to predict that.
[45:20.200 --> 45:22.680]  Even trying to, even trying to just grow flower,
[45:23.920 --> 45:26.200]  for we'll say the market, you know what I mean?
[45:26.200 --> 45:29.280]  It's like, oh, you know, oh, you know, everyone likes,
[45:29.280 --> 45:30.960]  you know, what do they say, Gorilla Glue?
[45:30.960 --> 45:34.040]  Oh, and then by the time, you know, three months later
[45:34.040 --> 45:35.040]  when the crop's done, it's like,
[45:35.040 --> 45:37.280]  oh, they're even more Gorilla Glue, dude.
[45:37.280 --> 45:38.560]  Like, all right, like.
[45:39.720 --> 45:43.080]  So I guess the blue dream, we're in the blue dream now.
[45:43.080 --> 45:45.480]  But, you know, it's one of those things though.
[45:45.480 --> 45:49.600]  So you're starting with a good base material.
[45:49.600 --> 45:52.520]  You have good knowledge of the, you know,
[45:52.560 --> 45:55.160]  the numerous varieties that you've grown.
[45:55.160 --> 45:58.360]  So whether it's popular now or not,
[45:58.360 --> 46:01.680]  whatever you come with is gonna be solid.
[46:01.680 --> 46:04.240]  And, you know, sometimes things are ahead of its time.
[46:04.240 --> 46:07.880]  So, you know, if something is solid though,
[46:07.880 --> 46:09.400]  it's gonna last through time.
[46:09.400 --> 46:11.600]  That's the big difference, I think.
[46:11.600 --> 46:14.320]  Especially with, you know, some of these cultivars
[46:14.320 --> 46:16.200]  that we see, you know, like White Widow.
[46:16.200 --> 46:17.320]  How old is White Widow?
[46:17.320 --> 46:18.360]  Still popular.
[46:18.360 --> 46:20.280]  I'd love to smoke some today.
[46:20.280 --> 46:21.120]  Why?
[46:21.120 --> 46:23.560]  Because it's a solid worked line.
[46:23.560 --> 46:28.560]  So yeah, hats off to you for working, doing what you do.
[46:28.680 --> 46:29.600]  I remember in high school, man,
[46:29.600 --> 46:30.760]  you'd get some White Widow.
[46:30.760 --> 46:32.880]  Ooh, you were the man, you were the man.
[46:32.880 --> 46:34.160]  What did you do to get there?
[46:34.160 --> 46:35.000]  Don't worry about it.
[46:35.000 --> 46:36.320]  It's over.
[46:36.320 --> 46:37.480]  I can't tell you.
[46:37.480 --> 46:39.040]  I might have to kill you.
[46:39.040 --> 46:40.640]  Yeah, dude, blown away.
[46:40.640 --> 46:44.080]  That, yeah, AK-47 and like Northern Lights,
[46:44.080 --> 46:45.840]  Alaskan Thunderfuck were the ones.
[46:45.840 --> 46:48.080]  And I think it was because they were in rap songs
[46:48.080 --> 46:50.080]  because nothing really had a name
[46:50.080 --> 46:53.040]  until like Cypress Hill came around in my area.
[46:53.040 --> 46:55.280]  And then it was those, it was, you know, it was one of those.
[46:55.280 --> 46:58.120]  But then, yeah, but then White Widow, man,
[46:58.120 --> 46:59.440]  you started, I started seeing that,
[46:59.440 --> 47:01.920]  like reading that in High Times Magazine.
[47:01.920 --> 47:03.400]  And that was picking up things.
[47:03.400 --> 47:05.840]  And then this new, it's like, it was like a sativa,
[47:05.840 --> 47:08.320]  which a lot of the stuff in the Pacific Northwest
[47:08.320 --> 47:12.080]  was more, I guess, indica leaning as far as like the effects,
[47:12.080 --> 47:13.720]  you know, sub-categorizing,
[47:13.720 --> 47:15.780]  nobody gets your panties in a twist.
[47:16.780 --> 47:19.780]  The blueberry, there was a blueberry
[47:19.780 --> 47:21.980]  that my dad used to grow when I was in high school.
[47:21.980 --> 47:24.860]  And it was fucking ridiculous.
[47:24.860 --> 47:27.580]  It wasn't like the normal kind of blueberry.
[47:27.580 --> 47:30.900]  This shit was like, I don't even know how to explain it.
[47:30.900 --> 47:32.300]  I know I was younger, you know what I mean?
[47:32.300 --> 47:34.900]  And I haven't seen it for a while, but it was like, man,
[47:34.900 --> 47:36.980]  like I still know, you know, it was,
[47:36.980 --> 47:39.780]  it was one of those strange ones, a huge hewler.
[47:39.780 --> 47:40.620]  Okay.
[47:40.620 --> 47:43.860]  Like little buds, but the most flavorful fucking weed,
[47:43.980 --> 47:46.940]  you know, my dad used to just do like, you know,
[47:46.940 --> 47:50.220]  he was like a outdoor, do guerrilla girls
[47:50.220 --> 47:51.820]  and stuff like that, so.
[47:51.820 --> 47:52.980]  That's cool.
[47:52.980 --> 47:56.260]  I see a comment here, Raymond Knight,
[47:56.260 --> 47:57.740]  he says, I've got an old black widow
[47:57.740 --> 48:00.460]  that I won't ever let go unless I lose it,
[48:00.460 --> 48:01.300]  which is awesome.
[48:01.300 --> 48:03.700]  Black widow, so black widow and white widow
[48:03.700 --> 48:05.540]  are essentially the same things.
[48:05.540 --> 48:08.660]  I forget exactly who it was.
[48:08.660 --> 48:11.540]  Chat, you probably know, and I know I've said it before,
[48:11.540 --> 48:14.860]  but I think it was maybe Shanti Baba or I could be wrong,
[48:14.860 --> 48:19.820]  but anyways, the white widow went to a different
[48:19.820 --> 48:22.220]  like commercial house in Amsterdam.
[48:22.220 --> 48:23.340]  I don't know if this was our job,
[48:23.340 --> 48:24.740]  I'm butchering the story now.
[48:24.740 --> 48:26.700]  So I'm just gonna stop there and say,
[48:26.700 --> 48:29.500]  black widow, white widow, same thing,
[48:29.500 --> 48:34.420]  just a different, a difference in business strategies.
[48:34.420 --> 48:35.700]  Shanti Baba, Raymond Knight.
[48:35.700 --> 48:40.020]  So, okay, so yeah, Shanti Baba, he had the black widow
[48:40.020 --> 48:43.820]  and then I forget which big seed company took it
[48:43.820 --> 48:45.260]  and then called it white widow
[48:45.260 --> 48:47.500]  and he's like, it's black widow.
[48:47.500 --> 48:48.340]  So that's-
[48:48.340 --> 48:50.980]  Yeah, so I was in Amsterdam culture too, man.
[48:50.980 --> 48:54.300]  I went there in 2003, I think it was.
[48:54.300 --> 48:58.420]  And it was just like, it blew my mind.
[48:58.420 --> 49:02.300]  I mean, I was like, man, I wanna live here and do this.
[49:02.300 --> 49:03.140]  You know what I'm saying?
[49:03.140 --> 49:05.300]  We did the same thing like 20 years later.
[49:05.300 --> 49:06.540]  I remember the time I was dealing with these hash guys,
[49:06.540 --> 49:09.020]  like, oh, look at the hash.
[49:11.020 --> 49:13.420]  Motherfuckers like, oh shit.
[49:13.420 --> 49:15.500]  Like I fucking, I remember I gave some dudes
[49:15.500 --> 49:18.100]  some hip hop CDs that they didn't have over there
[49:18.100 --> 49:20.340]  and they fucking like blessed me with some hash,
[49:20.340 --> 49:21.540]  like, oh shit.
[49:21.540 --> 49:25.020]  Like, it was crazy as hell just like seeing all that,
[49:25.020 --> 49:28.940]  like, you know, right out of high school, like, man.
[49:30.380 --> 49:32.220]  I don't even think I was 21 when I went there.
[49:32.220 --> 49:34.540]  Yeah, I was like 19 or something.
[49:34.540 --> 49:35.380]  Wow.
[49:35.380 --> 49:38.340]  Yeah, it was just like that.
[49:38.340 --> 49:39.540]  I don't know.
[49:40.180 --> 49:42.580]  I know you recently went, but yeah, yeah.
[49:42.580 --> 49:44.500]  It was an awesome fucking experience, dude.
[49:44.500 --> 49:48.500]  I mean, I, you know, I heard it's changing and stuff,
[49:48.500 --> 49:50.980]  but it was crazy.
[49:50.980 --> 49:52.620]  It was wild.
[49:52.620 --> 49:55.460]  The Bulldog, the Grasshopper.
[49:56.900 --> 49:59.860]  You definitely went during like the height of Amsterdam,
[49:59.860 --> 50:02.500]  like the nineties and the early 2000s.
[50:02.500 --> 50:05.540]  Like those were really the height of Amsterdam.
[50:05.540 --> 50:08.220]  It's gone backwards.
[50:08.220 --> 50:09.860]  It's still cool, but you know,
[50:09.860 --> 50:12.820]  19 was the first time I legally smoked in a cafe.
[50:12.820 --> 50:14.060]  It was in Vancouver, BC.
[50:14.060 --> 50:15.900]  It was Bulldog news back then.
[50:18.140 --> 50:21.100]  But yeah, dude, that was such a trip.
[50:21.100 --> 50:22.020]  So.
[50:22.020 --> 50:23.780]  Yeah, it's so awesome, man.
[50:23.780 --> 50:25.540]  Just go in there.
[50:25.540 --> 50:27.940]  All they ask is you buy like an orange juice or whatever.
[50:27.940 --> 50:29.140]  Like.
[50:29.140 --> 50:30.100]  It's like a damn strip club.
[50:30.100 --> 50:30.940]  Buy a drink.
[50:30.940 --> 50:31.780]  Yeah.
[50:31.780 --> 50:33.060]  Buy a drink, get a booze.
[50:33.060 --> 50:33.900]  Yeah, yeah.
[50:33.900 --> 50:35.900]  You can't even go into a bathroom there to take a piss.
[50:35.900 --> 50:36.940]  Like, you know what I'm saying?
[50:36.980 --> 50:38.500]  Like, what are you drinking?
[50:38.500 --> 50:40.140]  Like, oh, I'm just using the bathroom.
[50:40.140 --> 50:42.180]  Like, what are you drinking, sir?
[50:42.180 --> 50:44.740]  Like, you're from America, motherfucker.
[50:45.980 --> 50:46.820]  For real.
[50:46.820 --> 50:47.700]  Yeah, I know.
[50:47.700 --> 50:48.740]  Just watch your pockets.
[50:48.740 --> 50:50.500]  A lot of pickpockets and shit around there.
[50:50.500 --> 50:51.340]  They're, you know,
[50:51.340 --> 50:53.940]  they get kind of crazy in the red light district
[50:53.940 --> 50:55.380]  about three in the morning
[50:55.380 --> 50:57.580]  when it runs high on fucking ecstasy.
[50:59.100 --> 51:00.700]  Three in the morning in the red light district.
[51:00.700 --> 51:03.260]  You should know that's going to be a crazy time.
[51:03.260 --> 51:04.940]  If you see someone following you,
[51:05.820 --> 51:08.100]  they're not just because they like you.
[51:08.100 --> 51:10.380]  If you see a guy three blocks away, you know,
[51:10.380 --> 51:12.100]  like, why is this guy behind me still?
[51:12.100 --> 51:13.940]  Like, there's an issue.
[51:13.940 --> 51:14.780]  All right.
[51:14.780 --> 51:15.620]  So, Amsterdam.
[51:15.620 --> 51:18.420]  I've got, let's see, right here.
[51:18.420 --> 51:20.020]  Let me toss it here.
[51:20.020 --> 51:21.420]  I've got some greenhouse seeds.
[51:21.420 --> 51:24.020]  We've got a greenhouse cheese,
[51:24.020 --> 51:26.940]  which, you know, I'm always looking for that cheese.
[51:26.940 --> 51:28.780]  So we got a greenhouse cheese
[51:28.780 --> 51:31.860]  and we got a greenhouse momma kush.
[51:31.980 --> 51:36.980]  So, be interested to see how this works out.
[51:37.140 --> 51:39.140]  I mean, they've got some cool packaging.
[51:39.980 --> 51:42.740]  This was only like a one seed promo thing,
[51:42.740 --> 51:45.260]  but I'm like, okay, I'll pop it.
[51:45.260 --> 51:47.420]  Oh, I can't, why can't I get that one open now?
[51:47.420 --> 51:48.460]  I opened them before.
[51:48.460 --> 51:51.060]  Oh, well, they've got some pretty cool packaging.
[51:51.060 --> 51:52.100]  Ah, there we go.
[51:52.100 --> 51:55.180]  Slide it out and it's kind of like a little card.
[51:56.540 --> 51:59.100]  It's kind of a cool deal there.
[52:00.100 --> 52:02.300]  It's like a little metal.
[52:04.420 --> 52:05.260]  It looks like there's mercury,
[52:05.260 --> 52:06.580]  looks like a thermometer or something.
[52:06.580 --> 52:07.420]  Right?
[52:07.420 --> 52:08.260]  Right.
[52:08.260 --> 52:09.500]  It's solid though, man.
[52:09.500 --> 52:12.180]  It's, I'm trying to crush it and I can't.
[52:12.180 --> 52:15.100]  So that's gonna make it through like a mail sorter, man.
[52:15.100 --> 52:18.180]  It's not like some of these other things,
[52:18.180 --> 52:20.780]  but always send them in packages, man.
[52:21.860 --> 52:24.860]  But yeah, so a couple of greenhouse seeds here.
[52:24.860 --> 52:27.220]  I've got a couple other, you know,
[52:27.220 --> 52:29.580]  so like Big Buddha, Big Buddha was the guy
[52:29.580 --> 52:30.980]  who had Big Buddha's cheese,
[52:30.980 --> 52:33.060]  which I freaking absolutely love.
[52:33.060 --> 52:36.420]  And this is one of my favorite packaging that I have.
[52:36.420 --> 52:39.940]  Yeah, it's like a Buddha and the seeds are inside there.
[52:39.940 --> 52:41.340]  So they're in the bottom.
[52:42.580 --> 52:43.700]  Let's open up this pack.
[52:43.700 --> 52:46.100]  I don't think I have any Dutch shit,
[52:46.100 --> 52:48.100]  but let's see what I got in here
[52:48.100 --> 52:49.900]  out of all the Dutch blooms.
[52:49.900 --> 52:52.180]  Yeah, pull something that's close enough.
[52:52.180 --> 52:53.300]  It's Dutch.
[52:53.300 --> 52:55.420]  Yeah, it's Dutch blooms.
[52:55.420 --> 52:56.740]  That's my Dutch.
[52:57.260 --> 52:59.740]  All right, we'll just start, look.
[53:01.900 --> 53:02.740]  Damn, bro.
[53:04.620 --> 53:07.180]  Oh, geez, okay, I'm like, where is it?
[53:08.300 --> 53:09.500]  This is Mexican thyme.
[53:11.220 --> 53:13.220]  Lemon something or other.
[53:13.220 --> 53:15.300]  Blueberry muffin.
[53:15.300 --> 53:18.060]  I got some crickets and cicada from him.
[53:19.940 --> 53:22.140]  Okay, so which crickets and cicada?
[53:22.140 --> 53:23.580]  So that's Bob Hemphill,
[53:24.580 --> 53:26.860]  which he is an older cat.
[53:26.860 --> 53:30.300]  He does some of the preservation work and whatnot.
[53:30.300 --> 53:32.980]  But what do you got there as far as?
[53:32.980 --> 53:37.620]  The brood times SensiStar times Lazy Dog.
[53:37.620 --> 53:38.460]  Okay.
[53:38.460 --> 53:39.300]  The brood, right?
[53:39.300 --> 53:40.460]  And then what's this one?
[53:40.460 --> 53:41.300]  Trainwreck.
[53:43.180 --> 53:44.500]  It's Thai, so.
[53:44.500 --> 53:46.180]  Wow, that's.
[53:46.180 --> 53:48.260]  That's kind of Amsterdam-y, right?
[53:48.260 --> 53:51.100]  Yeah, I'm just thinking that's gonna be
[53:51.100 --> 53:53.500]  a tall, long flowering plant,
[53:54.380 --> 53:56.620]  which are nice, but I prefer other people grow them.
[53:56.620 --> 53:59.820]  We were talking earlier about flowering times
[53:59.820 --> 54:01.340]  and your preference.
[54:01.340 --> 54:03.140]  I like 60 days.
[54:04.300 --> 54:06.340]  If you don't do it in 60 days,
[54:06.340 --> 54:09.260]  you're not really likely gonna have a space in my tent,
[54:09.260 --> 54:11.700]  just the way the rotation and everything works, so.
[54:11.700 --> 54:13.820]  You still got stems in it still?
[54:13.820 --> 54:14.660]  Nice.
[54:14.660 --> 54:16.020]  Mac one times DL.
[54:16.020 --> 54:17.580]  What do you think DL means?
[54:17.580 --> 54:19.060]  Let's guess, anyone got a guess?
[54:19.060 --> 54:20.500]  I don't know, I'm just.
[54:20.500 --> 54:21.940]  Donkey lips.
[54:21.940 --> 54:22.780]  Donkey lips?
[54:23.100 --> 54:24.460]  That's what I'm going with.
[54:24.460 --> 54:26.780]  That's what I'm going with.
[54:28.500 --> 54:31.260]  Or it could have been do-si-licker, maybe.
[54:31.260 --> 54:35.140]  This is the one Dutch blooms that I do have.
[54:35.140 --> 54:37.340]  I got a couple do-si-lickers.
[54:37.340 --> 54:38.540]  Yeah, do-si-lickers.
[54:38.540 --> 54:39.660]  Yeah, looks like he had someone else
[54:39.660 --> 54:40.700]  writing that on there,
[54:40.700 --> 54:42.260]  cause his handwriting is bad.
[54:44.140 --> 54:48.980]  Yeah, this was a gift from another one of our guests
[54:48.980 --> 54:51.140]  that I've had on the show.
[54:51.140 --> 54:53.060]  So it might not be his handwriting,
[54:53.060 --> 54:55.460]  but this is my one Dutch bloom.
[54:55.460 --> 54:58.700]  This one says circle one farms, OG times Urkel,
[54:58.700 --> 55:00.900]  fire OG times Urkel.
[55:00.900 --> 55:02.900]  I'm just pulling these out kind of for the first time.
[55:02.900 --> 55:03.980]  I looked through these real quick.
[55:03.980 --> 55:04.820]  What's this one?
[55:05.940 --> 55:09.460]  I don't know, something times Mac muffin or Mac muffin.
[55:09.460 --> 55:10.780]  Right, they got some good.
[55:10.780 --> 55:12.020]  This is wall.
[55:12.020 --> 55:13.580]  That's some good graph writing.
[55:13.580 --> 55:15.780]  Look at this, a couple of crushed seeds
[55:15.780 --> 55:17.740]  and like two that made it.
[55:17.780 --> 55:21.820]  Mexi times, I don't know.
[55:21.820 --> 55:23.140]  This is the ones I like.
[55:23.140 --> 55:25.580]  I always just throw these ones in like, what's this?
[55:25.580 --> 55:28.900]  The paper in the bag.
[55:28.900 --> 55:31.980]  I know I've got, let's see, it broke my heart too.
[55:31.980 --> 55:33.300]  And I've never actually told him,
[55:33.300 --> 55:34.860]  I've never actually said this,
[55:34.860 --> 55:37.460]  but I don't think he watches the show.
[55:37.460 --> 55:38.660]  Here they are though.
[55:38.660 --> 55:43.380]  But James Loud, he had sent me some Blackberry
[55:43.380 --> 55:45.200]  or let's see here, let me put over.
[55:45.200 --> 55:47.260]  So Blackberry Tropicana.
[55:47.780 --> 55:50.700]  He had sent them to me and the bag he had sent them in,
[55:50.700 --> 55:55.700]  like 80% of them were crushed by the time they got to me.
[55:55.820 --> 55:59.900]  And I was just like, oh, I planted,
[55:59.900 --> 56:02.100]  I put a couple in that were just kind of had
[56:02.100 --> 56:03.900]  like the holes cracked,
[56:03.900 --> 56:06.620]  thinking maybe they would still germinate, but they didn't.
[56:06.620 --> 56:09.740]  So these are gonna get popped soon, but yeah.
[56:09.740 --> 56:11.340]  I mean, it was kind, it was a freebie.
[56:11.340 --> 56:14.100]  So I've never actually mentioned it to him, but yeah.
[56:14.100 --> 56:16.060]  You said crushed seeds and I'm just like,
[56:16.060 --> 56:19.180]  God damn it James, these would have been so good.
[56:19.180 --> 56:21.340]  Cause I asked him too, I'm like, can you give me some info?
[56:21.340 --> 56:22.440]  Like how long is it flower?
[56:22.440 --> 56:23.540]  What am I looking for?
[56:23.540 --> 56:24.700]  And he gave me a full detail.
[56:24.700 --> 56:26.540]  He's like, okay, well you're looking for the phenotype
[56:26.540 --> 56:29.900]  that is kind of like the Ryan of a watermelon
[56:29.900 --> 56:31.020]  and it's a little bit shorter
[56:31.020 --> 56:32.420]  and it's gonna go this many days.
[56:32.420 --> 56:34.700]  Like he had some excellent information for me.
[56:34.700 --> 56:39.340]  And then I was just like, oh mother, son of a bitch.
[56:39.340 --> 56:40.340]  But I think we're safe.
[56:40.340 --> 56:42.040]  I don't think he watches the show.
[56:43.000 --> 56:43.960]  Shout out to James Law.
[56:43.960 --> 56:45.160]  You know, he makes like what?
[56:45.160 --> 56:47.240]  20 million seeds of every cross he does.
[56:47.240 --> 56:49.800]  The guy makes five gallon bucket for shit.
[56:49.800 --> 56:50.640]  He's a ball pit.
[56:50.640 --> 56:52.160]  He has been working this last year.
[56:52.160 --> 56:54.400]  Like y'all are about to be blown away
[56:54.400 --> 56:56.560]  by what he is about to do.
[56:56.560 --> 57:01.560]  Like he's hinting at it on his Instagram, but yeah.
[57:01.640 --> 57:04.800]  He's, I'm hopefully gonna have him as a guest this month
[57:04.800 --> 57:06.600]  on future cannabis projects.
[57:06.600 --> 57:09.120]  I mean, shit, the dude has his own show, but I'm like,
[57:09.120 --> 57:11.000]  hey, how about being a guest this time?
[57:11.320 --> 57:12.160]  So.
[57:12.160 --> 57:13.000]  Yeah, he stopped doing it.
[57:13.000 --> 57:14.000]  Oh, well, I don't know if he stopped,
[57:14.000 --> 57:15.680]  but he was doing that show.
[57:15.680 --> 57:19.120]  Yeah, no, you can tell, I don't know him or anything,
[57:19.120 --> 57:21.960]  but yeah, he seems like a very knowledgeable
[57:21.960 --> 57:23.280]  kind of cool dude.
[57:23.280 --> 57:26.760]  I'm just gonna put some of these up as we, excuse me.

[57:34.160 --> 57:35.840]  2020 pre-release.
[57:36.560 --> 57:37.400]  I don't know.
[57:37.400 --> 57:38.600]  Is there, is this like a,
[57:38.600 --> 57:43.400]  is this a difference between gelato, the G-E-L-A-T-O,
[57:43.400 --> 57:47.920]  or is this just like people being cool?
[57:47.920 --> 57:49.520]  I'd say that's a whole different.
[57:49.520 --> 57:50.520]  This was a grab bag.
[57:50.520 --> 57:55.520]  So these are all the ones I was getting from Genetic Genetics.
[57:56.920 --> 57:59.800]  He's a Michigan guy and I do,
[57:59.800 --> 58:01.200]  I've never ran any of his stuff,
[58:01.200 --> 58:03.520]  but he's very generous when I see him.
[58:04.520 --> 58:06.920]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[58:06.920 --> 58:09.400]  Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't go away, dude.
[58:09.400 --> 58:10.240]  Don't go away yet.
[58:10.240 --> 58:11.880]  Don't go away yet.
[58:11.880 --> 58:13.280]  Come on.
[58:13.280 --> 58:15.160]  Some Genetic Genetics.
[58:16.360 --> 58:17.360]  Ken D.

[58:19.040 --> 58:24.040]  And Grand Traverse Tart Cherry.
[58:24.320 --> 58:26.040]  So he's got some of these.
[58:26.040 --> 58:27.280]  Came from James.
[58:27.280 --> 58:30.440]  Shout out to James, Joint Cultivation.
[58:30.440 --> 58:33.400]  I actually reached out to him earlier today
[58:34.280 --> 58:36.320]  when Dave was like, I'm sick, dude.
[58:36.320 --> 58:37.720]  I can't make it.
[58:37.720 --> 58:41.240]  I reached out to James, but he had sent me these.
[58:41.240 --> 58:43.640]  And Smiley, actually, I see him in chat now.
[58:43.640 --> 58:44.480]  Hey, buddy.
[58:44.480 --> 58:46.760]  We were talking, Four Eyes, Wise, or Four Wise Eyes.
[58:46.760 --> 58:47.720]  That's the name.
[58:47.720 --> 58:49.160]  He knew, he knew.
[58:50.360 --> 58:52.200]  So what you got in there?
[58:53.640 --> 58:55.120]  I don't know, Skunk Hayes.
[58:55.120 --> 58:58.600]  Look, these are all just came in that one auction pack.
[58:58.600 --> 58:59.520]  Oh, snaps.
[58:59.520 --> 59:01.000]  You're still in that same bag.
[59:01.000 --> 59:01.840]  I'm like digging through my whole collection.
[59:02.160 --> 59:04.120]  I'm just trying to flash through these
[59:04.120 --> 59:05.960]  because we're going through all at the same time
[59:05.960 --> 59:07.600]  as I'm actually reading what's here.
[59:07.600 --> 59:08.440]  Do it, do it.
[59:09.280 --> 59:10.800]  Double OG Cam.
[59:12.160 --> 59:15.440]  Holy Flame F1 2019.
[59:16.840 --> 59:17.680]  What's it say?
[59:17.680 --> 59:19.040]  I've not seen Holy Flame.
[59:20.480 --> 59:21.320]  I haven't either.
[59:21.320 --> 59:23.000]  It doesn't mean anything, but.
[59:23.000 --> 59:24.880]  That's what I like.
[59:24.880 --> 59:25.720]  What do we got?
[59:25.720 --> 59:26.560]  What is this?
[59:26.560 --> 59:27.480]  Pure Breeding.
[59:28.640 --> 59:29.920]  Afghani Custard.
[59:29.920 --> 59:30.760]  That's what I'm saying.
[59:30.800 --> 59:31.800]  It all came in that pack.
[59:31.800 --> 59:32.760]  Shout out to Dutch.
[59:33.840 --> 59:34.960]  Okay, that's awesome.
[59:34.960 --> 59:36.200]  I've never seen his packs before,
[59:36.200 --> 59:38.720]  but I see his stuff all the time.
[59:38.720 --> 59:39.880]  Or his posts all the time.
[59:39.880 --> 59:40.720]  Yeah.
[59:40.720 --> 59:41.560]  Yeah, yeah.
[59:42.640 --> 59:44.760]  Yeah, look, here's the one.
[59:44.760 --> 59:46.360]  Look at this.
[59:46.360 --> 59:48.320]  Looks like there's a fucking roach in here.
[59:48.320 --> 59:50.160]  No, it's just a pop.
[59:50.160 --> 59:51.000]  That's what I was saying.
[59:51.000 --> 59:52.160]  Look at that, a black roach.
[59:52.160 --> 59:54.120]  That one's got a piece of paper rolled up.
[59:54.120 --> 59:54.960]  I don't even know.
[59:54.960 --> 59:56.440]  Should we look?
[59:56.440 --> 59:57.280]  Let's look, man.
[59:57.280 --> 01:00:00.440]  Let's see if it's like a magical code.
[01:00:00.960 --> 01:00:04.720]  I'm trying to think of what's the weirdest thing
[01:00:04.720 --> 01:00:06.120]  I've been sent seeds in.
[01:00:07.280 --> 01:00:08.880]  I might take a look.
[01:00:08.880 --> 01:00:12.680]  Look, it's Kim 91 times.
[01:00:14.640 --> 01:00:17.120]  I guess ABC is what that says.
[01:00:17.120 --> 01:00:18.720]  People should write a little neater
[01:00:18.720 --> 01:00:20.760]  when they're doing it,
[01:00:20.760 --> 01:00:23.560]  because you never know who's gonna end up with the shit.
[01:00:23.560 --> 01:00:26.280]  And someone like me, I'm popping all these.
[01:00:26.280 --> 01:00:27.560]  I don't care.
[01:00:27.560 --> 01:00:29.960]  If not me, I'll force my children to pop them.
[01:00:30.960 --> 01:00:31.800]  Hell yeah.
[01:00:31.800 --> 01:00:34.720]  That's why label makers were invented.
[01:00:34.720 --> 01:00:36.200]  Damn, these look big as hell.
[01:00:36.200 --> 01:00:37.040]  What is this?
[01:00:37.040 --> 01:00:38.240]  Truth.
[01:00:38.240 --> 01:00:39.080]  The truth.
[01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:41.000]  It's got some other label.
[01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.000]  It says shark shock, but that's crossed out.
[01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:44.400]  Look at that, those look big.
[01:00:45.360 --> 01:00:46.200]  Oh, wow.
[01:00:46.200 --> 01:00:47.040]  Yeah.
[01:00:48.640 --> 01:00:50.280]  I gotta say, probably the biggest seeds
[01:00:50.280 --> 01:00:51.600]  I've been sent are kazoo.
[01:00:51.600 --> 01:00:52.480]  Kazoo Kush.
[01:00:52.480 --> 01:00:54.360]  He sent me some of his outdoor projects
[01:00:54.360 --> 01:00:57.040]  and dude, those are some of the biggest seeds
[01:00:57.040 --> 01:00:58.920]  I probably have.
[01:01:00.560 --> 01:01:01.880]  Is that all kazoo?
[01:01:01.880 --> 01:01:02.840]  Nice.
[01:01:02.840 --> 01:01:03.680]  Shout out Kazoo Kush.
[01:01:03.680 --> 01:01:05.120]  Me and Kabilla have done some,
[01:01:06.200 --> 01:01:07.480]  well, we did one cross.
[01:01:07.480 --> 01:01:08.840]  We're actually working on a new one too.
[01:01:08.840 --> 01:01:09.680]  We're doing it.
[01:01:09.680 --> 01:01:11.200]  We're making the F2s of the Chelsea
[01:01:11.200 --> 01:01:14.080]  with the blessing from Nick Risdon's Line Rising Farm.
[01:01:14.080 --> 01:01:14.920]  Nice.
[01:01:14.920 --> 01:01:19.040]  So I was actually just talking to Kazoo today about that.
[01:01:19.040 --> 01:01:21.480]  And yeah, he's got the male.
[01:01:21.480 --> 01:01:22.680]  I got the female.
[01:01:22.680 --> 01:01:24.200]  We're doing like, you know,
[01:01:24.200 --> 01:01:27.440]  like some pit bull backyard dog breeding shit, you know?
[01:01:27.440 --> 01:01:28.280]  Yeah.
[01:01:29.240 --> 01:01:30.560]  Let's bring your doggy over here.
[01:01:30.560 --> 01:01:31.920]  Let's get him out of here.
[01:01:33.320 --> 01:01:35.280]  So we're putting that together.
[01:01:35.280 --> 01:01:36.400]  Bring that, Paul.
[01:01:36.400 --> 01:01:37.840]  With the blessing from Nick,
[01:01:39.240 --> 01:01:42.960]  we all kind of did a little fireside chat about it
[01:01:42.960 --> 01:01:45.960]  during his wedding, during his bachelor party
[01:01:45.960 --> 01:01:46.800]  and all that.
[01:01:46.800 --> 01:01:49.440]  So shout out to Line Rising Farm.
[01:01:49.440 --> 01:01:50.920]  Shout out to Shannon.
[01:01:50.920 --> 01:01:51.760]  Yeah.
[01:01:51.760 --> 01:01:53.040]  Congratulations to both of them.
[01:01:53.040 --> 01:01:54.240]  Thank you, sir.
[01:01:54.240 --> 01:01:56.720]  Marriage, recent son.
[01:01:56.720 --> 01:01:57.560]  Yep.
[01:01:58.040 --> 01:01:59.400]  Little man, Lincoln.
[01:01:59.400 --> 01:02:00.640]  Lincoln, I believe his name is.
[01:02:00.640 --> 01:02:02.880]  Yeah, he's very, very cute little kid.
[01:02:02.880 --> 01:02:03.960]  He seems like a,
[01:02:05.520 --> 01:02:07.040]  you know, I was even telling Nick, I said,
[01:02:07.040 --> 01:02:08.360]  oh, I can't wait till, you know,
[01:02:08.360 --> 01:02:09.680]  your boy grows up a little bit
[01:02:09.680 --> 01:02:11.040]  and then I'll bring my son over
[01:02:11.040 --> 01:02:13.440]  and they'll both run around and, you know,
[01:02:13.440 --> 01:02:15.200]  shoot baby guns and.
[01:02:15.200 --> 01:02:16.040]  Yeah.
[01:02:16.040 --> 01:02:17.880]  One pump, man.
[01:02:17.880 --> 01:02:20.800]  You pumped it twice.
[01:02:20.800 --> 01:02:21.640]  All right, I'm okay.
[01:02:21.640 --> 01:02:22.640]  I'm gonna just run through this back
[01:02:22.640 --> 01:02:23.480]  so we get through this.
[01:02:23.480 --> 01:02:24.320]  Hit it, hit it.
[01:02:24.320 --> 01:02:25.240]  Just cause it's crazy.
[01:02:25.240 --> 01:02:26.960]  That's what the people love.
[01:02:27.040 --> 01:02:28.000]  Egyptian.
[01:02:29.600 --> 01:02:31.200]  Egyptian.
[01:02:31.200 --> 01:02:32.040]  X.
[01:02:32.040 --> 01:02:32.880]  Black Latin.
[01:02:32.880 --> 01:02:33.720]  I don't know.
[01:02:33.720 --> 01:02:35.280]  I'll put it up on YouTube if you can read it.
[01:02:36.680 --> 01:02:37.680]  It was like two or three.
[01:02:37.680 --> 01:02:38.520]  Those are big ass seeds.
[01:02:38.520 --> 01:02:42.560]  Egyptian something times Calio, which is awesome.
[01:02:42.560 --> 01:02:47.560]  Yeah, times 18 Pakistani times Calio times Vietnamese F1.
[01:02:48.240 --> 01:02:49.400]  See?
[01:02:49.400 --> 01:02:51.400]  Yeah, if there's only like four or five seeds in there,
[01:02:51.400 --> 01:02:52.720]  you know those are going in.
[01:02:52.720 --> 01:02:55.000]  It's like, go in there.
[01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:55.840]  Shit.
[01:02:56.280 --> 01:02:58.080]  The main person getting my money nowadays
[01:02:58.080 --> 01:03:01.880]  and I'm doing everything organic and regenerative style
[01:03:01.880 --> 01:03:05.760]  is the guy by, you know, selling me the plant tags.
[01:03:07.760 --> 01:03:08.960]  That's my main supplier.
[01:03:09.840 --> 01:03:11.600]  You don't flip them over?
[01:03:11.600 --> 01:03:12.440]  Yeah, I know.
[01:03:12.440 --> 01:03:14.480]  Look, I go to a grocery store.
[01:03:14.480 --> 01:03:17.400]  They're like, you buy an awful lot of plant tags
[01:03:17.400 --> 01:03:18.240]  and nothing else.
[01:03:18.240 --> 01:03:19.080]  Like, yeah, that's right.
[01:03:19.080 --> 01:03:21.360]  I make my own soil, motherfuckers.
[01:03:21.360 --> 01:03:22.200]  What do we got here?
[01:03:22.200 --> 01:03:25.160]  The beans times Max Stomper.
[01:03:25.200 --> 01:03:27.280]  Max Stomper, okay.
[01:03:27.280 --> 01:03:30.040]  I've never grown a Mac.
[01:03:30.040 --> 01:03:32.680]  I don't know a whole bunch about it, you know.
[01:03:32.680 --> 01:03:35.440]  I've heard that it's a slow veger from people,
[01:03:35.440 --> 01:03:37.400]  but then I've also heard, no, it's not.
[01:03:37.400 --> 01:03:41.280]  Which then again leads me to the whole providence issue
[01:03:41.280 --> 01:03:44.520]  of like, well, did you get it from a European country
[01:03:44.520 --> 01:03:45.680]  that said Mac on it?
[01:03:45.680 --> 01:03:47.680]  Because I can tell you that's not the Mac
[01:03:47.680 --> 01:03:50.360]  from Capitulator or Cap or whatever.
[01:03:51.440 --> 01:03:53.600]  Anything that's popular will get knockoffs.
[01:03:53.640 --> 01:03:56.320]  So it's hard to keep the story straight sometimes.
[01:03:58.640 --> 01:03:59.480]  What is that my shit?
[01:03:59.480 --> 01:04:00.800]  Look, Icy Mac.
[01:04:00.800 --> 01:04:03.440]  I know these guys Instagram on their unity farms.
[01:04:03.440 --> 01:04:05.040]  Is that what it says?
[01:04:05.040 --> 01:04:06.960]  Unity farms with a Z, shout out.
[01:04:06.960 --> 01:04:08.520]  I'm about to be growing your shit.
[01:04:08.520 --> 01:04:10.280]  Icy Mac.
[01:04:10.280 --> 01:04:12.280]  This is still from this package.
[01:04:12.280 --> 01:04:15.040]  Well, we'll say it's undisclosed amount what I paid,
[01:04:15.040 --> 01:04:16.800]  but I got a hell of a deal.
[01:04:16.800 --> 01:04:18.160]  I'll tell you that much.
[01:04:18.160 --> 01:04:19.360]  This one looks good.
[01:04:19.360 --> 01:04:22.680]  Sour Dub, reverse times chem 91.
[01:04:22.680 --> 01:04:24.760]  Is that a, wow.
[01:04:24.760 --> 01:04:25.600]  Okay.
[01:04:25.600 --> 01:04:27.000]  Skunk foot seeds.
[01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:27.840]  Okay.
[01:04:27.840 --> 01:04:28.960]  I like the logo there.
[01:04:28.960 --> 01:04:30.280]  Oh, look.
[01:04:30.280 --> 01:04:31.120]  It's a skunk foot.
[01:04:31.120 --> 01:04:31.960]  It's a mouse water.
[01:04:31.960 --> 01:04:32.800]  It's a pistol.
[01:04:32.800 --> 01:04:34.520]  Look, it's got a pistol on it.
[01:04:34.520 --> 01:04:35.520]  I like that.
[01:04:35.520 --> 01:04:37.880]  Nice logo, skunk foot seeds.
[01:04:37.880 --> 01:04:39.240]  You're watching.
[01:04:39.240 --> 01:04:40.240]  You're seeing this.
[01:04:41.480 --> 01:04:42.320]  Damn, dude, there's still a-
[01:04:42.320 --> 01:04:45.160]  Real potential there with the strains.
[01:04:45.160 --> 01:04:47.360]  Again, me being that chem 91 lover.
[01:04:48.440 --> 01:04:49.680]  I don't wanna mix these up.
[01:04:49.680 --> 01:04:51.800]  What did I get closest to chem 91?
[01:04:51.800 --> 01:04:55.000]  Mr. Toad actually did send me a Toad's 91.
[01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:56.800]  I got some Toad's 91 here.
[01:04:56.800 --> 01:05:01.280]  That is his, well, the chem 91 that he holds
[01:05:01.280 --> 01:05:06.280]  times the ghost OG times chem doc special reserve.
[01:05:06.960 --> 01:05:10.920]  So yeah, Toad's 91 is closer,
[01:05:10.920 --> 01:05:14.280]  helping me get closer to that hunt of the-
[01:05:14.280 --> 01:05:17.920]  If anyone's got a boneyard seeds, I will say this.
[01:05:17.920 --> 01:05:19.040]  I'll say this right now.
[01:05:19.040 --> 01:05:19.880]  And I don't bullshit.
[01:05:19.880 --> 01:05:20.720]  If I don't like your seeds,
[01:05:20.840 --> 01:05:22.040]  I just won't say anything about them.
[01:05:22.040 --> 01:05:22.880]  I'm that guy, right?
[01:05:22.880 --> 01:05:24.720]  I'm not gonna dog anybody.
[01:05:24.720 --> 01:05:27.720]  But Mr. Toad shit, everything I've grown from him
[01:05:27.720 --> 01:05:28.720]  has come out nice.
[01:05:28.720 --> 01:05:29.560]  You know what I'm saying?
[01:05:29.560 --> 01:05:31.360]  It's good shit.
[01:05:31.360 --> 01:05:32.200]  What have I done?
[01:05:32.200 --> 01:05:35.600]  I've done the one hitter quitter, which was great.
[01:05:35.600 --> 01:05:36.800]  And I still have a bunch of seeds.
[01:05:36.800 --> 01:05:39.600]  So I'm just gonna have to find it back.
[01:05:39.600 --> 01:05:43.160]  I've done the Bob's cheddar and I've done the ganjo G.
[01:05:43.160 --> 01:05:45.000]  And all three of them are fucking off.
[01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:46.520]  I mean, they're good ass shit.
[01:05:46.520 --> 01:05:48.960]  So the guy does great work.
[01:05:48.960 --> 01:05:50.680]  So if you've got some of the seeds, pop them
[01:05:51.520 --> 01:05:53.920]  because you know, Mr. Toad sells this shit for,
[01:05:53.920 --> 01:05:55.360]  I think cheaper than he should,
[01:05:55.360 --> 01:05:57.560]  but that's none of my business.
[01:05:57.560 --> 01:05:59.200]  Something else.
[01:05:59.200 --> 01:06:00.440]  How many packs are we at now?
[01:06:00.440 --> 01:06:01.440]  Is anyone counting?
[01:06:01.440 --> 01:06:04.200]  There's a lot of packs I got for fucking,
[01:06:04.200 --> 01:06:05.680]  we'll say less than $500.
[01:06:05.680 --> 01:06:06.520]  I'm telling you that.
[01:06:06.520 --> 01:06:08.560]  Oh, good, what?
[01:06:08.560 --> 01:06:10.760]  Yeah, I know all these King Louie.
[01:06:11.880 --> 01:06:14.600]  King Louie times purple unicorn.
[01:06:14.600 --> 01:06:17.560]  Nice, somebody was talking about purple unicorn earlier.
[01:06:17.560 --> 01:06:20.480]  Purple unicorn times like a cherry limeade something.
[01:06:21.640 --> 01:06:22.760]  Scroll up.
[01:06:22.760 --> 01:06:27.520]  Apple Sunday times Island vibes, feminized.
[01:06:27.520 --> 01:06:29.280]  I mean, some of these are like three seeds in there.
[01:06:29.280 --> 01:06:30.120]  I get it.
[01:06:31.200 --> 01:06:32.040]  A little sample.
[01:06:33.360 --> 01:06:36.600]  Do you get a lot of, or do you really know the difference?
[01:06:36.600 --> 01:06:39.800]  Well, when you get the seeds, do you get a lot of regulars?
[01:06:39.800 --> 01:06:42.640]  I've noticed people that have fems or give out fems,
[01:06:42.640 --> 01:06:45.120]  like three is a popular number,
[01:06:45.120 --> 01:06:48.960]  which I guess if you're not weeding through males,
[01:06:48.960 --> 01:06:51.120]  three is, you know.
[01:06:51.120 --> 01:06:54.240]  Right, I mean, I normally don't buy fems.
[01:06:54.240 --> 01:06:56.000]  I mean, I have some fems and stuff,
[01:06:56.000 --> 01:07:00.040]  but because I do like breeding, you know what I mean?
[01:07:00.040 --> 01:07:03.920]  I like to, I'll keep, when I'm female hunting,
[01:07:03.920 --> 01:07:07.840]  I'll just keep, like after I sex them and stuff,
[01:07:07.840 --> 01:07:09.880]  I'll be like, oh, this is the best looking male.
[01:07:09.880 --> 01:07:11.160]  And I'll just keep it to the side.
[01:07:11.160 --> 01:07:12.000]  You know what I mean?
[01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.760]  What I'll do is just prune it down to like a little nub.
[01:07:15.400 --> 01:07:17.040]  And then if I do want to breed with it,
[01:07:17.040 --> 01:07:19.240]  like after I flower out the female,
[01:07:19.240 --> 01:07:20.960]  like, oh, this is some cool shit.
[01:07:20.960 --> 01:07:22.160]  Then I'll say, or I'll say,
[01:07:22.160 --> 01:07:23.680]  oh, this is kind of some bullshit.
[01:07:23.680 --> 01:07:25.520]  And I'll just piss the male.
[01:07:25.520 --> 01:07:26.800]  But yeah, I'll just trim it back.
[01:07:26.800 --> 01:07:27.640]  You know what I mean?
[01:07:27.640 --> 01:07:30.080]  I just chop the top off and keep it like this.
[01:07:30.080 --> 01:07:31.320]  So you barely have to water it.
[01:07:31.320 --> 01:07:32.160]  You know what I mean?
[01:07:32.160 --> 01:07:32.980]  And just a couple of little nodes,
[01:07:32.980 --> 01:07:35.440]  let it grow back, chop it off.
[01:07:35.440 --> 01:07:36.520]  And then, you know what I mean?
[01:07:36.520 --> 01:07:38.040]  Just keep it in the corner.
[01:07:38.960 --> 01:07:40.200]  Whenever you're doing your IPM,
[01:07:40.200 --> 01:07:43.480]  just put it in the hose over there
[01:07:43.600 --> 01:07:44.800]  and make sure you get that one too.
[01:07:44.800 --> 01:07:46.520]  You know what I mean?
[01:07:46.520 --> 01:07:47.360]  Yeah.
[01:07:47.360 --> 01:07:48.920]  Well, I, you know, I like that too,
[01:07:48.920 --> 01:07:50.280]  because when you do it that way,
[01:07:50.280 --> 01:07:52.280]  I mean, there are many reasons.
[01:07:52.280 --> 01:07:53.880]  One, obviously grow out a strain,
[01:07:53.880 --> 01:07:56.040]  be familiar with it before you decide to breed with it.
[01:07:56.040 --> 01:07:57.920]  But when you do keep that male short
[01:07:57.920 --> 01:08:01.440]  and you keep chopping it as the other things grow out,
[01:08:01.440 --> 01:08:03.560]  if you do like it and you like what you have,
[01:08:03.560 --> 01:08:05.240]  by the time that, you know,
[01:08:06.400 --> 01:08:07.880]  by the time you're ready to make seeds,
[01:08:07.880 --> 01:08:12.120]  that male is just like a monster of just like awesome prune
[01:08:12.120 --> 01:08:12.960]  basically.
[01:08:12.960 --> 01:08:13.800]  Yeah.
[01:08:13.800 --> 01:08:15.800]  So then just, yeah, give it, yeah.
[01:08:15.800 --> 01:08:17.800]  Put it right under the light and feed it a little bit
[01:08:17.800 --> 01:08:19.520]  and just let it blow up and boom.
[01:08:19.520 --> 01:08:21.560]  And then, you know, then you just throw it in the,
[01:08:21.560 --> 01:08:22.840]  you know, throw it in the tent
[01:08:22.840 --> 01:08:25.680]  with all your verified cuts are.
[01:08:26.960 --> 01:08:28.360]  It might maybe a couple hours
[01:08:28.360 --> 01:08:30.000]  before we get through this bag.
[01:08:32.120 --> 01:08:32.960]  How about this one?
[01:08:32.960 --> 01:08:33.800]  This one looks good.
[01:08:33.800 --> 01:08:37.280]  Cheesy four times Royal Kush times Sky Color Kush.
[01:08:37.280 --> 01:08:39.080]  That's up my alley right there.
[01:08:39.080 --> 01:08:40.240]  Nice.
[01:08:40.240 --> 01:08:41.200]  That sounds nice.
[01:08:41.200 --> 01:08:45.640]  And Dave's night here is in the building.
[01:08:45.640 --> 01:08:49.640]  He's, I remember that auction he got the seed hoard from.
[01:08:51.400 --> 01:08:52.240]  We lied, Dave.
[01:08:52.240 --> 01:08:55.200]  I told everybody you spontaneously combusted
[01:08:55.200 --> 01:08:57.800]  because your collection was just too hot.
[01:09:00.280 --> 01:09:01.880]  I wanna grow some of the blueberry muffin
[01:09:01.880 --> 01:09:04.120]  from Humboldt seeds.
[01:09:04.120 --> 01:09:05.800]  That's on my list to do.
[01:09:05.800 --> 01:09:06.880]  Yeah.
[01:09:06.880 --> 01:09:11.880]  That has like a 45 day, 50 day maturity window
[01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:13.360]  and turps up the yin yang.
[01:09:13.360 --> 01:09:15.440]  So I'm like, win and win.
[01:09:15.440 --> 01:09:17.040]  What is this?
[01:09:17.040 --> 01:09:20.280]  Sapphire seeds, Phantom of the Woods.
[01:09:21.600 --> 01:09:22.440]  Okay.
[01:09:23.760 --> 01:09:25.600]  We're almost through this thing.
[01:09:25.600 --> 01:09:27.440]  Dave, I'm sorry you have to,
[01:09:27.440 --> 01:09:29.120]  all right, I already showed that one, right?
[01:09:29.120 --> 01:09:31.280]  Yeah, Apple Sunday, Island Vibes.
[01:09:32.200 --> 01:09:35.400]  Another one of these, the map crosses where they,
[01:09:35.400 --> 01:09:37.440]  you could tell this guy probably does graffiti.
[01:09:37.440 --> 01:09:38.400]  He does.
[01:09:38.400 --> 01:09:40.520]  I'm like his lettering is tight.
[01:09:40.520 --> 01:09:41.920]  His lettering game is tight.
[01:09:41.920 --> 01:09:42.760]  Yeah.
[01:09:44.200 --> 01:09:46.400]  Just wear a fucking bandana at least.
[01:09:46.400 --> 01:09:48.080]  So you don't, you know what I'm saying?
[01:09:48.080 --> 01:09:50.440]  I know a couple of cats that were real into that.
[01:09:50.440 --> 01:09:52.440]  They kind of messed up their brains from.
[01:09:52.440 --> 01:09:53.280]  Yeah.
[01:09:56.440 --> 01:09:59.440]  501st OG, 51st.
[01:09:59.440 --> 01:10:03.360]  Okay, I got there'll be 51st OG times Purple Gelato.
[01:10:03.360 --> 01:10:05.280]  That's Dungeon Vault.
[01:10:06.160 --> 01:10:07.880]  And hey, I don't want anyone poking fun at me
[01:10:07.880 --> 01:10:09.400]  cause I don't know all these, you know.
[01:10:09.400 --> 01:10:12.320]  We're not, no, I'm actually laughing right now
[01:10:12.320 --> 01:10:15.560]  because I'll put this up in chat.
[01:10:15.560 --> 01:10:16.400]  Let's see here.
[01:10:16.400 --> 01:10:17.800]  Let me get my stuff out here.
[01:10:17.800 --> 01:10:18.920]  Where is it?
[01:10:18.920 --> 01:10:20.600]  Where is it?
[01:10:20.600 --> 01:10:22.480]  If you see Dutch Blitz online,
[01:10:22.480 --> 01:10:24.480]  you better jump on there real quick
[01:10:24.480 --> 01:10:26.520]  cause you never know what can happen.
[01:10:26.520 --> 01:10:27.760]  This is definitely the best deal
[01:10:27.760 --> 01:10:29.680]  I've ever gotten at fucking auction.
[01:10:29.680 --> 01:10:30.520]  Oh my God.
[01:10:32.400 --> 01:10:35.200]  Dude, all of that, holy jeez.
[01:10:36.120 --> 01:10:36.960]  That's a lot of cool stuff, right?
[01:10:36.960 --> 01:10:39.280]  And you paid like a dollar a seed, man.
[01:10:39.280 --> 01:10:42.600]  Oh yeah, I think I paid less than a dollar a seed, man.
[01:10:42.600 --> 01:10:44.800]  So we, you know, we were comparing seeds earlier
[01:10:44.800 --> 01:10:47.600]  and we just got called out for the Macho Man.
[01:10:47.600 --> 01:10:50.440]  So you got Macho Man behind you, I see that.
[01:10:51.480 --> 01:10:53.240]  But you know what?
[01:10:53.240 --> 01:10:55.560]  I raise you my Macho Man.
[01:10:55.560 --> 01:10:59.280]  Oh, you got the Slim Jims in there?
[01:10:59.280 --> 01:11:00.120]  No.
[01:11:00.120 --> 01:11:00.960]  That's what this is, right?
[01:11:00.960 --> 01:11:01.800]  Yeah, that's the Slim Jims.
[01:11:01.800 --> 01:11:02.640]  These are my mailers.
[01:11:02.640 --> 01:11:03.960]  These are my mailers for-
[01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.240]  Okay, yeah, hell yeah.
[01:11:06.240 --> 01:11:07.560]  Oh no, this is way better.
[01:11:07.560 --> 01:11:09.400]  I paid a hundred bucks for this.
[01:11:09.400 --> 01:11:11.400]  I bought it off the guy at the gas station.
[01:11:11.400 --> 01:11:15.320]  I go, hey, you guys, would you sell me this?
[01:11:15.320 --> 01:11:17.160]  And they go, actually we do sell those.
[01:11:17.160 --> 01:11:18.360]  I said, what?
[01:11:18.360 --> 01:11:19.720]  We have four of them.
[01:11:19.720 --> 01:11:20.800]  They're a hundred dollars each.
[01:11:20.800 --> 01:11:22.680]  I said, a hundred bucks?
[01:11:22.680 --> 01:11:23.760]  I go, no fucking way, man.
[01:11:23.760 --> 01:11:25.320]  I was like, I'll give you 50 bucks.
[01:11:25.320 --> 01:11:27.440]  They're like, no, man, the owner said it's a hundred.
[01:11:27.440 --> 01:11:31.000]  And like, no, we're not bartering on this.
[01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:31.840]  Right.
[01:11:31.840 --> 01:11:32.680]  I was like, all right.
[01:11:33.320 --> 01:11:34.760]  I went home, I thought about it.
[01:11:34.760 --> 01:11:37.560]  And the next day I might've had a couple of cocktails.
[01:11:37.560 --> 01:11:39.800]  I was like, all right, here's a hundred bucks.
[01:11:39.800 --> 01:11:41.840]  I mean, you know, I gotta have it.
[01:11:43.520 --> 01:11:45.160]  Life of a collector.
[01:11:45.160 --> 01:11:46.480]  Right, yeah, this is what happened
[01:11:46.480 --> 01:11:47.960]  when you took them to the counter at the liquor store.
[01:11:47.960 --> 01:11:48.800]  You know what I'm saying?
[01:11:48.800 --> 01:11:49.640]  Yeah.
[01:11:49.640 --> 01:11:50.480]  Yeah.
[01:11:50.480 --> 01:11:51.320]  Yeah, fuck yeah.
[01:11:51.320 --> 01:11:52.920]  Life as a collector, man.
[01:11:52.920 --> 01:11:53.760]  That's awesome.
[01:11:55.480 --> 01:11:56.920]  Yeah, I collect shit.
[01:11:56.920 --> 01:11:59.480]  I mean, I don't really collect shit anymore.
[01:11:59.480 --> 01:12:00.720]  I got a bunch of beer steins,
[01:12:00.720 --> 01:12:02.560]  but they were all my grandpa's.
[01:12:03.440 --> 01:12:04.280]  I got some bobbleheads.
[01:12:04.280 --> 01:12:05.440]  That's actually kind of extra special.
[01:12:05.440 --> 01:12:06.840]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:12:06.840 --> 01:12:08.240]  So I don't know if they're worth anything.
[01:12:08.240 --> 01:12:10.280]  I got a bunch of bobbleheads and I only,
[01:12:11.600 --> 01:12:12.560]  I've never like bought one.
[01:12:12.560 --> 01:12:14.960]  They're all ones I've got at ball games and stuff.
[01:12:14.960 --> 01:12:16.680]  Nice, that's cool.
[01:12:16.680 --> 01:12:18.240]  Autographed baseballs.
[01:12:18.240 --> 01:12:19.840]  I don't want to incriminate myself.
[01:12:19.840 --> 01:12:20.680]  No, no.
[01:12:20.680 --> 01:12:21.520]  I always-
[01:12:21.520 --> 01:12:24.080]  I'm hearing the man cave looking.
[01:12:25.680 --> 01:12:27.040]  I mean, I always do like to ask,
[01:12:27.040 --> 01:12:30.440]  cause you know, collecting is kind of like
[01:12:30.440 --> 01:12:31.360]  something people do.
[01:12:31.400 --> 01:12:32.680]  It may be like shoes.
[01:12:32.680 --> 01:12:34.680]  Sometimes it's seeds, you know,
[01:12:34.680 --> 01:12:36.040]  so it's vegetable seeds,
[01:12:36.040 --> 01:12:39.240]  but I've never met a seed collector that's like,
[01:12:39.240 --> 01:12:41.560]  no, I don't collect anything else.
[01:12:41.560 --> 01:12:42.400]  Yeah.
[01:12:42.400 --> 01:12:43.640]  It's always like a lifelong thing.
[01:12:43.640 --> 01:12:46.120]  I think I probably started with baseball cards.
[01:12:46.120 --> 01:12:47.120]  Yeah, for sure.
[01:12:47.120 --> 01:12:50.640]  I was big on baseball cards when I was a younger.
[01:12:50.640 --> 01:12:51.640]  I mean, I used to,
[01:12:51.640 --> 01:12:53.680]  remember them baseball card shows?
[01:12:53.680 --> 01:12:55.520]  Oh dude, I used to do those as a kid.
[01:12:55.520 --> 01:12:57.840]  Or to the church or the Holiday Inn and shit.
[01:12:57.840 --> 01:12:58.680]  Yeah.
[01:12:58.680 --> 01:12:59.520]  Oh my God.
[01:12:59.520 --> 01:13:00.440]  The Holiday Inn, bro.
[01:13:00.440 --> 01:13:02.840]  Hell yeah, go to the Holiday Inn.
[01:13:02.840 --> 01:13:06.120]  And there'd be all these like kind of shady older guys.
[01:13:06.120 --> 01:13:06.960]  You know what I mean?
[01:13:06.960 --> 01:13:07.800]  Like-
[01:13:07.800 --> 01:13:09.360]  It's the coolest thing cause you're a little kid.
[01:13:09.360 --> 01:13:10.200]  Like my dad-
[01:13:10.200 --> 01:13:11.040]  No, it was awesome.
[01:13:11.040 --> 01:13:11.880]  It was awesome.
[01:13:11.880 --> 01:13:13.280]  Like, and you know what I mean?
[01:13:13.280 --> 01:13:15.000]  Like, you think about it,
[01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.160]  the baseball, they say they're worth this much money.
[01:13:17.160 --> 01:13:18.000]  But it's like,
[01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:20.560]  who's gonna pay for a fucking 10,000,
[01:13:20.560 --> 01:13:21.400]  you know what I mean?
[01:13:21.400 --> 01:13:23.480]  You know, I mean, I guess maybe for like a,
[01:13:23.480 --> 01:13:25.240]  whatever a Honus Wagner,
[01:13:25.240 --> 01:13:26.080]  a Babe Ruth card.
[01:13:26.080 --> 01:13:26.920]  Babe Ruth, yeah.
[01:13:26.920 --> 01:13:28.040]  Yeah.
[01:13:28.040 --> 01:13:29.520]  Well, you know, like my dad, you know,
[01:13:29.520 --> 01:13:30.960]  cause he taught me and he's, you know,
[01:13:30.960 --> 01:13:33.120]  he was a marketing person.
[01:13:33.120 --> 01:13:35.480]  And so like, he kind of let me learn young,
[01:13:35.480 --> 01:13:36.720]  like how things worked.
[01:13:36.720 --> 01:13:38.440]  Like he would, he's, you know,
[01:13:38.440 --> 01:13:40.480]  he would let me get a table at these card shows
[01:13:40.480 --> 01:13:41.880]  and I built my own little box.
[01:13:41.880 --> 01:13:42.720]  Wow, yeah.
[01:13:42.720 --> 01:13:46.440]  He would let me, you know, succeed or fail on my own.
[01:13:46.440 --> 01:13:48.400]  And there'd always be a lesson at it.
[01:13:48.400 --> 01:13:49.320]  Yeah.
[01:13:49.320 --> 01:13:51.200]  But, you know, he always told me too,
[01:13:51.200 --> 01:13:53.080]  it's like, it's just a piece of cardboard.
[01:13:53.080 --> 01:13:55.520]  It's not worth anything until you have a buyer.
[01:13:55.520 --> 01:13:56.400]  Right.
[01:13:56.400 --> 01:13:58.000]  Remember Pogs?
[01:13:58.000 --> 01:13:59.080]  Speaking of pieces of cardboard.
[01:13:59.600 --> 01:14:01.440]  I didn't collect them, but I do remember that.
[01:14:01.440 --> 01:14:03.400]  Yeah, they had the, you had like the thick,
[01:14:03.400 --> 01:14:04.240]  Slammer.
[01:14:04.240 --> 01:14:05.080]  Slammer, yeah.
[01:14:05.080 --> 01:14:09.720]  I remember having the Pogs when I was, you know, whatever.
[01:14:10.760 --> 01:14:14.000]  I want to get a shout out from like anybody in chat.
[01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:16.760]  If you were in on the Pogs craze, let us know, dude,
[01:14:16.760 --> 01:14:19.320]  because I haven't thought about that for a while.
[01:14:19.320 --> 01:14:21.200]  But that was huge.
[01:14:21.200 --> 01:14:23.440]  Comic books, but comic books are like,
[01:14:25.080 --> 01:14:26.920]  I don't know, just like when I was a kid,
[01:14:26.920 --> 01:14:27.760]  I don't know.
[01:14:27.760 --> 01:14:28.800]  Yeah, I was more into baseball cards.
[01:14:29.520 --> 01:14:30.360]  I mean, I had some comics and shit,
[01:14:30.360 --> 01:14:33.280]  but I'm more just like, I had a couple of cool ones.
[01:14:34.240 --> 01:14:37.840]  Kazoo knows about the wax packs,
[01:14:37.840 --> 01:14:39.440]  where they would carefully open them,
[01:14:39.440 --> 01:14:42.400]  take out the good cards and then seal it back
[01:14:42.400 --> 01:14:45.160]  before they started going to the foil wrappers.
[01:14:45.160 --> 01:14:47.040]  Wax packs.
[01:14:47.040 --> 01:14:51.480]  My son, like I said, he's only in kindergarten,
[01:14:51.480 --> 01:14:53.880]  but he's, I guess on the bus,
[01:14:53.880 --> 01:14:56.160]  they trade Pokemon cards, right?
[01:14:56.160 --> 01:14:57.000]  Oh yeah.
[01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:58.160]  That's huge.
[01:14:58.200 --> 01:15:02.840]  Yeah, my girl, she used to have some Pokemon cards
[01:15:02.840 --> 01:15:04.880]  and shit, I never, I'm too old for that.
[01:15:04.880 --> 01:15:09.320]  But she's got some and she's like,
[01:15:09.320 --> 01:15:10.720]  I'm like, you know, some of these are worth
[01:15:10.720 --> 01:15:11.560]  a bunch of money.
[01:15:11.560 --> 01:15:12.800]  Like at least Ms. Sonic would give us
[01:15:12.800 --> 01:15:14.840]  some fucking season with some of these shit.
[01:15:14.840 --> 01:15:16.040]  Like make sure you're not giving him
[01:15:16.040 --> 01:15:17.720]  like the real valuable ones to trade,
[01:15:17.720 --> 01:15:18.560]  you know what I mean?
[01:15:18.560 --> 01:15:20.040]  Cause she's like, oh, here's some.
[01:15:20.040 --> 01:15:22.200]  And then he comes back with some other ones,
[01:15:22.200 --> 01:15:23.600]  you know, but they're all like grubbed up
[01:15:23.600 --> 01:15:26.080]  and bent up and shit, you know, it's all fun.
[01:15:26.120 --> 01:15:28.880]  It is, I mean, that's why I still have my baseball cards
[01:15:28.880 --> 01:15:29.960]  and kept them in good collection.
[01:15:29.960 --> 01:15:31.680]  Cause I remember reading the Beckett magazine
[01:15:31.680 --> 01:15:34.280]  and be like, Mickey Mantles, Ricky's like $20,000.
[01:15:34.280 --> 01:15:35.280]  And you know, as a kid, you're like,
[01:15:35.280 --> 01:15:37.400]  you can buy the world for that.
[01:15:37.400 --> 01:15:38.680]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:15:38.680 --> 01:15:41.080]  I used to put that in the spokes of my bike
[01:15:41.080 --> 01:15:42.000]  when I was a kid.
[01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:44.960]  I know, I'd be at the card shop,
[01:15:44.960 --> 01:15:47.560]  like trying to look up my shit on their back end.
[01:15:47.560 --> 01:15:48.960]  Like, did you buy that?
[01:15:48.960 --> 01:15:51.120]  Like, no dude, I'm just looking at my shit.
[01:15:51.120 --> 01:15:53.120]  Like stop grabbing up the Beckett.
[01:15:53.120 --> 01:15:55.680]  Fuck you, fuck you.
[01:15:56.560 --> 01:15:58.600]  You know, we need to get a seed catalog.
[01:15:58.600 --> 01:16:00.840]  Yeah, we need to get a Beckett of seeds.
[01:16:00.840 --> 01:16:03.040]  Like these right here.
[01:16:03.040 --> 01:16:07.040]  These are gonna be like banging off of your Beckett list.
[01:16:07.040 --> 01:16:09.480]  Those are THC or CBD in them?
[01:16:09.480 --> 01:16:11.160]  Like in the soap?
[01:16:11.160 --> 01:16:12.240]  Those are soap, right?
[01:16:12.240 --> 01:16:14.240]  No, these are actually from Bee Leaf Cannabis.
[01:16:14.240 --> 01:16:15.560]  Oh, that's Bee Leaf, okay.
[01:16:15.560 --> 01:16:17.240]  Button ladder cannabis, yeah.
[01:16:17.240 --> 01:16:18.400]  You know what?
[01:16:18.400 --> 01:16:20.000]  Damn, them Bee Leaf shit's probably cost.
[01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:22.440]  Those are expensive, all them cuts he's got are.
[01:16:22.440 --> 01:16:24.120]  Yeah, so let's see here.
[01:16:24.120 --> 01:16:27.960]  We've got the White Burgundy,
[01:16:28.880 --> 01:16:30.920]  which is the Daily Grape number nine
[01:16:30.920 --> 01:16:33.320]  times the White Truffle.
[01:16:33.320 --> 01:16:35.400]  We got, what is this?
[01:16:35.400 --> 01:16:38.920]  The Divine Truffle, which is Divinity number 35
[01:16:38.920 --> 01:16:39.840]  times White Truffle.
[01:16:39.840 --> 01:16:43.600]  That was a collab with In-House Genetics that he did.
[01:16:43.600 --> 01:16:48.400]  And then this one is the Love Trunken Beer
[01:16:48.400 --> 01:16:50.200]  Renous Lossless.
[01:16:51.760 --> 01:16:53.560]  I think I was close.
[01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:58.080]  Daily Grape number nine times Dippin' Stix cut of sugar cane,
[01:16:58.080 --> 01:17:01.680]  which the Dippin' Stix is super like candy.
[01:17:01.680 --> 01:17:03.040]  I mean, it is like it sounds.
[01:17:03.040 --> 01:17:05.880]  So these, you know, if there was a Beckett,
[01:17:05.880 --> 01:17:09.920]  these would probably be in the upper price category.
[01:17:09.920 --> 01:17:12.200]  So I'm running the Kool-Aid Man.
[01:17:12.200 --> 01:17:13.640]  Yeah, yeah, how's that?
[01:17:13.640 --> 01:17:14.480]  How is that?
[01:17:14.480 --> 01:17:15.320]  Fire?
[01:17:15.320 --> 01:17:16.440]  Dude, let's see here.
[01:17:16.440 --> 01:17:19.560]  The Kool-Aid Man, this is the Kool-Aid Man.
[01:17:19.560 --> 01:17:22.160]  So one of the frostier plants
[01:17:22.200 --> 01:17:23.600]  that I fricking have ever grown.
[01:17:23.600 --> 01:17:24.440]  That's a wasp.
[01:17:24.440 --> 01:17:25.280]  I can tell right now.
[01:17:25.280 --> 01:17:26.640]  It looks like a wasp.
[01:17:26.640 --> 01:17:27.480]  Look at that.
[01:17:27.480 --> 01:17:28.320]  I mean, even the just-
[01:17:28.320 --> 01:17:29.160]  That's strike real.
[01:17:29.160 --> 01:17:30.400]  Dude, the fan leaves.
[01:17:30.400 --> 01:17:34.040]  Yeah, so this was the Kool-Aid Man.
[01:17:34.040 --> 01:17:34.880]  That one's a keeper.
[01:17:34.880 --> 01:17:35.720]  That looks fire.
[01:17:35.720 --> 01:17:36.560]  What's it taste like?
[01:17:36.560 --> 01:17:37.400]  Fruity?
[01:17:37.400 --> 01:17:38.240]  Was it gassy fruity?
[01:17:38.240 --> 01:17:39.120]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:17:39.120 --> 01:17:39.960]  It's got orange.
[01:17:39.960 --> 01:17:44.120]  So it's like, I call it the Orange Chicken Pheno,
[01:17:44.120 --> 01:17:46.160]  which would probably just be like the OC Pheno,
[01:17:46.160 --> 01:17:47.600]  but it smells.
[01:17:47.600 --> 01:17:49.280]  So I had, I grew a couple of them.
[01:17:49.280 --> 01:17:50.880]  One was just straight orange,
[01:17:51.320 --> 01:17:55.440]  really strong, pleasant orange, wake you up.
[01:17:55.440 --> 01:17:59.600]  It was good, but it wasn't completely unique.
[01:17:59.600 --> 01:18:02.680]  The one that I did keep, it's a little bit different.
[01:18:02.680 --> 01:18:03.640]  It's weird, man.
[01:18:03.640 --> 01:18:05.880]  I tell you, you crack open a can
[01:18:05.880 --> 01:18:08.360]  of Campbell's Chicken Noodle Soup,
[01:18:08.360 --> 01:18:11.280]  and there's that kind of chicken noodle soup smell.
[01:18:11.280 --> 01:18:13.640]  That's how it smells on the plant.
[01:18:14.680 --> 01:18:18.720]  And kind of smells the buds, even with their dry.
[01:18:18.720 --> 01:18:23.320]  But then as it cures, that orange side just comes out.
[01:18:23.320 --> 01:18:24.560]  Like it's like a sherbet.
[01:18:24.560 --> 01:18:28.840]  Like it's a deep, like rich orange taste,
[01:18:28.840 --> 01:18:32.240]  not a creamsicle, not an actual like fruit orange,
[01:18:32.240 --> 01:18:35.640]  but just a like rich orangey taste.
[01:18:35.640 --> 01:18:36.800]  I almost want to say it's like,
[01:18:36.800 --> 01:18:39.360]  you know those like chocolate orange slices?
[01:18:39.360 --> 01:18:40.200]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:18:40.200 --> 01:18:41.760]  Yeah, kind of like that.
[01:18:43.200 --> 01:18:44.560]  And that's the flavor.
[01:18:44.560 --> 01:18:46.760]  It's, dude, it's a hitter for sure.
[01:18:46.760 --> 01:18:48.240]  I haven't washed it yet.
[01:18:49.160 --> 01:18:51.840]  Because I don't do that, but I probably,
[01:18:51.840 --> 01:18:53.960]  there are a couple of things that I want to get washed,
[01:18:53.960 --> 01:18:56.880]  just so I can know what the returns are on them.
[01:18:57.920 --> 01:18:59.960]  But yeah, dude, that one's a keeper.
[01:18:59.960 --> 01:19:02.240]  And again, the Kool-Aid man was the Bee Leaf Cannabis,
[01:19:02.240 --> 01:19:06.320]  but these will be into the rotation soon enough.
[01:19:06.320 --> 01:19:09.000]  Cause I'm loving the Bee Leaf.
[01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:10.760]  I don't got the Bee Leaf.
[01:19:10.760 --> 01:19:15.760]  My cross that I did, I mean, I didn't release it.
[01:19:15.920 --> 01:19:16.840]  I passed them all out.
[01:19:16.840 --> 01:19:19.360]  I had like 40 packs or 35 packs.
[01:19:20.320 --> 01:19:21.880]  The skunk bow is what I call it.
[01:19:21.880 --> 01:19:24.080]  It's the G13 skunk.
[01:19:26.360 --> 01:19:27.840]  From that.
[01:19:27.840 --> 01:19:29.320]  And I put that onto my Rambo Breath,
[01:19:29.320 --> 01:19:30.520]  which we talked about earlier.
[01:19:30.520 --> 01:19:35.360]  And that is super orange, orange and cream kind of,
[01:19:35.360 --> 01:19:37.720]  you know, orange and cream, super frosty.
[01:19:37.720 --> 01:19:40.400]  If you look back a little while on my IG,
[01:19:40.400 --> 01:19:43.280]  but some other folks are finally running it when I,
[01:19:44.080 --> 01:19:46.840]  it takes a while to pass the seeds out
[01:19:47.740 --> 01:19:51.320]  and then show people the weed and then get them to grow it.
[01:19:51.320 --> 01:19:54.400]  So by the time that's all said and done, but yeah.
[01:19:54.400 --> 01:19:58.760]  And there's none available, but it's really good stuff.
[01:19:58.760 --> 01:20:02.040]  I got a couple of lights of that going right now.
[01:20:02.040 --> 01:20:05.480]  So I'm excited to have some more flower of that.
[01:20:05.480 --> 01:20:08.840]  But yeah, that's my orange, orange cream thing.
[01:20:08.840 --> 01:20:11.440]  And I believe it's that G13 skunk, which is.
[01:20:14.040 --> 01:20:14.880]  I would guess.
[01:20:14.880 --> 01:20:15.920]  It's phenomenal.
[01:20:15.920 --> 01:20:18.040]  That's a Duke Diamond exclusive.
[01:20:18.040 --> 01:20:19.880]  Yeah, a couple of things here.
[01:20:19.880 --> 01:20:23.840]  Rufus, that word he's saying is German,
[01:20:23.840 --> 01:20:26.520]  which I absolutely believe.
[01:20:26.520 --> 01:20:27.360]  So thanks.
[01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:30.560]  I'm like, yeah, that makes sense.
[01:20:30.560 --> 01:20:32.240]  I'm gonna roll with it.
[01:20:32.240 --> 01:20:37.240]  And then Mr. Magpie here and Sativa Smurf as well,
[01:20:37.760 --> 01:20:39.760]  giving me some helpful pointers here.
[01:20:39.760 --> 01:20:41.320]  Just kind of how I can get a little bit
[01:20:41.320 --> 01:20:42.840]  of a test wash myself.
[01:20:43.920 --> 01:20:46.720]  I do make bubble with all of my trim.
[01:20:48.840 --> 01:20:52.680]  And I guess, yeah, I guess everybody gets their,
[01:20:52.680 --> 01:20:56.680]  like their wash or their hash resin, their heads,
[01:20:56.680 --> 01:20:58.280]  and then they press it.
[01:20:58.280 --> 01:21:00.380]  And then that's what they judge the returns off of
[01:21:00.380 --> 01:21:01.680]  where I'm typically.
[01:21:01.680 --> 01:21:02.920]  Like, could people, I don't know,
[01:21:02.920 --> 01:21:05.400]  do people just press straight up flower anymore?
[01:21:05.400 --> 01:21:07.200]  Because that's what I was thinking in my head
[01:21:07.200 --> 01:21:09.680]  when I'm like, oh, I need to get a test on my return.
[01:21:09.680 --> 01:21:12.400]  I'd press the flower and see.
[01:21:13.040 --> 01:21:17.600]  What I do is I chop my shit up,
[01:21:18.520 --> 01:21:19.640]  you know what I'm saying?
[01:21:19.640 --> 01:21:21.240]  Freeze it, and then I give it to,
[01:21:21.240 --> 01:21:23.040]  shout out to Terp Wizard.
[01:21:23.040 --> 01:21:24.080]  He does the rest.
[01:21:26.040 --> 01:21:29.480]  I mean, I make VHL, so I know people,
[01:21:29.480 --> 01:21:31.600]  but I use trim for the VHL.
[01:21:31.600 --> 01:21:34.200]  And then I take it out of the fridge
[01:21:34.200 --> 01:21:36.120]  and then I walk to my car,
[01:21:36.120 --> 01:21:38.080]  but I got to open the garage door.
[01:21:38.080 --> 01:21:39.440]  I want to throw this up real quick.
[01:21:39.440 --> 01:21:40.280]  Boom.
[01:21:42.440 --> 01:21:44.400]  Shout out to Kazoo.
[01:21:44.400 --> 01:21:46.720]  That's my go-to guy.
[01:21:46.720 --> 01:21:48.600]  He designed this for me.
[01:21:48.600 --> 01:21:53.240]  We may have been partaking in some fun times
[01:21:53.240 --> 01:21:55.600]  at the bachelor party when we kind of-
[01:21:55.600 --> 01:21:56.760]  Nice.
[01:21:56.760 --> 01:21:59.160]  Decided that would be a good idea.
[01:21:59.160 --> 01:22:01.760]  I'm gonna go with my Kazoo masterpiece right here.
[01:22:01.760 --> 01:22:02.600]  Oh, hell yeah.
[01:22:02.600 --> 01:22:03.440]  There you go.
[01:22:03.440 --> 01:22:04.280]  Fuck yeah, baby.
[01:22:04.280 --> 01:22:05.840]  Yeah, baby.
[01:22:05.840 --> 01:22:06.680]  That's my homie too.
[01:22:06.680 --> 01:22:08.360]  Kazoo's the homie.
[01:22:08.360 --> 01:22:09.200]  Here too.
[01:22:09.200 --> 01:22:10.920]  He did this one as well.
[01:22:10.920 --> 01:22:13.520]  But I did just get to slap.
[01:22:13.520 --> 01:22:14.920]  That's the older one.
[01:22:14.920 --> 01:22:17.560]  That's Tommy Montana, man.
[01:22:17.560 --> 01:22:18.400]  Hey, man.
[01:22:18.400 --> 01:22:19.240]  That's awesome.
[01:22:19.240 --> 01:22:22.800]  You're talking to the bad guy.
[01:22:22.800 --> 01:22:25.200]  You'll never see a bad guy like this again, man.
[01:22:26.920 --> 01:22:28.800]  I've actually seen a few Instagram posts
[01:22:28.800 --> 01:22:31.320]  and I don't know if it was you or Kazoo or somebody else,
[01:22:31.320 --> 01:22:33.160]  but I've seen those out in the wild,
[01:22:33.160 --> 01:22:34.680]  like on phone booth type stuff.
[01:22:34.680 --> 01:22:35.520]  What?
[01:22:35.520 --> 01:22:36.360]  Fuck yeah.
[01:22:36.360 --> 01:22:37.200]  Yeah, we were doing that for a while.
[01:22:37.200 --> 01:22:40.040]  It was like, yeah, there's a bunch in Chicago.
[01:22:40.240 --> 01:22:41.760]  And that's my dad's art.
[01:22:41.760 --> 01:22:42.680]  My dad did that one.
[01:22:42.680 --> 01:22:43.960]  So that's Rambo.
[01:22:43.960 --> 01:22:45.000]  That's awesome.
[01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:46.880]  Obviously, you know.
[01:22:46.880 --> 01:22:48.960]  I thought that was for your Rambo breath for a second.
[01:22:48.960 --> 01:22:49.800]  Well, yeah, no, it is.
[01:22:49.800 --> 01:22:52.360]  But I'm saying my dad did this for me.
[01:22:53.440 --> 01:22:57.080]  He's putting like a puddle of concentrate.
[01:22:57.080 --> 01:23:00.000]  He's got the bong under his arm like a thing.
[01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:00.840]  He knows what's up.
[01:23:00.840 --> 01:23:03.920]  Notice the bayonet or the, what's it called?
[01:23:03.920 --> 01:23:08.440]  A bandana or whatever with the, it's all spliffs in there.
[01:23:09.280 --> 01:23:11.000]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:12.760]  Rest in peace, pops.
[01:23:12.760 --> 01:23:16.960]  No, no, I got some, I actually made a couple,
[01:23:16.960 --> 01:23:19.560]  I did not like production, but I made a,
[01:23:20.520 --> 01:23:23.880]  I got a hoodie with the Scarface logo on it
[01:23:23.880 --> 01:23:25.680]  and a couple of t-shirts that came out pretty good.
[01:23:25.680 --> 01:23:29.240]  So I'm just dipping my finger into that.
[01:23:29.240 --> 01:23:30.080]  Yeah.
[01:23:30.080 --> 01:23:31.400]  Making my own shirts and shit.
[01:23:31.400 --> 01:23:32.240]  You know what I'm saying?
[01:23:32.240 --> 01:23:35.560]  Dude, I almost wore my own shirt on the show tonight.
[01:23:35.560 --> 01:23:37.840]  Like I was in the closet, I was gonna pull it out.
[01:23:38.280 --> 01:23:42.120]  And I'm like, nah, where's somebody else's?
[01:23:42.120 --> 01:23:44.720]  Cause so the first time it was Duke Diamonds
[01:23:44.720 --> 01:23:47.800]  cause I've been bugging that dude for merch forever.
[01:23:47.800 --> 01:23:49.400]  And he finally released some merch.
[01:23:49.400 --> 01:23:51.200]  So I'm like, I better fucking buy it.
[01:23:51.200 --> 01:23:52.560]  I've been in his ear the whole time.
[01:23:52.560 --> 01:23:53.400]  So.
[01:23:53.400 --> 01:23:54.240]  Those hoodies are nice.
[01:23:54.240 --> 01:23:55.280]  I got a hoodie and a t-shirt.
[01:23:55.280 --> 01:23:57.440]  But yeah, those hoodies are fucking nice, dude.
[01:23:57.440 --> 01:24:01.000]  The quality on the zipper and just, you know what I'm saying?
[01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:02.200]  It's a zippy hoodie.
[01:24:02.200 --> 01:24:05.880]  And when you buy, when you spend money on a hoodie,
[01:24:06.880 --> 01:24:11.880]  I mean, at least at like my size, I'm like a large,
[01:24:12.400 --> 01:24:13.240]  but you know what I mean?
[01:24:13.240 --> 01:24:14.960]  Sometimes like a large is either too big
[01:24:14.960 --> 01:24:16.160]  or then you shrink the large.
[01:24:16.160 --> 01:24:17.000]  You know what I mean?
[01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:19.200]  Like I don't like worrying about shrinking my clothes.
[01:24:19.200 --> 01:24:22.360]  It's like, especially if you're ordering in the mail,
[01:24:22.360 --> 01:24:23.400]  you kind of kind of wonder,
[01:24:23.400 --> 01:24:25.520]  like I just hope it fits when it's all said and done.
[01:24:25.520 --> 01:24:26.360]  You know what I mean?
[01:24:26.360 --> 01:24:27.800]  Shout out to Seattle Chronic though.
[01:24:27.800 --> 01:24:29.320]  This one is getting old.
[01:24:29.320 --> 01:24:30.160]  Boom.
[01:24:30.160 --> 01:24:32.880]  My Seattle Chronic hat is just, it's like all tacked.
[01:24:36.760 --> 01:24:38.240]  Yeah. Shout out to the gear.
[01:24:38.240 --> 01:24:40.600]  Sometimes I like the gear more than the...
[01:24:40.600 --> 01:24:41.440]  I'm just...
[01:24:41.440 --> 01:24:45.440]  So the second shirt I wore was actually speaking of Kazoo,
[01:24:45.440 --> 01:24:46.840]  was made by Kazoo.
[01:24:46.840 --> 01:24:47.960]  It was the last episode,
[01:24:47.960 --> 01:24:51.960]  but it was a new Weed Nerds World design.
[01:24:51.960 --> 01:24:55.160]  So the Weed Nerd World was originally a sub-cool
[01:24:55.160 --> 01:24:57.680]  of TGA and the Danks.
[01:24:57.680 --> 01:25:00.320]  You know, he built a community.
[01:25:00.320 --> 01:25:02.960]  And one of those members that came to it was Eagle Gardens.
[01:25:02.960 --> 01:25:05.120]  And you know, with the blessing of some people,
[01:25:05.160 --> 01:25:08.160]  he was able to continue the Weed Nerd World.
[01:25:08.160 --> 01:25:09.240]  So he's doing that.
[01:25:09.240 --> 01:25:12.520]  But you mentioned Seattle Chronic.
[01:25:12.520 --> 01:25:15.440]  I only have one thing here on that guy.
[01:25:15.440 --> 01:25:16.440]  I did it upside down.
[01:25:16.440 --> 01:25:20.560]  I got the slap, but I've got the Boz, which is awesome.
[01:25:20.560 --> 01:25:24.020]  It's a Brian Bosworth reference for you football fans.
[01:25:24.020 --> 01:25:27.160]  But that has the Melvins times the Bickett OG.
[01:25:27.160 --> 01:25:28.000]  And Bick...
[01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:31.520]  Now, so is Bickett something that Nick really likes
[01:25:31.520 --> 01:25:34.040]  or was Bickett something that came from Nick Risen,
[01:25:34.040 --> 01:25:35.320]  Lime Rising Carbs?
[01:25:35.320 --> 01:25:37.360]  Yeah, no, it came from Nick.
[01:25:37.360 --> 01:25:38.200]  Okay.
[01:25:38.200 --> 01:25:41.600]  That is a Cherry Pie times GMO.
[01:25:41.600 --> 01:25:42.440]  Oh.
[01:25:42.440 --> 01:25:44.680]  And I believe the Cherry Pie,
[01:25:46.360 --> 01:25:48.200]  I believe the Cherry Pie hermed out.
[01:25:48.200 --> 01:25:50.840]  And that's how the actual seed was.
[01:25:50.840 --> 01:25:53.680]  He never released the Bickett OG seed.
[01:25:53.680 --> 01:25:55.160]  So that's cut.
[01:25:55.160 --> 01:25:56.800]  I was the first person to actually,
[01:25:56.800 --> 01:25:58.640]  that's when I, the first time I ever met Nick
[01:25:58.640 --> 01:26:00.880]  is I got the cut off of him, right?
[01:26:00.920 --> 01:26:04.960]  I was like, whatever, three or four years ago.
[01:26:04.960 --> 01:26:06.560]  Wow.
[01:26:06.560 --> 01:26:08.360]  Yeah, so that, I mean, at Bickett's fire,
[01:26:08.360 --> 01:26:10.400]  but if you're not into tall shit
[01:26:10.400 --> 01:26:13.600]  that takes 11 and a half weeks, you know what I mean?
[01:26:13.600 --> 01:26:14.440]  Right.
[01:26:14.440 --> 01:26:16.400]  It's a lot like the GMO.
[01:26:17.480 --> 01:26:18.640]  It's not like the Cherry Pie.
[01:26:18.640 --> 01:26:20.340]  It's more like the GMO, so.
[01:26:21.280 --> 01:26:22.920]  And that's what I'm thinking.
[01:26:22.920 --> 01:26:24.680]  Really good herb, really good washer,
[01:26:24.680 --> 01:26:27.440]  but it's tall as fuck.
[01:26:27.440 --> 01:26:30.320]  I mean, I don't have it anymore.
[01:26:30.720 --> 01:26:32.640]  I made some crosses with it.
[01:26:32.640 --> 01:26:34.400]  I got the seed stocked up, you know what I'm saying?
[01:26:34.400 --> 01:26:35.240]  Yeah, right.
[01:26:35.240 --> 01:26:37.400]  But there was some shit that was just like,
[01:26:38.760 --> 01:26:41.960]  I mean, yeah, honestly, if you're growing in a tent,
[01:26:41.960 --> 01:26:43.580]  it's hard to even do.
[01:26:44.760 --> 01:26:46.960]  I got 10 foot plus,
[01:26:46.960 --> 01:26:49.000]  I think I got 12 foot seedlings here in my garage
[01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:49.840]  where I grow.
[01:26:51.120 --> 01:26:52.760]  If you're maxing out in there, bro,
[01:26:52.760 --> 01:26:54.280]  yeah, it's not fitting in my six foot tent.
[01:26:54.280 --> 01:26:55.920]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:26:55.920 --> 01:26:58.600]  I mean, it's always in the light.
[01:26:58.600 --> 01:27:00.640]  It's just one of those ones you gotta just,
[01:27:01.480 --> 01:27:03.640]  you know, it's like, oh shit.
[01:27:03.640 --> 01:27:05.560]  Like it just gets out of control.
[01:27:05.560 --> 01:27:10.560]  You gotta be really, really into bending your branches down
[01:27:10.680 --> 01:27:12.520]  and fucking keeping on it every day.
[01:27:12.520 --> 01:27:14.960]  Yeah, I've had a, I'm not quite sure.
[01:27:14.960 --> 01:27:16.840]  This plant's like beautiful outdoor though.
[01:27:16.840 --> 01:27:17.680]  Oh, hey, this is the-
[01:27:17.680 --> 01:27:19.520]  Still cooling down.
[01:27:19.520 --> 01:27:21.880]  That's the Kool-Aid box, I guess I-
[01:27:21.880 --> 01:27:22.720]  Right, right.
[01:27:22.720 --> 01:27:23.540]  That's what I was gonna ask.
[01:27:23.540 --> 01:27:25.880]  So you didn't buy the cut for-
[01:27:25.880 --> 01:27:27.400]  No.
[01:27:27.400 --> 01:27:30.320]  No, no, this was actually, he gifted this to me.
[01:27:31.160 --> 01:27:34.480]  He was on the Brian and Marco show.
[01:27:34.480 --> 01:27:38.000]  So watermelon mimosa number 10 times the creature.
[01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:40.900]  And after the show, he just kind of individually
[01:27:40.900 --> 01:27:41.740]  hit us all up.
[01:27:41.740 --> 01:27:44.320]  He's like, hey, Rasta, what's your address?
[01:27:44.320 --> 01:27:46.760]  And a couple of weeks later, T-shirt,
[01:27:46.760 --> 01:27:49.160]  some beans and some slaps showed up.
[01:27:49.160 --> 01:27:51.440]  I was like, fuck man, you didn't have to do that.
[01:27:51.440 --> 01:27:52.880]  That was very nice of you.
[01:27:52.880 --> 01:27:55.800]  And then I grew them out and I was like, really?
[01:27:56.800 --> 01:27:57.640]  Thank you.
[01:27:57.640 --> 01:27:59.120]  Now I might have to do the same thing.
[01:27:59.120 --> 01:28:02.520]  I'm gonna have to bust the whole FCP through
[01:28:02.520 --> 01:28:05.520]  with some beans.
[01:28:05.520 --> 01:28:06.360]  Let's do this.
[01:28:06.360 --> 01:28:07.920]  Can someone, let's name a breed,
[01:28:07.920 --> 01:28:10.160]  like look in chat, can someone name a breeder
[01:28:10.160 --> 01:28:11.680]  and we'll see what we can pull out?
[01:28:11.680 --> 01:28:13.120]  Yeah, that's a fun game.
[01:28:13.120 --> 01:28:16.200]  Somebody names some strains or somebody name a breeder
[01:28:16.200 --> 01:28:18.400]  and we'll see how close we can get to it.
[01:28:18.400 --> 01:28:20.920]  I do wanna pause the action real quick
[01:28:21.880 --> 01:28:26.880]  to kind of like, I don't know, it's a little bit weird
[01:28:27.560 --> 01:28:30.920]  because I'm not the person to tell anybody
[01:28:30.920 --> 01:28:32.760]  what to do with their money.
[01:28:32.760 --> 01:28:35.320]  But I just wanna share something that I do
[01:28:35.320 --> 01:28:36.200]  or I try to do.
[01:28:36.200 --> 01:28:38.960]  Again, like guys, this is a little bit weird for me,
[01:28:38.960 --> 01:28:40.680]  but there's a lot of people in this community
[01:28:40.680 --> 01:28:42.760]  who can use help.
[01:28:42.760 --> 01:28:44.240]  That's kind of one of the fortunate,
[01:28:44.240 --> 01:28:48.560]  unfortunate things about cannabis and helping people
[01:28:48.600 --> 01:28:51.000]  is you meet a lot of people that need help.
[01:28:53.560 --> 01:28:55.840]  So seed collectors, in particular too,
[01:28:55.840 --> 01:28:58.360]  usually we've got a little bit more expendable income,
[01:28:58.360 --> 01:29:00.940]  but I've lived on $2 a day, slept in my van
[01:29:00.940 --> 01:29:01.920]  for months at a time.
[01:29:01.920 --> 01:29:04.480]  So this doesn't apply to everybody
[01:29:04.480 --> 01:29:05.900]  and I'm not telling you what to do with your money,
[01:29:05.900 --> 01:29:10.900]  but I just wanna say the power of one goes a long way
[01:29:11.320 --> 01:29:12.520]  and as a collective.
[01:29:12.520 --> 01:29:14.520]  So I'm just rambling here.
[01:29:14.520 --> 01:29:17.280]  What I'm trying to say is basically like,
[01:29:17.280 --> 01:29:20.760]  sometimes if you're getting a whole bunch of packs of seeds
[01:29:20.760 --> 01:29:22.760]  or you're drinking a Starbucks every day,
[01:29:22.760 --> 01:29:26.520]  maybe set aside like $10 or $15 a month
[01:29:26.520 --> 01:29:29.120]  that you can put towards something that you believe in,
[01:29:29.120 --> 01:29:31.720]  whether it's like an animal shelter,
[01:29:31.720 --> 01:29:34.240]  whether it's like helping inner city children,
[01:29:34.240 --> 01:29:37.920]  whether it's helping like feed people, whatever it is.
[01:29:37.920 --> 01:29:41.520]  Like even, I'm just a fan of just like even $10,
[01:29:41.520 --> 01:29:44.140]  $10 sounds so insignificant,
[01:29:44.180 --> 01:29:49.180]  but if everybody in chat or whatever,
[01:29:49.300 --> 01:29:51.660]  and again, I'm not telling anybody to do anything,
[01:29:51.660 --> 01:29:54.580]  but if everybody just gave like $1,
[01:29:54.580 --> 01:29:56.440]  I've seen these things add up for things.
[01:29:56.440 --> 01:29:59.300]  So there are things that if you believe in them,
[01:29:59.300 --> 01:30:03.140]  skip that cup of coffee, throw it down.
[01:30:03.140 --> 01:30:05.900]  There's actually, and I put a couple of GoFundMes,
[01:30:05.900 --> 01:30:09.900]  actually these aren't people that I'm really related to,
[01:30:09.900 --> 01:30:11.980]  a couple of people, well, I'm not related to at all,
[01:30:11.980 --> 01:30:13.440]  never met them in my life.
[01:30:14.260 --> 01:30:15.980]  Couple of people that watch the shows
[01:30:15.980 --> 01:30:18.860]  and support the channel a lot, they have GoFundMes,
[01:30:19.820 --> 01:30:21.240]  and you can look into that if you want.
[01:30:21.240 --> 01:30:23.500]  The links are down in the show description,
[01:30:23.500 --> 01:30:26.620]  but again, just if people like throw $1 at something
[01:30:26.620 --> 01:30:29.340]  that they believe in or they're passionate about,
[01:30:29.340 --> 01:30:31.900]  hopefully we can get a lot of greater things done
[01:30:31.900 --> 01:30:32.740]  in this world.
[01:30:32.740 --> 01:30:35.100]  It's like, again, $1 doesn't sound like much,
[01:30:35.100 --> 01:30:39.220]  but if you just take $10 every month, then, all right.
[01:30:39.220 --> 01:30:42.220]  So there are some GoFundMe links in there.
[01:30:42.220 --> 01:30:44.420]  Also guys, I encourage you to find your own
[01:30:44.420 --> 01:30:46.940]  and thank you for letting me get out there.
[01:30:46.940 --> 01:30:48.880]  Sorry for the awkward pause,
[01:30:50.220 --> 01:30:53.300]  sometimes you gotta use a platform that you have
[01:30:53.300 --> 01:30:55.460]  to encourage betterment.
[01:30:55.460 --> 01:30:56.900]  So I wanna mention those.
[01:30:56.900 --> 01:30:58.620]  So yeah, check those out if you'd like,
[01:30:58.620 --> 01:31:00.020]  check your own out.
[01:31:00.020 --> 01:31:01.700]  On with the show.
[01:31:01.700 --> 01:31:02.540]  That was awkward.
[01:31:02.540 --> 01:31:03.900]  There's a platform at all, I agree 100%.
[01:31:03.900 --> 01:31:05.820]  There we go, pay it forward.
[01:31:05.820 --> 01:31:09.000]  I mean, even if it's not a financial thing,
[01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:11.220]  if there's something you can do to help somebody out,
[01:31:11.220 --> 01:31:13.860]  help your fellow human being, do it, man.
[01:31:13.860 --> 01:31:15.300]  You know what I mean?
[01:31:15.300 --> 01:31:16.740]  Life ain't that long, man.
[01:31:16.740 --> 01:31:18.500]  You never know what tomorrow brings.
[01:31:18.500 --> 01:31:21.420]  So I agree 100%, man.
[01:31:21.420 --> 01:31:24.060]  Especially if you're in a position to help somebody out.
[01:31:24.060 --> 01:31:25.900]  And I know how it is to be struggling
[01:31:25.900 --> 01:31:28.740]  and I know how it is to be basically out in the streets,
[01:31:28.740 --> 01:31:30.780]  running from the fucking federal government
[01:31:30.780 --> 01:31:32.100]  and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[01:31:32.100 --> 01:31:33.180]  And let's just put it like-
[01:31:33.180 --> 01:31:34.140]  It's expensive.
[01:31:34.140 --> 01:31:36.660]  Yeah, yeah, times are good, times are bad.
[01:31:36.660 --> 01:31:37.500]  You know what I'm saying?
[01:31:37.500 --> 01:31:39.100]  Just go with the flow and yeah,
[01:31:39.100 --> 01:31:42.580]  if you got the means and help somebody out, you know.
[01:31:42.580 --> 01:31:43.900]  Yeah, well, that's cool, man.
[01:31:43.900 --> 01:31:45.060]  And I like the way you framed it.
[01:31:45.060 --> 01:31:47.340]  I probably could have just like got through
[01:31:47.340 --> 01:31:48.740]  that awkwardness with just saying,
[01:31:48.740 --> 01:31:50.340]  pay it forward and Kazoo coming in.
[01:31:50.340 --> 01:31:51.980]  Yeah, pay it forward if you can.
[01:31:51.980 --> 01:31:53.060]  And again, he's a great guy.
[01:31:53.060 --> 01:31:54.460]  Here's a good example.
[01:31:54.460 --> 01:31:57.780]  Kazoo has gifted me with an incredible amount of seeds
[01:31:57.780 --> 01:32:00.260]  and I am eternally thankful for those.
[01:32:00.260 --> 01:32:02.060]  And I get to grow those.
[01:32:02.060 --> 01:32:04.140]  He also gave me so many that I'm like,
[01:32:04.140 --> 01:32:07.860]  I knew I could never grow every single one of those out.
[01:32:07.860 --> 01:32:10.020]  So a little while ago, what did we do?
[01:32:10.020 --> 01:32:11.860]  There were people in needs of beans.
[01:32:11.860 --> 01:32:13.100]  And I said, hey, you know what?
[01:32:13.100 --> 01:32:13.940]  I've got some.
[01:32:13.940 --> 01:32:14.760]  I reached out, I said,
[01:32:14.760 --> 01:32:17.580]  Kazoo, do you mind if I re-gift these to some people?
[01:32:17.580 --> 01:32:19.260]  And he's like, why do you even ask?
[01:32:19.260 --> 01:32:21.580]  Of course, dude, get them out there.
[01:32:21.580 --> 01:32:23.820]  So yeah, those little things help
[01:32:23.820 --> 01:32:25.300]  and that's just kind of paying it forward.
[01:32:25.300 --> 01:32:27.140]  So word up.
[01:32:27.140 --> 01:32:28.420]  For sure, 100, 100.
[01:32:28.420 --> 01:32:31.100]  Kazoo is a true gentleman.
[01:32:31.100 --> 01:32:32.340]  Much love to the homie.
[01:32:32.340 --> 01:32:33.500]  That's the homie.
[01:32:33.500 --> 01:32:34.500]  Yep, yep.
[01:32:34.500 --> 01:32:37.100]  So we'll get to the seeds.
[01:32:37.100 --> 01:32:39.220]  Yep, so, all right.
[01:32:39.220 --> 01:32:40.540]  What do we got next?
[01:32:40.540 --> 01:32:42.220]  Are you digging through another bag?
[01:32:42.220 --> 01:32:43.180]  Are you going through?
[01:32:43.180 --> 01:32:44.500]  No one has a request?
[01:32:44.500 --> 01:32:46.700]  I don't know what to go for.
[01:32:46.700 --> 01:32:48.140]  Dave is good at this.
[01:32:48.140 --> 01:32:49.460]  All right, you wanna see this?
[01:32:49.460 --> 01:32:50.300]  Let's see.
[01:32:50.300 --> 01:32:51.820]  I'm looking for a cult classic.
[01:32:51.820 --> 01:32:54.980]  So do we have anything that's like a cult classic?
[01:32:54.980 --> 01:32:56.980]  Okay, some real classic.
[01:32:56.980 --> 01:32:59.620]  I'll go, and again, I haven't popped these yet,
[01:32:59.620 --> 01:33:04.620]  so we'll see, but Cheese Exodus, aka Exodus Cheese.
[01:33:04.620 --> 01:33:07.540]  That's another sample from a European seed bank.
[01:33:07.540 --> 01:33:11.620]  This was from, oh, I can't see here.
[01:33:11.620 --> 01:33:12.460]  There we go.
[01:33:12.460 --> 01:33:14.740]  So skunk number one times Afghani.
[01:33:14.740 --> 01:33:19.060]  That definitely would hit you in the cult classic territory.
[01:33:19.060 --> 01:33:20.940]  And I really hope it has that cheese flavor
[01:33:20.940 --> 01:33:22.340]  because man, am I looking for it.
[01:33:22.340 --> 01:33:24.020]  Okay, so that was Garden of Greens
[01:33:24.020 --> 01:33:25.260]  that I got that one from.
[01:33:25.260 --> 01:33:27.900]  That's kind of on the cult classic tip.
[01:33:27.900 --> 01:33:28.740]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:33:28.740 --> 01:33:30.460]  I'm trying to, let me, give me a sec.
[01:33:30.460 --> 01:33:31.300]  Give me a sec.
[01:33:31.300 --> 01:33:32.620]  Let's see what I, hold on.
[01:33:32.620 --> 01:33:33.900]  I have a whole package back here.
[01:33:33.900 --> 01:33:34.740]  Another one.
[01:33:34.740 --> 01:33:36.860]  I got a whole bunch of samples for the cheese.
[01:33:36.860 --> 01:33:38.140]  So Royal Queen Seed.
[01:33:38.140 --> 01:33:41.540]  So another, so Blue Cheese, Blue Cheese there.
[01:33:41.540 --> 01:33:43.980]  Again, this is gonna be part of my cheese hunt.
[01:33:43.980 --> 01:33:46.060]  Oh, I'm so good with focusing.
[01:33:46.060 --> 01:33:46.900]  There you go.
[01:33:46.900 --> 01:33:48.220]  Are you looking for the skunky cheese
[01:33:48.220 --> 01:33:50.180]  or are you looking for the-
[01:33:50.180 --> 01:33:51.540]  Yeah.
[01:33:51.540 --> 01:33:53.460]  I think one of my cult classics
[01:33:53.460 --> 01:33:55.580]  might've been in that bundle.
[01:33:55.580 --> 01:33:57.260]  Oh, what do I have in there?
[01:33:57.260 --> 01:33:58.380]  Some haze.
[01:33:59.420 --> 01:34:01.820]  You had the hazes and you have all those skunks.
[01:34:01.860 --> 01:34:04.540]  I mean, I don't think you get any more
[01:34:04.540 --> 01:34:06.020]  classic than that.
[01:34:07.220 --> 01:34:11.700]  This one, I'm not so sure if it's necessarily cult classic
[01:34:11.700 --> 01:34:13.980]  but it's the Chiara Skunk,
[01:34:14.900 --> 01:34:18.700]  Chiara Kush times Uncle Fester Skunk.
[01:34:18.700 --> 01:34:23.420]  That is a seven least genetics is South Bay genetics
[01:34:23.420 --> 01:34:24.540]  but also Flora Nugs.
[01:34:24.540 --> 01:34:26.560]  He's a person that's around a lot here.
[01:34:27.460 --> 01:34:28.740]  He sent me this one.
[01:34:28.740 --> 01:34:30.260]  So that one I'm holding on to
[01:34:30.260 --> 01:34:32.780]  because that I definitely want to grow myself.
[01:34:32.780 --> 01:34:36.180]  Anything with the word skunk in it, I'm going for it.
[01:34:36.180 --> 01:34:37.300]  But I've given up on it
[01:34:37.300 --> 01:34:39.700]  and I'm kind of doing cheese right now.
[01:34:39.700 --> 01:34:41.660]  Because I got discouraged.
[01:34:41.660 --> 01:34:43.180]  When I get the real skunk,
[01:34:44.180 --> 01:34:46.180]  we'll send you one of those egg cartons, wink wink.
[01:34:46.180 --> 01:34:47.020]  You know what I'm saying?
[01:34:47.020 --> 01:34:47.940]  Yes, sir.
[01:34:47.940 --> 01:34:50.260]  I do love farm fresh butt nuggets, yes.
[01:34:50.260 --> 01:34:51.100]  Yeah.
[01:34:52.540 --> 01:34:54.220]  Free Thinkers Conservation.
[01:34:54.220 --> 01:34:57.700]  That is a good seed company here.
[01:34:57.700 --> 01:34:58.700]  Let's see here.
[01:34:59.700 --> 01:35:01.060]  I like this.
[01:35:01.060 --> 01:35:03.420]  Free Thinkers Conservation.
[01:35:03.420 --> 01:35:04.500]  Boom.
[01:35:04.500 --> 01:35:05.540]  Let's see what I've got here.
[01:35:05.540 --> 01:35:06.380]  And this was from Cam.
[01:35:06.380 --> 01:35:10.100]  He was a guest on this show as well.
[01:35:10.100 --> 01:35:13.460]  And he's done a few things for FCP
[01:35:13.460 --> 01:35:16.060]  and he's hopefully getting prepared to do some shows.
[01:35:16.060 --> 01:35:18.100]  But from him, let's see.
[01:35:18.100 --> 01:35:20.420]  We've got, and I grew a couple of the,
[01:35:20.420 --> 01:35:22.580]  which ones did I grow?
[01:35:22.580 --> 01:35:25.380]  The, where is it?
[01:35:26.380 --> 01:35:28.220]  Here's kind of one of the,
[01:35:30.020 --> 01:35:32.820]  this is Swayze times the Sage and Sour.
[01:35:32.820 --> 01:35:35.700]  That's kind of like a little bit older, right?
[01:35:35.700 --> 01:35:37.740]  I love, I love the, I love Swayze.
[01:35:37.740 --> 01:35:39.300]  Okay, Swayze, anything.
[01:35:39.300 --> 01:35:41.180]  That's, who's this?
[01:35:41.180 --> 01:35:43.660]  This is, what the fuck is his name?
[01:35:43.660 --> 01:35:44.740]  Adam Dunn, right?
[01:35:44.740 --> 01:35:47.580]  Yeah, THC, Sage and Sour, yep.
[01:35:47.580 --> 01:35:48.420]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:35:48.420 --> 01:35:49.260]  Okay.
[01:35:49.260 --> 01:35:50.100]  Grew that one.
[01:35:50.100 --> 01:35:51.500]  That was a good one.
[01:35:51.500 --> 01:35:52.340]  Definitely.
[01:35:52.340 --> 01:35:53.180]  Let's see here.
[01:35:53.420 --> 01:35:56.260]  Somebody throwing up Skunk VA.
[01:35:56.260 --> 01:35:58.820]  Again, this came from Fresh Feet.
[01:35:58.820 --> 01:36:01.020]  Another guest of this show,
[01:36:01.020 --> 01:36:03.380]  but this is the Twin Peaks,
[01:36:03.380 --> 01:36:05.580]  Lucky Dog Seed Co, Skunk VA,
[01:36:05.580 --> 01:36:08.740]  Cam 91 BX2 times Cam Sis.
[01:36:08.740 --> 01:36:09.940]  Again, he was listening.
[01:36:09.940 --> 01:36:12.820]  He heard that I love the Cam 91.
[01:36:12.820 --> 01:36:14.540]  He's like, I'm a seed collector.
[01:36:14.540 --> 01:36:15.940]  I think these belong to you.
[01:36:16.980 --> 01:36:17.820]  Thank you, brother.
[01:36:17.820 --> 01:36:18.660]  NL number five.
[01:36:18.660 --> 01:36:20.340]  Oh, let me pop you up.
[01:36:20.340 --> 01:36:21.500]  Damn.
[01:36:21.620 --> 01:36:23.660]  NL number five from Ital.
[01:36:23.660 --> 01:36:25.220]  Wow, okay.
[01:36:25.220 --> 01:36:28.300]  Ital Foundation in the old school.
[01:36:28.300 --> 01:36:30.580]  It's kind of like a mini cigar tube that come in.
[01:36:30.580 --> 01:36:32.060]  Yeah, that's dope, man.
[01:36:32.060 --> 01:36:33.300]  I like that packaging.
[01:36:35.140 --> 01:36:35.980]  Let's see here.
[01:36:38.060 --> 01:36:39.780]  Joel grows those monster plants.
[01:36:39.780 --> 01:36:41.980]  He's Mr. 12 pound plant or whatever the fuck
[01:36:41.980 --> 01:36:43.660]  over there in North Carolina.
[01:36:43.660 --> 01:36:45.820]  We're getting some good suggestions in here.
[01:36:45.820 --> 01:36:48.100]  I don't have any.
[01:36:48.100 --> 01:36:50.500]  So we got Grape Ape.
[01:36:50.500 --> 01:36:52.860]  I don't have Grape Ape.
[01:36:52.860 --> 01:36:54.340]  Grape Ape I don't have.
[01:36:54.340 --> 01:36:55.180]  How about these ones?
[01:36:55.180 --> 01:36:58.100]  These are, this is-
[01:36:58.100 --> 01:37:00.340]  Trying to think of what close I have to.
[01:37:00.340 --> 01:37:03.940]  I used to, well, I do have some Grape Ape crosses
[01:37:03.940 --> 01:37:06.780]  that I've made 10 years ago now
[01:37:06.780 --> 01:37:09.180]  that the seeds really aren't that viable.
[01:37:10.980 --> 01:37:13.340]  So I haven't gone back to try those.
[01:37:13.340 --> 01:37:14.180]  And honestly-
[01:37:14.180 --> 01:37:16.100]  Yeah, they stopped us on the first one.
[01:37:16.100 --> 01:37:18.780]  Yeah, we've been through a few.
[01:37:19.740 --> 01:37:21.060]  I've grown Grape Ape.
[01:37:22.380 --> 01:37:24.540]  Dude, that, I'll tell you the most memorable thing
[01:37:24.540 --> 01:37:27.380]  about it is when you would cut a clone,
[01:37:27.380 --> 01:37:28.660]  the shit would leak out.
[01:37:28.660 --> 01:37:31.460]  It was a big ass, you know, like hollow stem
[01:37:31.460 --> 01:37:34.700]  and it would just drip out like sap.
[01:37:34.700 --> 01:37:38.700]  It was, I mean, I've seen other cultivars do it
[01:37:38.700 --> 01:37:40.420]  but this one was just like,
[01:37:41.300 --> 01:37:44.020]  it was like tapping a maple tree or something.
[01:37:44.020 --> 01:37:44.860]  You know what I mean?
[01:37:44.860 --> 01:37:46.020]  It was crazy as hell.
[01:37:46.020 --> 01:37:48.820]  So is it weird to want to taste the sap?
[01:37:48.820 --> 01:37:49.740]  Like, do you ever do that?
[01:37:49.740 --> 01:37:50.580]  You see it coming out and you're like-
[01:37:50.580 --> 01:37:51.420]  No, no, I do.
[01:37:51.420 --> 01:37:52.340]  The blood, the plant blood?
[01:37:52.340 --> 01:37:54.540]  Yeah, I'm a vampire like that.
[01:37:54.540 --> 01:37:55.540]  Okay, good man.
[01:37:55.540 --> 01:37:57.380]  I didn't know if I was weird or not for a second there.
[01:37:57.380 --> 01:37:58.220]  Look at that.
[01:37:58.220 --> 01:38:00.180]  There's the seed plug, look at this.
[01:38:00.180 --> 01:38:01.820]  This is a-
[01:38:01.820 --> 01:38:02.660]  Fuck.
[01:38:02.660 --> 01:38:05.740]  That's Dutch Bloom's CSA from whatever.
[01:38:05.740 --> 01:38:10.420]  Wow, he freaking really hooked that up.
[01:38:10.420 --> 01:38:13.100]  I mean, yeah, I got about 20 seeds of everything.
[01:38:13.100 --> 01:38:16.060]  Cocaine, hippos, black, wild, gold, wifi, mints,
[01:38:16.060 --> 01:38:17.380]  Sims, CBJ.
[01:38:17.380 --> 01:38:20.740]  I wanna like turn the camera.
[01:38:20.740 --> 01:38:21.780]  Back a little bit.
[01:38:23.180 --> 01:38:24.020]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[01:38:24.020 --> 01:38:24.860]  Oh, there we go.
[01:38:24.860 --> 01:38:28.740]  We want that hand on all those, man.
[01:38:28.740 --> 01:38:29.580]  Come on.
[01:38:29.580 --> 01:38:30.940]  It's all about the seed count.
[01:38:30.940 --> 01:38:31.780]  And you know what I'm saying?
[01:38:31.780 --> 01:38:34.220]  I don't give a shit about the package.
[01:38:34.220 --> 01:38:37.220]  I'm like the kid with the baseball cards in the back pocket.
[01:38:37.220 --> 01:38:38.860]  Not in the little, you know what I'm saying?
[01:38:38.860 --> 01:38:40.060]  In the binder.
[01:38:40.060 --> 01:38:41.100]  I just roll with them.
[01:38:41.100 --> 01:38:42.940]  Damn, Mike Mack.
[01:38:43.780 --> 01:38:44.620]  These are all initials, so I can't,
[01:38:44.620 --> 01:38:46.860]  there's a bunch of black, wild, gold.
[01:38:46.860 --> 01:38:51.540]  I grew the one he calls Post Malone.
[01:38:51.540 --> 01:38:55.140]  It was the only one I actually ran out of this CSA.
[01:38:55.140 --> 01:38:58.820]  And it's good.
[01:38:58.820 --> 01:39:00.500]  But then I crossed out with my Rambo
[01:39:00.500 --> 01:39:02.060]  and I call that John Malone.
[01:39:02.060 --> 01:39:06.020]  I'm like John Rambo and Post Malone.
[01:39:06.020 --> 01:39:08.340]  And then the funny part about it is,
[01:39:08.700 --> 01:39:13.300]  is I, my mom used to babysit this kid named John Malone,
[01:39:13.300 --> 01:39:14.180]  like every summer.
[01:39:14.180 --> 01:39:15.980]  He was from California.
[01:39:15.980 --> 01:39:18.260]  And he was like a little punk.
[01:39:18.260 --> 01:39:20.660]  Like we, you know, we like had to hang,
[01:39:20.660 --> 01:39:22.340]  you know, we were like forced to be his friend
[01:39:22.340 --> 01:39:24.140]  for like a month every summer.
[01:39:24.140 --> 01:39:25.060]  Like it was crazy.
[01:39:26.180 --> 01:39:28.380]  So if, hey, John Malone, if you're watching,
[01:39:28.380 --> 01:39:30.540]  I bet you still show me a boy.
[01:39:30.540 --> 01:39:33.380]  You know what it is?
[01:39:33.380 --> 01:39:36.020]  Shit still goes down around here, baby.
[01:39:36.020 --> 01:39:36.860]  I need to strain that for you.
[01:39:36.860 --> 01:39:38.180]  So go ahead boy.
[01:39:39.260 --> 01:39:40.100]  Don't sue me.
[01:39:40.100 --> 01:39:40.940]  Don't sue me.
[01:39:42.500 --> 01:39:46.260]  DJ Short, I know you were talking about Blueberry earlier.
[01:39:46.260 --> 01:39:47.540]  I did grow.
[01:39:47.540 --> 01:39:51.300]  So my DJ Short story is this is before,
[01:39:51.300 --> 01:39:53.860]  this is really early when the dispensaries came out.
[01:39:53.860 --> 01:39:57.380]  I didn't know much about breeders or cannabis or ever,
[01:39:57.380 --> 01:39:58.860]  and I was a DJ, right?
[01:39:58.860 --> 01:40:00.900]  So I go to the dispensary
[01:40:00.900 --> 01:40:03.980]  and I get a fat sack of DJ Short's Blueberry.
[01:40:03.980 --> 01:40:05.500]  I'm like, what a dipshit.
[01:40:05.540 --> 01:40:06.740]  I don't know how to do names.
[01:40:06.740 --> 01:40:08.420]  DJs love dropping names.
[01:40:08.420 --> 01:40:10.260]  Like it's just something that they do.
[01:40:10.260 --> 01:40:13.260]  So I thought a DJ put his own name on it.
[01:40:13.260 --> 01:40:15.780]  It's like, it's DJ Short's Blueberry.
[01:40:15.780 --> 01:40:17.820]  And I had a seed in there and I was like, whatever,
[01:40:17.820 --> 01:40:18.780]  fuck this guy.
[01:40:18.780 --> 01:40:21.260]  And I didn't do, I just like threw it away.
[01:40:21.260 --> 01:40:23.380]  And then I found out, oh, DJ Short.
[01:40:23.380 --> 01:40:24.220]  Okay.
[01:40:26.700 --> 01:40:29.620]  And I'm like, I wish I still had that seed, man.
[01:40:29.620 --> 01:40:33.740]  So that's my DJ Short Blueberry story right there.
[01:40:34.060 --> 01:40:35.500]  That's how I was telling you about the Chelsea.
[01:40:35.500 --> 01:40:38.140]  So I don't think you can buy them anymore,
[01:40:38.140 --> 01:40:41.260]  but yeah, when I got them off Nick, I guess it was 2020.
[01:40:42.140 --> 01:40:43.900]  But yeah, sugar cush.
[01:40:43.900 --> 01:40:44.860]  I still got three left.
[01:40:44.860 --> 01:40:47.100]  Like you said, I try to do the same.
[01:40:47.100 --> 01:40:50.220]  If I pop a 12 pack, I try to keep like one or two
[01:40:50.220 --> 01:40:53.500]  just in case like those go in the storage
[01:40:53.500 --> 01:40:55.220]  where it's like, you never know.
[01:40:55.220 --> 01:40:57.020]  In case it gets real crazy.
[01:40:57.020 --> 01:40:58.140]  How about this one?
[01:40:58.140 --> 01:40:59.020]  Here's a cool one.
[01:41:00.780 --> 01:41:02.900]  I'm throwing up all the hand-ready ones.
[01:41:02.940 --> 01:41:04.780]  Bacon dog from Family Tree.
[01:41:04.780 --> 01:41:06.100]  Nice.
[01:41:06.100 --> 01:41:10.180]  That is a dog walker times bacon grease.
[01:41:11.020 --> 01:41:14.340]  I might get in some of these soon here too.
[01:41:14.340 --> 01:41:16.620]  Yeah, and Mr. Trees did some really rad shows
[01:41:16.620 --> 01:41:20.620]  on Future Gannibus Project that really break down his lines
[01:41:20.620 --> 01:41:24.020]  and kind of like his selections and like the bacon grease.
[01:41:24.020 --> 01:41:27.260]  I think it was the oiliness of it.
[01:41:28.820 --> 01:41:32.260]  So yeah, he's a rad breeder
[01:41:32.620 --> 01:41:34.620]  because you can get the information directly from him.
[01:41:34.620 --> 01:41:36.660]  And he's very good at talking about shit.
[01:41:36.660 --> 01:41:41.660]  Yeah, he's a tree doctor, you know what I'm saying?
[01:41:41.780 --> 01:41:44.300]  A plant guy.
[01:41:44.300 --> 01:41:45.660]  More than a cannabis dude.
[01:41:46.540 --> 01:41:51.540]  Yeah, I met him the one time.
[01:41:51.620 --> 01:41:54.780]  We just hung out at a gene triggers event here.
[01:41:54.780 --> 01:41:56.780]  He came to Michigan and I kind of felt bad
[01:41:56.780 --> 01:41:58.060]  because it was just like,
[01:41:59.180 --> 01:42:00.780]  he came all the way from California.
[01:42:00.820 --> 01:42:04.140]  I was like, dude, you came to, you know what I mean?
[01:42:04.140 --> 01:42:07.020]  It's like those gene triggers events are kind of like a,
[01:42:07.020 --> 01:42:08.380]  it's kind of like a roughneck thing.
[01:42:08.380 --> 01:42:09.220]  You know what I'm saying?
[01:42:09.220 --> 01:42:10.780]  Is it like a swap meet?
[01:42:10.780 --> 01:42:12.620]  A swap meet at Jeanette's?
[01:42:12.620 --> 01:42:15.140]  It's a good place to meet people and hang out and do that.
[01:42:15.140 --> 01:42:19.060]  But it's not like, it's like make sure you lock your car.
[01:42:19.060 --> 01:42:21.820]  Don't leave a big fucking backpack sitting in your backseat.
[01:42:21.820 --> 01:42:22.660]  You know what I'm saying?
[01:42:22.660 --> 01:42:25.500]  Like the one in Detroit was like, oh shit.
[01:42:25.500 --> 01:42:27.220]  Detroit, bro, Detroit, come on.
[01:42:27.860 --> 01:42:30.420]  So I said earlier, I said earlier,
[01:42:30.420 --> 01:42:32.420]  we could go to Tiger's games
[01:42:32.420 --> 01:42:34.060]  and we go to Cubs games as a kid.
[01:42:34.060 --> 01:42:38.740]  And I remember to this day, walking down by Tiger Stadium
[01:42:38.740 --> 01:42:41.460]  and seeing a bookstore with bars on the window.
[01:42:41.460 --> 01:42:44.740]  I'm like, dad, why are there bars on the bookstore window?
[01:42:44.740 --> 01:42:46.540]  Who wants to steal books?
[01:42:46.540 --> 01:42:51.340]  Like it baffled me to the point it's so like in my mind.
[01:42:51.340 --> 01:42:54.820]  Detroit is a, you know, Detroit's a blue collar town.
[01:42:54.820 --> 01:42:55.660]  You know what I'm saying?
[01:42:55.660 --> 01:42:59.420]  It's like, don't be walking around flashing.
[01:42:59.420 --> 01:43:00.260]  You know what I'm saying?
[01:43:00.260 --> 01:43:01.100]  Don't be flashing.
[01:43:01.100 --> 01:43:01.940]  That's what I'm saying.
[01:43:01.940 --> 01:43:04.660]  It's not like, maybe it is pretty dangerous.
[01:43:04.660 --> 01:43:06.380]  I can't say if it is.
[01:43:06.380 --> 01:43:08.580]  Everywhere, everywhere has its problems.
[01:43:08.580 --> 01:43:09.420]  But don't be waiting.
[01:43:09.420 --> 01:43:10.260]  You know what I'm saying?
[01:43:10.260 --> 01:43:12.060]  You know how to stay in your fucking lane.
[01:43:12.060 --> 01:43:12.900]  You know what I'm saying?
[01:43:12.900 --> 01:43:15.060]  Don't be out there acting all cocky, peacocky.
[01:43:15.060 --> 01:43:17.260]  Don't count your money at the ATM.
[01:43:17.260 --> 01:43:19.100]  Yeah, don't count your money at the ATM
[01:43:19.100 --> 01:43:22.220]  with the brand new Rolex and your fur coat on and shit.
[01:43:22.220 --> 01:43:23.820]  Unless you can handle yourself.
[01:43:23.820 --> 01:43:24.660]  You know what I'm saying?
[01:43:24.660 --> 01:43:25.500]  You better buy it, right?
[01:43:25.500 --> 01:43:26.340]  You better buy it.
[01:43:26.340 --> 01:43:27.180]  You better buy it.
[01:43:27.180 --> 01:43:30.060]  Unless you got a car rolling deep behind you.
[01:43:30.060 --> 01:43:30.980]  Yeah.
[01:43:30.980 --> 01:43:32.500]  Yeah, when I was younger,
[01:43:32.500 --> 01:43:34.660]  I used to do a lot of gambling down in Detroit
[01:43:34.660 --> 01:43:37.180]  at the casinos when I still lived in Ohio.
[01:43:37.180 --> 01:43:39.700]  There was no casinos in Ohio, so.
[01:43:39.700 --> 01:43:40.540]  Right.
[01:43:40.540 --> 01:43:42.020]  Now is that down eight mile?
[01:43:42.020 --> 01:43:43.460]  Is that down eight mile road?
[01:43:43.460 --> 01:43:46.380]  The infamous Eminem, eight mile?
[01:43:46.380 --> 01:43:49.820]  No, the jean traders thing was on seven mile.
[01:43:49.820 --> 01:43:50.940]  Okay.
[01:43:50.940 --> 01:43:52.460]  It's just a block over.
[01:43:52.500 --> 01:43:55.540]  No, the gambling and shit is in downtown Detroit.
[01:43:55.540 --> 01:43:56.380]  Okay.
[01:43:56.380 --> 01:43:58.220]  Creek town, MGM.
[01:43:58.220 --> 01:43:59.500]  Shout out to Beacon.
[01:43:59.500 --> 01:44:01.420]  I know he works at one of those casinos.
[01:44:01.420 --> 01:44:02.460]  Beacon City.
[01:44:02.460 --> 01:44:04.420]  Yeah, he helped out with one of the auctions here
[01:44:04.420 --> 01:44:05.900]  that we had recently too.
[01:44:05.900 --> 01:44:06.740]  That was awesome.
[01:44:06.740 --> 01:44:07.580]  Yeah, he's a good dude.
[01:44:07.580 --> 01:44:08.420]  He's a good dude as well.
[01:44:08.420 --> 01:44:10.180]  I consider him a friend.
[01:44:11.180 --> 01:44:12.820]  Good homie.
[01:44:12.820 --> 01:44:13.780]  Yeah.
[01:44:13.780 --> 01:44:15.700]  So let's see here.
[01:44:15.700 --> 01:44:17.380]  Any more European packs?
[01:44:17.380 --> 01:44:19.060]  Let's see, you didn't really have-
[01:44:19.060 --> 01:44:20.740]  I didn't have no European shit.
[01:44:20.740 --> 01:44:22.380]  What are we talking about?
[01:44:23.260 --> 01:44:24.180]  America, baby.
[01:44:24.180 --> 01:44:25.340]  All my Sensi, yeah.
[01:44:25.340 --> 01:44:28.540]  All my Sensi stuff kind of came out of a package.
[01:44:28.540 --> 01:44:31.900]  So there's no packages on the Sensi stuff.
[01:44:32.780 --> 01:44:34.340]  I think I'm all American over here.
[01:44:34.340 --> 01:44:35.620]  I don't think we have any-
[01:44:36.820 --> 01:44:41.820]  I think I'm EU'd out right now.
[01:44:41.820 --> 01:44:45.180]  I had the big Buddha, I had the Royal Queen,
[01:44:45.180 --> 01:44:49.980]  I had the greenhouse.
[01:44:51.180 --> 01:44:52.020]  What else did I have?
[01:44:52.580 --> 01:44:55.060]  The Garden of Greens.
[01:44:56.460 --> 01:44:57.860]  And I actually just sent out,
[01:44:57.860 --> 01:45:00.580]  actually I just sent out some to another person.
[01:45:00.580 --> 01:45:05.180]  Actually, I mentioned the GoFundMe links earlier.
[01:45:05.180 --> 01:45:07.780]  The top link in the description section,
[01:45:07.780 --> 01:45:11.540]  I actually just sent him out a big package of seeds.
[01:45:11.540 --> 01:45:14.980]  And I sent a lot of the GR420 seeds
[01:45:14.980 --> 01:45:17.740]  that I had won from their website.
[01:45:17.740 --> 01:45:20.700]  They do a great job of just like getting beans out
[01:45:20.700 --> 01:45:22.460]  to people over in that area of the world,
[01:45:22.460 --> 01:45:25.260]  like to people who don't have access to them.
[01:45:25.260 --> 01:45:27.500]  So that's huge what they do.
[01:45:27.500 --> 01:45:28.700]  But I had won a bunch of seeds
[01:45:28.700 --> 01:45:31.900]  and I knew I had already grown a pack of those before.
[01:45:31.900 --> 01:45:33.820]  I knew I wasn't gonna get to them anytime soon.
[01:45:33.820 --> 01:45:36.180]  So I said, hey dude, here you go.
[01:45:36.180 --> 01:45:37.740]  I sent him a variety of things.
[01:45:37.740 --> 01:45:40.260]  And I was just like, here, try it.
[01:45:40.260 --> 01:45:43.020]  Here's some auto flowers, use this for your training wheels.
[01:45:43.020 --> 01:45:43.940]  Here's some FEMs.
[01:45:43.940 --> 01:45:48.060]  So you don't have to worry about your space and using that
[01:45:48.060 --> 01:45:50.500]  because this person needs their medicine.
[01:45:51.300 --> 01:45:52.060]  And they don't have time to sort out the mail.
[01:45:52.060 --> 01:45:55.820]  So that's all I've got on the European tip.
[01:45:55.820 --> 01:45:57.700]  Yeah, I don't have, it's crazy.
[01:45:57.700 --> 01:45:58.980]  I guess they stopped me right away.
[01:45:58.980 --> 01:46:00.580]  I don't have any European shit.
[01:46:00.580 --> 01:46:02.580]  I just want to be good.
[01:46:02.580 --> 01:46:06.320]  I mean, these guys and girls in here are good though
[01:46:06.320 --> 01:46:08.940]  because they are throwing up a lot of these classic strains.
[01:46:08.940 --> 01:46:10.860]  I'm like, oh man, I wish I had that.
[01:46:10.860 --> 01:46:13.020]  And I'm trying to think of something that I had in it.
[01:46:13.020 --> 01:46:16.380]  Joey Soprano, throwing up some good stuff.
[01:46:16.380 --> 01:46:18.140]  The Sweet Island Skunk.
[01:46:19.440 --> 01:46:20.280]  Let's see where else.
[01:46:21.040 --> 01:46:24.240]  You had the New York Diesel, Headband.
[01:46:24.240 --> 01:46:26.240]  So what are my favorite strains?
[01:46:26.240 --> 01:46:27.480]  You do, all right.
[01:46:27.480 --> 01:46:28.820]  I have a headband.
[01:46:29.880 --> 01:46:31.840]  Oh fuck, I have a headband.
[01:46:31.840 --> 01:46:33.880]  707 headband is what I got.
[01:46:33.880 --> 01:46:34.720]  Nice.
[01:46:34.720 --> 01:46:35.560]  Oh no, what's that one?
[01:46:35.560 --> 01:46:37.440]  That's Truthband right there.
[01:46:37.440 --> 01:46:39.280]  Very nice.
[01:46:39.280 --> 01:46:41.520]  I seen, okay, here we go.
[01:46:41.520 --> 01:46:44.300]  A Williams Wonder, open pollination.
[01:46:44.300 --> 01:46:45.140]  Boom.
[01:46:46.160 --> 01:46:47.000]  Okay.
[01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:49.520]  LFA seeds.
[01:46:50.120 --> 01:46:51.740]  So Williams Wonder.
[01:46:52.880 --> 01:46:54.560]  I remember smoking it back in the day
[01:46:54.560 --> 01:46:55.880]  when I was like in high school.
[01:46:55.880 --> 01:46:57.020]  This is an old strain.
[01:46:58.400 --> 01:46:59.840]  AK Bean Brains came on.
[01:46:59.840 --> 01:47:02.280]  We did a show together this year
[01:47:02.280 --> 01:47:05.720]  and he gave the origins of that Williams Wonder.
[01:47:05.720 --> 01:47:08.480]  It's a Williams Oregon, it's kind of an older guy,
[01:47:09.320 --> 01:47:12.700]  but he gave us the full rundown on that,
[01:47:12.700 --> 01:47:14.120]  which was interesting.
[01:47:14.120 --> 01:47:16.680]  All burnt out, geez.
[01:47:16.680 --> 01:47:17.920]  Cat piss, I wish.
[01:47:17.920 --> 01:47:18.760]  No, no.
[01:47:19.280 --> 01:47:20.440]  No cat piss.
[01:47:20.440 --> 01:47:23.600]  I have what I jokingly call squirrel piss.
[01:47:23.600 --> 01:47:25.700]  So anybody's interested in my squirrel piss,
[01:47:25.700 --> 01:47:26.800]  I've got some for you.
[01:47:30.040 --> 01:47:31.920]  See, Daze from the garden.
[01:47:31.920 --> 01:47:34.080]  He says he has Truthband.
[01:47:34.080 --> 01:47:36.320]  Yes, he does have Truthband.
[01:47:39.240 --> 01:47:41.540]  Boom, right there for you.
[01:47:42.400 --> 01:47:43.800]  Yeah, Truthband.
[01:47:45.280 --> 01:47:48.440]  What, IRIE Genetics, isn't his thing,
[01:47:49.200 --> 01:47:52.640]  the Arise, isn't that what he bred all his shit with?
[01:47:52.640 --> 01:47:55.880]  So I got a Arise F2 right there.
[01:47:55.880 --> 01:47:59.600]  Nice, so Lemon Sunrise or Lemon Arise,
[01:47:59.600 --> 01:48:01.880]  God, I need to find that pack now.
[01:48:01.880 --> 01:48:03.680]  That was one you said earlier,
[01:48:03.680 --> 01:48:07.200]  you had big ceilings and the plant grew too tall.
[01:48:07.200 --> 01:48:10.920]  That is one that, dude, it took over my tent so quickly.
[01:48:10.920 --> 01:48:12.680]  Like it's just a massive thing.
[01:48:12.680 --> 01:48:14.800]  It was good smoke.
[01:48:14.800 --> 01:48:18.360]  If I grew outdoors, I would absolutely plant that
[01:48:19.120 --> 01:48:22.000]  but I don't think it's got room in my tent right now.
[01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:25.320]  But yeah, Rasta Jeff, solid individual, good genetics.
[01:48:25.320 --> 01:48:29.320]  Again, someone who's very up front.
[01:48:29.320 --> 01:48:31.160]  Sweet and sour Cindy.
[01:48:31.160 --> 01:48:35.180]  Yeah, bog sweet Cindy times bog sour bubble.
[01:48:36.120 --> 01:48:37.720]  Rest in peace to bog.
[01:48:37.720 --> 01:48:41.360]  We mentioned, oh yeah, look, see, too bad Dave's not here.
[01:48:45.240 --> 01:48:47.880]  That's when we all had a little bonding moment.
[01:48:48.400 --> 01:48:50.280]  He didn't even know he was gonna call that.
[01:48:50.280 --> 01:48:52.320]  And I think it was like Snow Keys or something.
[01:48:52.320 --> 01:48:57.320]  But then Rab said something or other
[01:48:57.800 --> 01:48:59.400]  and we're like, zoo kids.
[01:48:59.400 --> 01:49:02.320]  We all kind of, it was like an inside kind of joke thing.
[01:49:02.320 --> 01:49:05.320]  And then he named the cultivar of that.
[01:49:06.280 --> 01:49:09.040]  He's got clever naming for those things.
[01:49:09.040 --> 01:49:11.000]  Like I like his name, you know, again, Melvin's.
[01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:13.960]  That was a reference to the band, The Boss,
[01:49:13.960 --> 01:49:16.640]  which I've got here, dude, Brian Bosworth.
[01:49:16.640 --> 01:49:17.720]  I've covered this on the show,
[01:49:17.720 --> 01:49:19.760]  but Brian Bosworth was such a character.
[01:49:20.960 --> 01:49:23.120]  And I lived in Seattle at the time he was here.
[01:49:23.120 --> 01:49:26.040]  So yeah, I love his names.
[01:49:26.040 --> 01:49:28.600]  Sometimes the names try to follow the lineage
[01:49:28.600 --> 01:49:33.480]  and give, you know, like props to where it came from.
[01:49:33.480 --> 01:49:36.040]  Other times the names are just fucking so random
[01:49:36.040 --> 01:49:38.840]  that it doesn't even matter.
[01:49:38.840 --> 01:49:40.000]  That's one of the toughest thing.
[01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:40.840]  You know what I mean?
[01:49:40.840 --> 01:49:42.840]  I mean, I always just try to write down
[01:49:42.840 --> 01:49:45.240]  what I'm crossing, obviously, to remember.
[01:49:45.240 --> 01:49:49.320]  But it's like the hardest thing.
[01:49:49.320 --> 01:49:51.240]  Anytime I think I got a good name,
[01:49:51.240 --> 01:49:53.360]  like, oh, this would be an awesome name.
[01:49:53.360 --> 01:49:55.080]  Just Google it, like Jesus.
[01:49:55.080 --> 01:49:55.920]  It comes right out.
[01:49:55.920 --> 01:49:57.760]  I'm like, oh my God.
[01:49:57.760 --> 01:49:58.600]  I know.
[01:49:58.600 --> 01:50:00.320]  Go back to the drawing board.
[01:50:00.320 --> 01:50:02.320]  Yeah, or you just be shameless about it
[01:50:02.320 --> 01:50:03.160]  and be like, you know what?
[01:50:03.160 --> 01:50:04.160]  Fuck it, I'm rolling with it.
[01:50:04.160 --> 01:50:05.360]  Take it, Gorilla Glue.
[01:50:05.360 --> 01:50:07.560]  Well, yeah, so I was calling my Rambo,
[01:50:07.560 --> 01:50:09.200]  originally I was just calling it Rambo.
[01:50:09.200 --> 01:50:13.480]  And the reason was because it's Ambrosia, OG Kush Breath.
[01:50:13.520 --> 01:50:15.280]  It was kind of like when I first,
[01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:20.560]  OG, you know, I just kind of turned into Rambo.
[01:50:20.560 --> 01:50:23.720]  But then I found out someone else had a Rambo out.
[01:50:23.720 --> 01:50:26.280]  Like, all right, we'll just call it Rambo Breath.
[01:50:26.280 --> 01:50:30.320]  I think, I forget who recommended that.
[01:50:30.320 --> 01:50:31.800]  I was like, yeah, let's do that.
[01:50:31.800 --> 01:50:32.640]  Rambo Breath.
[01:50:32.640 --> 01:50:35.880]  Yeah, I mean, pretty much whenever I give seeds out,
[01:50:35.880 --> 01:50:37.440]  like, I mean, I said, it's like,
[01:50:37.440 --> 01:50:39.080]  this is my label right here.
[01:50:39.080 --> 01:50:40.760]  It's usually just the crosses.
[01:50:40.760 --> 01:50:42.400]  Like, they don't really have names.
[01:50:42.440 --> 01:50:44.240]  It's usually just the crosses that I've done
[01:50:44.240 --> 01:50:45.880]  or that I've worked and I send them out.
[01:50:45.880 --> 01:50:48.360]  And I was kind of always like, yeah, you know,
[01:50:48.360 --> 01:50:50.480]  I kind of wanna, you know,
[01:50:50.480 --> 01:50:52.480]  we're standing on the shoulders of giants.
[01:50:52.480 --> 01:50:53.320]  Absolutely true.
[01:50:53.320 --> 01:50:54.800]  I'm working with other people's work
[01:50:54.800 --> 01:50:57.280]  and I'm doing my selections and I'm trying to rework them
[01:50:57.280 --> 01:50:59.120]  and try to make them my own things.
[01:50:59.120 --> 01:51:01.960]  But long story short, I was always passing them out
[01:51:01.960 --> 01:51:04.680]  as, you know, what was crossed to give credit to people.
[01:51:04.680 --> 01:51:06.080]  And I was on a breeders panel,
[01:51:06.080 --> 01:51:10.400]  the Caribou Heart Show with Jinxproof.
[01:51:10.400 --> 01:51:12.240]  And that's someone who, you know, I look up to
[01:51:13.080 --> 01:51:13.920]  and they ask, they're like, so, you know,
[01:51:13.920 --> 01:51:16.000]  what goes into a name and how do you name them?
[01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:17.960]  Or what's important in the name?
[01:51:17.960 --> 01:51:20.880]  And I was like, opening my mouth to say exactly
[01:51:20.880 --> 01:51:22.040]  what I just said.
[01:51:22.040 --> 01:51:23.680]  And Jinxproof is like, you know what?
[01:51:23.680 --> 01:51:25.840]  I just make up names because given like,
[01:51:25.840 --> 01:51:27.160]  putting the straight names in there,
[01:51:27.160 --> 01:51:28.200]  that's just fucking lame.
[01:51:28.200 --> 01:51:32.000]  I was like, glad I didn't say that.
[01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:37.000]  Yeah, look, Jinx was the first, like, I don't know,
[01:51:37.040 --> 01:51:39.640]  like breeder or anything I ever met at like one of the shows,
[01:51:39.640 --> 01:51:40.480]  you know what I mean?
[01:51:40.480 --> 01:51:43.040]  Like, it was like weird.
[01:51:43.040 --> 01:51:45.680]  So I was like, I was like kind of nervous
[01:51:45.680 --> 01:51:47.000]  when I fucking met him, you know what I mean?
[01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:49.920]  I'm like, you know, and then after that,
[01:51:49.920 --> 01:51:51.760]  it just got the ball rolling, you know what I'm saying?
[01:51:51.760 --> 01:51:54.480]  Kind of just let me know, like, it's all good.
[01:51:54.480 --> 01:51:57.120]  I'm just Jinxproof, you know what I'm saying?
[01:51:57.120 --> 01:51:58.240]  He's super cool.
[01:51:58.240 --> 01:52:00.760]  Yeah, and his naming is crazy.
[01:52:00.760 --> 01:52:04.000]  Like this, I actually gave the rest of the seeds away
[01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:06.040]  again in that pack, but this is the last of it.
[01:52:06.040 --> 01:52:08.720]  But this was the, this is the last of the bud,
[01:52:09.240 --> 01:52:10.760]  it's it, that's the name of it.
[01:52:10.760 --> 01:52:14.480]  It was a cross of like the shit and it's fire.
[01:52:14.480 --> 01:52:16.480]  So they just called it, it's it.
[01:52:16.480 --> 01:52:19.760]  I mean, what's in a name?
[01:52:19.760 --> 01:52:21.520]  I'm grown at nine pound.
[01:52:21.520 --> 01:52:26.440]  I've grown something tongue.
[01:52:26.440 --> 01:52:29.400]  It's like a one-to-one, I believe, mother tongue.
[01:52:30.440 --> 01:52:32.080]  And then what else have I grown?
[01:52:34.040 --> 01:52:36.120]  I had this one that was like a,
[01:52:36.120 --> 01:52:37.400]  I don't think he ever released it.
[01:52:37.400 --> 01:52:41.800]  It was, give me a second.
[01:52:41.800 --> 01:52:43.000]  What was it?
[01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:44.040]  It was so fire.
[01:52:44.040 --> 01:52:45.200]  I should have kept it.
[01:52:45.200 --> 01:52:46.520]  It was so good.
[01:52:46.520 --> 01:52:50.080]  Very like, kind of like wimpy plant,
[01:52:50.080 --> 01:52:51.800]  but the herb was so good.
[01:52:51.800 --> 01:52:53.280]  What the hell was it called?
[01:52:53.280 --> 01:52:54.960]  Damn, I can't remember.
[01:52:54.960 --> 01:52:57.520]  It's the head stash weed when it's a bitch to grow,
[01:52:57.520 --> 01:52:59.560]  but you still do it anyway.
[01:52:59.560 --> 01:53:03.320]  Right, like a Skittles kind of deal, for sure.
[01:53:03.320 --> 01:53:05.080]  Yeah, man.
[01:53:05.080 --> 01:53:06.200]  What's up?
[01:53:06.240 --> 01:53:07.760]  Can we do a seed giveaway on here?
[01:53:07.760 --> 01:53:09.120]  Can I give away some seeds?
[01:53:09.120 --> 01:53:10.000]  Absolutely.
[01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:10.840]  These people would love it.
[01:53:10.840 --> 01:53:11.680]  How do you do it?
[01:53:11.680 --> 01:53:12.520]  How do you run one of those?
[01:53:12.520 --> 01:53:13.360]  You know, typically we-
[01:53:13.360 --> 01:53:14.200]  What are we doing?
[01:53:14.200 --> 01:53:15.120]  Pick a number?
[01:53:15.120 --> 01:53:17.200]  Yeah, and then if you want to pick a number,
[01:53:17.200 --> 01:53:18.640]  we'll put it in the private chat
[01:53:18.640 --> 01:53:21.680]  and we could say, you know, one guess only,
[01:53:21.680 --> 01:53:24.080]  or people can guess number of times.
[01:53:24.080 --> 01:53:25.040]  That's always harder
[01:53:25.040 --> 01:53:28.120]  because everybody just goes one, ba-ba-ba-bum.
[01:53:28.120 --> 01:53:29.880]  But we can do it however you like it.
[01:53:29.880 --> 01:53:32.640]  Closest to it, whoever's under,
[01:53:32.640 --> 01:53:35.240]  is closest if it's a tie between under or over.
[01:53:35.240 --> 01:53:36.080]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:53:36.080 --> 01:53:39.480]  Hey, Mark, look, we got Chelsea times Testerosa,
[01:53:39.480 --> 01:53:43.960]  Chelsea, or no, we got Skunk Boat times Testerosa.
[01:53:43.960 --> 01:53:45.320]  It's just gonna be a care pick.
[01:53:45.320 --> 01:53:47.400]  It'll be some, it's gonna be all my seeds.
[01:53:47.400 --> 01:53:51.560]  Rambo cookies I got, GMO, Gorilla cookies.
[01:53:51.560 --> 01:53:54.640]  I don't know, I'm just gonna put you together a nice,
[01:53:54.640 --> 01:53:57.080]  we'll call it the seed collector show pack,
[01:53:57.080 --> 01:53:59.000]  just to do something for the people,
[01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:00.160]  you know what I'm saying, paying it forward.
[01:54:00.160 --> 01:54:02.920]  So I'll put some of my slaps in there
[01:54:02.920 --> 01:54:07.280]  and then Chad, I'll probably message you
[01:54:07.280 --> 01:54:09.680]  and make sure I get you some stuff
[01:54:09.680 --> 01:54:10.960]  to add to your collection as well,
[01:54:10.960 --> 01:54:13.600]  just for being such a courteous guy,
[01:54:13.600 --> 01:54:15.000]  a great guy to the community.
[01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:18.360]  I appreciate everything you do and all this and that.
[01:54:18.360 --> 01:54:21.660]  So what, you want me to put the number in the chat?
[01:54:21.660 --> 01:54:23.320]  How many people are in?
[01:54:23.320 --> 01:54:27.040]  Let's see here, we've got 187 watching right now.
[01:54:27.040 --> 01:54:29.840]  Wow, we should pick a Snoop Dogg song.
[01:54:29.840 --> 01:54:33.360]  What Snoop Dogg song are you thinking of right now?
[01:54:33.360 --> 01:54:35.800]  So we'll go with that, wait till we say start,
[01:54:35.800 --> 01:54:37.640]  if that's what we're gonna roll with.
[01:54:40.040 --> 01:54:41.000]  In the meantime though,
[01:54:41.000 --> 01:54:42.920]  after that conversation with Jinx Proof,
[01:54:42.920 --> 01:54:45.920]  I said, fuck it, I'm making up names and I'm shameless.
[01:54:45.920 --> 01:54:48.760]  So Nakatomi Plaza, baby.
[01:54:48.760 --> 01:54:51.680]  These are the first beans
[01:54:51.680 --> 01:54:55.480]  with actual proper stickers coming out for you.
[01:54:55.480 --> 01:54:59.120]  That's gonna be on the Dega.Garden site in December,
[01:54:59.120 --> 01:55:00.080]  drop in December.
[01:55:00.080 --> 01:55:01.920]  I mean, could you freaking really,
[01:55:01.920 --> 01:55:04.680]  oh, where'd Tommy go, I'm by myself.
[01:55:04.680 --> 01:55:06.040]  It's all right, I can talk.
[01:55:07.280 --> 01:55:08.440]  He hit the wrong button.
[01:55:09.640 --> 01:55:12.080]  I mean, really, can you have a Die Hard release
[01:55:12.080 --> 01:55:14.840]  without dropping it in December?
[01:55:14.840 --> 01:55:15.680]  I don't think so.
[01:55:15.680 --> 01:55:19.440]  So dropping in December on the Dega.Garden site.
[01:55:19.440 --> 01:55:24.440]  And again, Tommy's trying to join back in right now.
[01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:28.280]  Okay, he picked a number for me.
[01:55:28.280 --> 01:55:31.320]  He picked a number, but we'll wait till he pops back in.
[01:55:31.320 --> 01:55:32.280]  It's gonna be cool.
[01:55:32.280 --> 01:55:33.360]  Whatever he throws together,
[01:55:33.360 --> 01:55:34.840]  you guys have kind of seen a little bit
[01:55:34.840 --> 01:55:36.400]  of his collection tonight.
[01:55:36.400 --> 01:55:40.560]  And you guys have had some pretty awesome feedback
[01:55:40.560 --> 01:55:42.640]  and some suggestions in the chat too.
[01:55:42.640 --> 01:55:47.440]  That headband is one that I wouldn't mind getting.
[01:55:47.440 --> 01:55:49.440]  One of my favorite strains that I grew
[01:55:49.440 --> 01:55:52.080]  and have worked for years, it was a bag seed.
[01:55:52.080 --> 01:55:54.360]  I just called it brown, but it does.
[01:55:54.360 --> 01:55:57.520]  It just gives me that just like layer right here.
[01:55:57.560 --> 01:55:59.640]  Just like tingly happiness.
[01:55:59.640 --> 01:56:01.000]  It's a fun effect.
[01:56:01.000 --> 01:56:03.560]  I don't know if it's a minor cannabinoid,
[01:56:03.560 --> 01:56:07.040]  what it is about it, but that strain always does it for me.
[01:56:07.040 --> 01:56:09.520]  And it was one of my favorites.
[01:56:09.520 --> 01:56:12.080]  But when you do the jar test at parties,
[01:56:12.080 --> 01:56:15.280]  it was never the first jar empty.
[01:56:15.280 --> 01:56:17.760]  And I did it numerous times because I loved it,
[01:56:17.760 --> 01:56:19.480]  but it just never worked out.
[01:56:20.420 --> 01:56:23.900]  I see Tommy, let's see, device not connected.
[01:56:24.780 --> 01:56:27.260]  I don't know if you got a phone call or a text,
[01:56:28.140 --> 01:56:32.980]  but maybe try restarting or log in all the way out.
[01:56:32.980 --> 01:56:35.260]  If you can hear me, I see you're in the queue,
[01:56:35.260 --> 01:56:36.900]  but it just says device not connected,
[01:56:36.900 --> 01:56:41.340]  which usually is a platform issue.
[01:56:41.340 --> 01:56:44.580]  Like we use StreamYard when we stream everybody.
[01:56:44.580 --> 01:56:46.020]  We don't use Zoom, we use StreamYard
[01:56:46.020 --> 01:56:49.780]  so we can do cool things like put comments up
[01:56:49.780 --> 01:56:51.860]  and do all that stuff.
[01:56:51.860 --> 01:56:55.740]  The number range we'll get to in a second.
[01:56:55.740 --> 01:57:00.500]  Oh, Tommy's trying to join and it's not working.
[01:57:00.500 --> 01:57:02.940]  I mean, we are at about the two hour point of the show,
[01:57:02.940 --> 01:57:04.900]  which is where we usually try to stop it,
[01:57:04.900 --> 01:57:09.900]  but we got some beans to give away here.
[01:57:11.580 --> 01:57:14.380]  So we'll let Tommy try to rejoin here
[01:57:14.380 --> 01:57:16.460]  for another couple of minutes.
[01:57:16.460 --> 01:57:21.140]  And if not, I'm gonna like give all his beans away for him.
[01:57:21.140 --> 01:57:23.420]  So no, I won't do that.
[01:57:23.420 --> 01:57:24.700]  He did give me a number though.
[01:57:24.700 --> 01:57:26.980]  So we got one contest going at least.
[01:57:26.980 --> 01:57:29.180]  We'll have one going and he's a good dude.
[01:57:30.780 --> 01:57:32.900]  Dog days can't stop after two hours.
[01:57:32.900 --> 01:57:35.000]  Duke show was four hours.
[01:57:35.980 --> 01:57:37.780]  Yes, it was four hours.
[01:57:41.900 --> 01:57:46.700]  Let me send you another invite link, Tommy.
[01:57:46.700 --> 01:57:48.940]  He's trying guys, he's trying.
[01:57:48.940 --> 01:57:51.340]  He's in the background popping in,
[01:57:51.340 --> 01:57:56.340]  but sometimes if it's a tablet or an Amazon tablet
[01:57:56.780 --> 01:58:00.620]  or like phones like that, it's, oh, that's Dave.
[01:58:00.620 --> 01:58:01.500]  Whoops, sorry, Dave.
[01:58:01.500 --> 01:58:02.580]  I just sent you the show link
[01:58:02.580 --> 01:58:04.480]  if you're still awake and listening.
[01:58:05.820 --> 01:58:06.660]  There you go.
[01:58:06.660 --> 01:58:07.480]  Okay, there's Tommy.
[01:58:11.420 --> 01:58:15.500]  Stoner moment brought to you by Pre91chem.
[01:58:15.500 --> 01:58:16.760]  It's what I'm smoking.
[01:58:16.760 --> 01:58:18.940]  And that's why I forgot what I was talking about.
[01:58:18.940 --> 01:58:21.900]  So I'll go back and look at chat.
[01:58:21.900 --> 01:58:22.740]  Oh yeah, two hours.
[01:58:22.740 --> 01:58:23.700]  Duke show was long one.
[01:58:23.700 --> 01:58:25.580]  That was, it was four hours.
[01:58:25.580 --> 01:58:27.300]  Oh, son of a beast.
[01:58:28.140 --> 01:58:30.500]  Tommy, no.
[01:58:31.940 --> 01:58:33.980]  I don't know if it's gonna work, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:58:33.980 --> 01:58:36.340]  So let's do this.
[01:58:36.340 --> 01:58:39.260]  Cause he's again, he's trying again and I see it.
[01:58:39.260 --> 01:58:41.020]  Oh, he's in my private chat.
[01:58:41.020 --> 01:58:42.700]  He says, I'm trying.
[01:58:42.700 --> 01:58:47.540]  Yeah, if you're on a laptop, you got to use Google Chrome.
[01:58:47.540 --> 01:58:49.100]  Again, StreamYard, not Zoom.
[01:58:49.100 --> 01:58:51.580]  StreamYard wants Google Chrome.
[01:58:51.580 --> 01:58:54.740]  If you're on a phone, make sure it's,
[01:58:54.740 --> 01:58:56.620]  again, Google Chrome.
[01:58:56.620 --> 01:58:58.660]  I know Amazon, like tablets or phones,
[01:58:58.660 --> 01:59:00.180]  Silk is the default browser.
[01:59:00.180 --> 01:59:01.100]  That doesn't work.
[01:59:01.100 --> 01:59:03.860]  Safari doesn't work as well.
[01:59:03.860 --> 01:59:06.680]  It's gotta be that Google Chrome as your browser.
[01:59:06.680 --> 01:59:09.460]  And I had to install that on my tablet.
[01:59:09.460 --> 01:59:12.720]  It was a bitch to do, but it's possible.
[01:59:13.720 --> 01:59:18.200]  All right, so we are gonna do this
[01:59:18.200 --> 01:59:21.080]  because I know he is trying
[01:59:21.080 --> 01:59:22.760]  and it doesn't look like it's working.
[01:59:22.760 --> 01:59:24.160]  So, all right.
[01:59:24.160 --> 01:59:26.740]  So the number range is,
[01:59:30.250 --> 01:59:33.230]  there's 173 people watching.
[01:59:33.230 --> 01:59:34.450]  I like that number.
[01:59:34.450 --> 01:59:35.690]  I didn't pick the numbers guys.
[01:59:35.690 --> 01:59:37.290]  So it's not one, seven, three,
[01:59:37.290 --> 01:59:39.770]  more than likely not that number.
[01:59:39.770 --> 01:59:41.690]  Why not use Zoom?
[01:59:41.690 --> 01:59:44.450]  Zoom can't do cool things
[01:59:44.450 --> 01:59:46.930]  like put up comments on the screen.
[01:59:46.930 --> 01:59:50.090]  Like really, Zoom could put up comments.
[01:59:50.090 --> 01:59:53.850]  I would love to use it, but interacting with chat,
[01:59:53.850 --> 01:59:57.170]  you guys, such a huge part of the show.
[01:59:57.170 --> 01:59:59.410]  It, like earlier we were doing,
[01:59:59.410 --> 02:00:02.090]  name a strain or a breeder for us to pull out.
[02:00:02.090 --> 02:00:03.330]  It really helps drive it.
[02:00:03.330 --> 02:00:05.970]  And we love to get you guys up on the screen,
[02:00:05.970 --> 02:00:08.090]  get you a little support and thank you.
[02:00:08.090 --> 02:00:09.570]  So yeah, purple thumb.
[02:00:09.810 --> 02:00:11.730]  That's why we're using the StreamYard
[02:00:11.730 --> 02:00:13.750]  cause you can't do that stuff in Zoom.
[02:00:14.930 --> 02:00:16.170]  All right, and so Tommy, yeah,
[02:00:16.170 --> 02:00:17.810]  he's finally saying he's here.
[02:00:17.810 --> 02:00:21.470]  He's popping in and out like a,
[02:00:21.470 --> 02:00:23.130]  oh, that's an inappropriate joke.
[02:00:24.250 --> 02:00:25.650]  He says, do the giveaway though.
[02:00:25.650 --> 02:00:27.090]  He's in the private chat, do the giveaway.
[02:00:27.090 --> 02:00:28.010]  I don't know what's happening.
[02:00:28.010 --> 02:00:32.010]  He's trying, but we're at two hour mark anyways.
[02:00:32.010 --> 02:00:34.610]  Okay, so without much further ado,
[02:00:34.610 --> 02:00:36.330]  we're gonna go ahead and we're gonna do this.
[02:00:36.330 --> 02:00:39.050]  We're gonna go one through 420.
[02:00:39.490 --> 02:00:41.890]  Wait for me to type start into the chat.
[02:00:43.090 --> 02:00:45.490]  And Tommy has already given me the number.
[02:00:45.490 --> 02:00:48.210]  So I know what number I'm looking for.
[02:00:48.210 --> 02:00:49.550]  One to 420.
[02:00:52.870 --> 02:00:54.490]  Let me type start.
[02:00:54.490 --> 02:00:59.490]  And this is for a grab bag pack for Mr. Tommy Tricombs.
[02:01:00.330 --> 02:01:03.230]  And as you saw, his things are pretty bad ass.
[02:01:03.230 --> 02:01:06.130]  All right, so Roman Reckless, he's in there already.
[02:01:06.130 --> 02:01:07.450]  We've got the numbers coming.
[02:01:07.850 --> 02:01:09.650]  Oh my God, they're going so fast.
[02:01:10.570 --> 02:01:13.250]  Okay, so I'm just gonna set a clock
[02:01:13.250 --> 02:01:17.450]  and then see what we can do
[02:01:17.450 --> 02:01:22.450]  as far as watching this and staying on track.
[02:01:24.390 --> 02:01:26.050]  Okay, so I'm looking for the number,
[02:01:26.050 --> 02:01:27.070]  looking for the number.
[02:01:27.070 --> 02:01:29.530]  I'll probably find the number soon enough
[02:01:29.530 --> 02:01:31.170]  because there's a lot of you in chat.
[02:01:31.170 --> 02:01:32.750]  And everybody again, thanks for hanging out.
[02:01:32.750 --> 02:01:35.970]  Thanks for being a big part of these seed collector shows.
[02:01:36.010 --> 02:01:39.450]  I love doing them and you guys seem to enjoy watching them.
[02:01:39.450 --> 02:01:43.010]  So we're gonna be bringing on a lot of people in the future.
[02:01:43.010 --> 02:01:46.690]  I think we're gonna be maybe doing two episodes a month.
[02:01:46.690 --> 02:01:51.370]  I know this is a month where we're going to do two episodes
[02:01:51.370 --> 02:01:56.010]  and our next guest is gonna be Mean Gene.
[02:01:56.010 --> 02:01:58.290]  I'm very freaking excited about that.
[02:01:58.290 --> 02:02:00.290]  Mean Gene, Freeborn Selections,
[02:02:00.290 --> 02:02:02.730]  someone who you've seen on this channel a lot.
[02:02:02.730 --> 02:02:05.230]  You've seen us talk about them.
[02:02:05.230 --> 02:02:08.950]  We always are excited when we see the seeds
[02:02:08.950 --> 02:02:13.290]  on the show, on the program.
[02:02:13.290 --> 02:02:17.030]  So I'm still scrolling through here.
[02:02:17.030 --> 02:02:19.230]  So that should be,
[02:02:19.230 --> 02:02:22.910]  I believe we're gonna aim for the 16th on that one
[02:02:23.830 --> 02:02:27.670]  because I'm going to Mexico
[02:02:27.670 --> 02:02:30.130]  and I will be back shortly before then.
[02:02:30.130 --> 02:02:33.230]  So yep, it'll be Wednesday the 16th.
[02:02:33.230 --> 02:02:36.430]  Mean Gene is who Dave has lined up.
[02:02:36.430 --> 02:02:37.670]  And again, Dave will be back.
[02:02:37.670 --> 02:02:40.550]  Dave's just, he didn't really spontaneously combust
[02:02:40.550 --> 02:02:42.750]  because the seed collection was so fire.
[02:02:42.750 --> 02:02:44.570]  I lied, sorry.
[02:02:46.590 --> 02:02:48.250]  He's just a little under the weather tonight.
[02:02:48.250 --> 02:02:49.790]  So hopefully he feels better.
[02:02:49.790 --> 02:02:53.990]  Everybody send him a e-card.
[02:02:53.990 --> 02:02:55.590]  He would love that.
[02:02:55.590 --> 02:02:59.230]  I always put his Instagram in the show notes.
[02:02:59.230 --> 02:03:00.190]  And again, in the show notes,
[02:03:00.190 --> 02:03:04.190]  you can always find the guests, their Instagram.
[02:03:04.190 --> 02:03:05.670]  You can also find a lot of the links
[02:03:05.670 --> 02:03:08.310]  to the different websites for Dog-Eyed Lap Garden,
[02:03:08.310 --> 02:03:10.310]  for the Future Cannabis Project.
[02:03:10.310 --> 02:03:15.310]  And also those GoFundMes that I had mentioned earlier.
[02:03:15.750 --> 02:03:17.390]  Dammit, Tommy, I see you, dude.
[02:03:17.390 --> 02:03:22.390]  You are trying so hard, but you're just not getting in.
[02:03:22.630 --> 02:03:26.310]  And we've got 30 seconds left of guesses.
[02:03:26.310 --> 02:03:29.650]  So I'm just gonna do that little countdown here in my head.
[02:03:29.950 --> 02:03:31.810]  Everybody, thanks for playing along.
[02:03:31.810 --> 02:03:36.810]  And how we'll work this is you can DM me your name
[02:03:38.090 --> 02:03:41.510]  and address, or we could get that direct to Tommy as well.
[02:03:44.570 --> 02:03:49.570]  And then we will get you this mystery pack
[02:03:49.710 --> 02:03:53.650]  that he is putting together, which is sure to be fire.
[02:03:53.650 --> 02:03:56.010]  Again, I have a feeling it's gonna be more
[02:03:56.010 --> 02:03:57.290]  than one pack in there, guys.
[02:03:57.890 --> 02:03:59.010]  You can get some slaps,
[02:03:59.010 --> 02:04:00.930]  and I'll get some stuff over to him too.
[02:04:00.930 --> 02:04:03.210]  Let's see here, private message.
[02:04:03.210 --> 02:04:05.250]  Sorry, everybody, peace and love.
[02:04:05.250 --> 02:04:07.810]  This is a major bummer from Tommy Tricomes.
[02:04:07.810 --> 02:04:10.010]  Tommy, I'm glad that you're still watching, dude.
[02:04:10.010 --> 02:04:11.790]  Thank you so much for being here tonight.
[02:04:11.790 --> 02:04:14.890]  Thank you for being such a good sport,
[02:04:14.890 --> 02:04:16.050]  such a good personality,
[02:04:16.050 --> 02:04:17.530]  and being a good member for the community.
[02:04:17.530 --> 02:04:20.330]  Again, a lot of your amazing seed collection
[02:04:20.330 --> 02:04:22.650]  has come through the charity auctions.
[02:04:22.650 --> 02:04:26.010]  And that, again, man, it's more than just getting
[02:04:26.010 --> 02:04:29.330]  cool beans, it's helping some people that really need it.
[02:04:29.330 --> 02:04:32.290]  So you mentioned it earlier, pay it forward.
[02:04:32.290 --> 02:04:33.370]  Bro, you live that.
[02:04:33.370 --> 02:04:36.810]  So thank you very much again for taking time
[02:04:36.810 --> 02:04:38.410]  out of your day to come and do this show
[02:04:38.410 --> 02:04:41.090]  for me and for everybody else tonight.
[02:04:41.090 --> 02:04:46.090]  Now I'm gonna go ahead, I'm gonna type stop into the chat.
[02:04:47.130 --> 02:04:48.290]  I'm just gonna scroll down,
[02:04:48.290 --> 02:04:50.750]  make sure I didn't miss any numbers.
[02:04:51.810 --> 02:04:54.770]  Ooh, I see a person that is one off.
[02:04:54.770 --> 02:04:56.710]  So you're the closest so far.
[02:04:56.710 --> 02:04:59.570]  There's been two off, there's been three off.
[02:05:00.650 --> 02:05:02.570]  You're one off.
[02:05:03.490 --> 02:05:06.610]  I'm just going down until I see me type the word stop
[02:05:06.610 --> 02:05:09.310]  before I declare it official.
[02:05:09.310 --> 02:05:11.610]  And it looks like people are guessing multiple times,
[02:05:11.610 --> 02:05:13.970]  multiple people are, so that's okay.
[02:05:13.970 --> 02:05:16.290]  Never clearly defined it.
[02:05:16.290 --> 02:05:17.650]  Sometimes that's fun too.
[02:05:17.650 --> 02:05:21.070]  Just takes scrolling through numbers a lot longer.
[02:05:21.070 --> 02:05:23.770]  So I'm scrolling, guys, I'm scrolling.
[02:05:23.770 --> 02:05:24.890]  Trying to get that.
[02:05:26.370 --> 02:05:27.290]  But in the meantime, yeah.
[02:05:27.290 --> 02:05:31.690]  So the next C Collector Show is going to be November 16th.
[02:05:31.690 --> 02:05:32.810]  That's a Wednesday.
[02:05:32.810 --> 02:05:34.210]  And also, keep it locked.
[02:05:34.210 --> 02:05:37.530]  We've now have the SCP03 channel.
[02:05:37.530 --> 02:05:40.610]  You're gonna find a lot of Guerrero Grow show over there.
[02:05:40.610 --> 02:05:43.310]  Definitely go check out and hang in that community.
[02:05:44.370 --> 02:05:48.150]  SCP02, got a lot of good programming,
[02:05:48.150 --> 02:05:50.110]  a lot of good shows going there.
[02:05:50.110 --> 02:05:52.870]  And even more recently, we have a lot of,
[02:05:54.690 --> 02:05:57.610]  land race, like grow outs.
[02:05:57.610 --> 02:06:00.930]  So there's a person who's growing out some of these,
[02:06:00.930 --> 02:06:03.490]  exotic strains from far distant lands.
[02:06:03.490 --> 02:06:04.650]  We get to see them grown out.
[02:06:04.650 --> 02:06:06.570]  We get to hear them talking about
[02:06:06.570 --> 02:06:09.210]  what they experienced throughout the grow.
[02:06:09.210 --> 02:06:11.170]  Okay, so yes, everybody.
[02:06:11.170 --> 02:06:12.610]  Cool dude for sure, Tommy.
[02:06:12.610 --> 02:06:14.650]  Yes, Tommy, everybody.
[02:06:14.650 --> 02:06:16.650]  Mad props to you tonight.
[02:06:16.650 --> 02:06:17.890]  Well-deserved.
[02:06:17.890 --> 02:06:21.670]  All right, so I'm gonna call it the winner.
[02:06:21.670 --> 02:06:22.510]  Well, let's see here.
[02:06:22.510 --> 02:06:25.110]  The number was 95.
[02:06:26.430 --> 02:06:31.310]  The winner I have is Jordan95, go figure,
[02:06:31.310 --> 02:06:33.470]  who guessed 96.
[02:06:33.470 --> 02:06:38.470]  So Jordan95, please reach out to me
[02:06:39.190 --> 02:06:42.070]  on the DMs on Instagram,
[02:06:42.070 --> 02:06:45.990]  and get me your contact info,
[02:06:45.990 --> 02:06:47.810]  or safe place to get these.
[02:06:47.850 --> 02:06:52.690]  I will make sure that they get over to Mr. Tommy Tricombs.
[02:06:52.690 --> 02:06:55.310]  And again, yeah, thanks for your time, Tommy.
[02:06:57.730 --> 02:06:59.330]  He's still trying to pop in.
[02:06:59.330 --> 02:07:01.110]  God, this guy has determination.
[02:07:01.110 --> 02:07:04.210]  That's probably why he wins so many seed auctions too.
[02:07:04.210 --> 02:07:07.170]  But yes, Jordan95, he says, I'm here.
[02:07:07.170 --> 02:07:08.090]  Cool brother.
[02:07:08.090 --> 02:07:11.770]  My link, or my Instagram is down in the show notes.
[02:07:11.770 --> 02:07:15.210]  Just hit me up and we'll get you the information,
[02:07:15.210 --> 02:07:17.590]  or get Tommy the information to the right spot.
[02:07:18.310 --> 02:07:23.310]  So sorry about the anticlimactic conclusion there.
[02:07:23.990 --> 02:07:26.070]  We'll probably do some more.
[02:07:26.070 --> 02:07:29.070]  Well, we will do some more giveaways in the future.
[02:07:29.070 --> 02:07:32.550]  But again, that one was courtesy of Mr. Tommy Tricombs.
[02:07:32.550 --> 02:07:37.190]  And thank you again for your time, everybody in chat.
[02:07:37.190 --> 02:07:40.070]  Tommy, much love.
[02:07:40.070 --> 02:07:41.710]  I guess I'll see you next time.
[02:07:41.710 --> 02:07:43.470]  It's weird wrapping it up by yourself.
[02:07:43.470 --> 02:07:47.330]  I feel like I should like sing and dance my way out of here.
[02:07:48.670 --> 02:07:52.870]  So classic joke here.
[02:07:52.870 --> 02:07:54.110]  No, that's too inappropriate.
[02:07:54.110 --> 02:07:54.950]  Not gonna do it.
[02:07:54.950 --> 02:07:56.470]  All right, everybody, you rock.
[02:07:56.470 --> 02:07:57.430]  Peace out.
[02:07:57.430 --> 02:07:58.750]  Have a good night.
