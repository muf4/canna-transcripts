Alright, here we go everyone. We are live and look at those two. Yeah, I know it's
funny. I've been smoking all day since like 6 a.m. when I first started
packing beans and then I started drinking at about 2.30 with the last
show and then I like took a little nap, cooked dinner, and I almost feel like we
we don't eat we wouldn't even have to go on tonight and we'd sell out of all the
seeds. Oh yeah, you know what? I feel the same way but I wanted you know and
what's really interesting is you know a lot of people follow like my education
stuff and they kind of know what I'm doing but nobody's really actually heard
which is pretty freaking crazy so I just thought it would be kind of a fun
thing to kind of like how I got where I'm at. I like storytelling so does that mean
that I can sit back and relax and you'll tell stories? Yeah, that's totally fine.
People have any questions or if you have any questions because I'm sure you will
but you know let's let me start off by first introducing myself for the people
who don't know who I am. My name is Brandon Rust. I'm a professional cannabis
cultivator. I'm the cultivation science director for Majestic Craft Cannabis out
here in Oklahoma. I also own my own farm which is Black Label Organics. I do
consulting for several large facilities over throughout the country and I have a
couple other partners here in Oklahoma. I've been I moved out here to Oklahoma a
year ago but I've been growing cannabis since 2001 on a traditional market in San
Diego where I was born and raised. I had you know I was fortunate enough to work
with some OG some older cats that had been growing since the early 90s and I
got my start that way but before I get into all of that I'm gonna smoke a bong hit.
I liked it. I hit the pipe outside. I'm joined I have a beer with me.
Yeah I got a little bit of whiskey. Yeah we're gonna I'm not I'm not gonna quite
match the whiskey tonight or I'll unless you don't mind me falling asleep. I did
that actually I think I did that with you and Scott or it was him and someone
but he was talking and I fell asleep and then I woke up and I didn't know if it was like 10
seconds later or 20 minutes later but anyway. So I've been growing weed for a long time.
I got a lot of stuff going out here in Oklahoma. I'm really grateful.
So I guess my story kind of starts before me to kind of understand where I come from. You kind of
have to understand my parents. My mom was you know my mom told me a story about
severely beaten unconscious and her stepmother put her in the closet and then
her stepmother actually thought that she had killed her so she lit the house on fire with
my mom locked in the closet when she was young. That's you know that was really the tipping point
I think for my mom is what she had told me and you know she went through a lot of really really
chaotic uh just bad stuff as a as a child and she fled from Illinois to California
where she met my father and my father you know my father's my grandparents they passed away when my
father was around 12 years old. My father had to kind of figure things out on his own and so he
started you know hustling weeds. This is back in the 70s. Really smart guy. He started learning
Spanish. Started going down to Mexico and he was working with uh ended up along with the Mexican
Mafia. He was horsebacking packs of weed back and forth from the Mexican border. He built kind of
like himself up you know on the you know the underground. He was an outlaw. He was a biker.
He wasn't just selling weed you know later on in his career. He was moving huge packs of cocaine
and methamphetamines out uh to the east coast places like Michigan, New York, Chicago and you know
cannabis and like the black market and the outlaw scene they all kind of go hand in hand and they
have for a really long time. Really long time. I mean that's that's just kind of how it went
and uh you know my my father was kind of a badass and what ended up happening was my father was
robbed. Some some kids you know they robbed them. They jumped in his backyard. Beat him pretty bad
with a baseball bat. A couple of dudes broke a couple of his ribs. Ripped off some of his plants
and my dad was the kind of person that wasn't going to let that fly
and he eventually found out who this was and as I tell these stories I want to
kind of first off say that some of the I'm going to change some of the names
of the people involved to protect the guilty because you know just because that's how it is.
Just because that's how it is. Anyway my father uh eventually found out who these people were
and he went and rolled them up with some people that I know that you know became friends later on
that are like my older homies and anyway my dad pulled this kid through a plate glass window
and the glass pierced his stomach and went out through his back
and on the way out my dad loaded his gun and then he shot this kid and that caused like a hole
with what what he had going on. He started wigging out and uh long story short you know a couple
months go by he's you know still tripping on this incident nothing ever happened of it and
you know my dad's still doing his thing. Long story short a couple months go by another
incident happens and my dad ends up shooting and killing somebody his friend actually and
there's a lot that goes to this particular story um that I won't get into now but the reason I'm
telling you a little bit of backstory about my parents is so you can kind of understand where I
came from so like how I grew up. So I was born in 1983 this was the height of Reaganomics and the
drug war and you know my uh my mom coming from so much trauma my father coming from so much trauma
they were you know a match made in heaven right and what ended up happening is I was a byproduct
of them meeting and you know they both had chaotic lives and so I wasn't in my father's life
for the first 18 years of my life and I got taken away from my mom at a young age when I was three
and a half my mom got I think busted with like a half pound of cocaine and so I spent my I spent my
my childhood in foster care and one of the things that happened when I was in one of these foster
homes was I was severely abused not just abused I was I was tortured in these places it caused a
severe amount of trauma as a young child I was beaten I was starved they used to you know whip
me with a belt and they would hang the belt on the wall so I would always it would always be
visual or sexual abuse at this particular foster home this was a kind of a place where
you know they fed off of like it was just an evil place and this is what
they they got money for taking in kids and they abused kids it was a really bad place and this was
you know in the in the mid 80s that this was happening I think this was happening a lot
um they decided that my mom wasn't a fit enough parent but they could put me in a place
where extreme trauma would offend essentially be the uh the outcome the place was shut down
by the sheriff's department later on and what ended up happening was I went to Illinois
but this caused a lot of trauma and I went to Illinois to live with my biological parents
or not my biological parents my biological grandfather and his sister my my uh
and I lived there for a little while and they it was honoring and I had a emotional issues
because of the trauma and the abuse and they you know they didn't know how to take care of me and
they ended up putting me back in foster care which caused more trauma because I felt like I wasn't
good enough or I didn't I thought there was something wrong with me and so I was exposed
to a massive massive amount of trauma as a child and I didn't know how to process my feelings I
didn't know how to process have cohesive relationships with people I was very very
angry I was upset I wanted my mother and I couldn't have her and I didn't understand why
um and it caused you know me to have like night terrors and you know I finally got to a foster
home which was decent it was a lady who had lost her son about a year before and she had two
daughters um and I think she was trying to kind of like fill this void by bringing me into the home
and trying to act from the environment um but it was really chaotic and what ended up happening was
they kind of it was I felt immediate rejection right and so I lived with this type of rejection
for a really long time and on top of the trauma which was which I didn't know how to deal with
I ended up having like night terrors all the time and again this is in the this is I guess in the
kind of later 80s mid mid to late 80s and so they started taking me to a psychiatrist where
again and if you don't know what gaslighting is when people say something's wrong with you
they continue to tell you that tell you that and you kind of start to believe that there's something
wrong with you and it may not be true but if you tell somebody something enough times consistently
they're gonna you know start to believe it at some point and so in the 80s again these you know
I've seen a psychiatrist and they started putting me on all these new medications all these new drugs
that were coming out in the 80s to help with you know uh child there were medications that were for
children right that pharmaceutical companies were pushing on parents essentially and so
I started very young taking a massive amount of pharmaceutical drugs mood stabilizers
antidepressants antipsychotics I was I was diagnosed with so many disorders schizophrenia
just all kinds of stuff right I was you know you name it it was like I had it I had all these things
you know so it caused a lot of issues you know because I didn't feel
you know because I didn't feel anything but angry anger right for a really long time
and you know time went on and I had a very very dysfunctional upbringing I moved around constantly
the lady got more and more foster kids so I lived in a foster home where there was rotating children
in and out sometimes eight or nine kids in one household at a time and that's how I grew up and
it was chaotic it was madness for me especially because the type of person
my foster mother was just single mother and she would always take in the
people who had quote-unquote you know issues you know whether it be psychological issues
emotional trauma physical disabilities those were the types of you know kids that she would bring
into the household and so it was very very chaotic to say the least we moved around a lot
moved to different cities I'm you know maybe 30 different schools growing up I wasn't able to keep
friends when I was about you know I started working pretty young when I was doing like junior referees
and stuff by the time I was I think 14 I started working at Humane Society and that's about when I
started smoking pot and what was interesting about when I first started to consume cannabis
is that I got a new perception it altered my ability to understand what was going on around
it opened up my mind great great like it was it was crazy how I thought about things and then how
I started to begin to think about things and as I started to consume this regularly I became more
rebellious because I was angry not at the fact that well I was angry at all the trauma still I
hadn't dealt with it yet but I was angry at the fact that people consistently told me that something
was wrong with me when honestly I just felt like I thought different or that I felt differently
and being different isn't something that's wrong necessarily at all it's just that it's different
and maybe not as well understood maybe the way I perceive things in the way
I was also you know put in special ed at really young age and I was told that at learning
disabilities later on I was tested my IQ was like 138 and you know they're telling me hey
we don't understand what's going on because his test scores are off off the chart but
he doesn't have the ability to stay focused and keep his attention on what's going on
anyway I started smoking cannabis and it caused a lot of problems to be honest it caused a lot
of problems internally with my uh my foster mother my adopted mom in the family because
it was seen as such a like rebellious like anti-everything type of move you know it was so
frowned upon like you're doing drugs now holy shit and what ended up happening was
I said I don't give a f**k I'm tired of taking the medication I stopped taking the medication
because I was tired of feeling like a f*****g zombie I remember the last medication
pharmaceutical medication I ever took was a medication called Effexor and I remember
taking this medication and being on autopilot and not feeling anything and going through
my days just completely almost unaware of what was going on and I didn't want to be like that
and I was tired of it then cannabis changed that and it changed my reality
caused a lot of problems because I was a teenager I was still in school and
you know all the things that go with that but I started to fall in love with this plant
I started to fall in love with it not for so much the medicinal aspect but because
I started to feel a sense of freedom uh I felt independent in the way that I started to think
and started to feel I was no longer uh I was no longer a kid anymore I was a teenager
and I was no longer being controlled by a pharmaceutical regimen that regulated my emotions
and my thoughts and it was wonderful and it's and not only that but
being able to have a different perspective and a different mentality
allowed me to grow allowed me to look at a lot of the trauma that and psychedelics as well
psychedelics are have been instrumental and extremely important in my own personal
development and growth and dealing with all these different traumas that I've dealt with in the past
because it's not over that's just tip of the iceberg so you know I uh had a lot of
dysfunctionality I graduated high school in 11th grade because I actually got kicked out of the
school district because I just couldn't fucking stand it I fucking hated it I was fucking smarter
than everybody else I and I mean that's what I thought anyway I fucking didn't want the
socialization I didn't want to be there and I just gave everybody the middle finger I ended up
getting kicked out I got expelled from my district and I went into independence they made me go to a
rehab school but it was an independent study school and in three months I wrapped up like
180 credits something stupid I literally did this program and in like four or five months I was
had all my high school credits with the exception of like three credits so I had just turned 17
or I was just about to turn 17 I graduated high school and I was like I moved to a foster
parent's house but I was already getting kicked out constantly from the time I was 15 so I'd be
like on the streets or like couch surfing since I was 15 and I was like hustling to you know smoke
weed whatever and make a little you know side money it was usually just hustling fucking bags of weed
fucking Mexican weed at that and you know I'd be gone for a couple weeks I'd come back be gone by
time I was 17 I was gone I had a job I was working at the bowling alley I was fucking slinging a
little bit of weed I was living with my boy Bodie Mountain Mycology on Instagram one of my oldest
friends from high school he's a mushroom cultivator he does great medicinal pictures and extracts
super awesome dude I lived with him when I was 17 and you know I ended up still not really having
any direction I was selling weed I was into it I loved doing it but I didn't have any direction
but I always like my friends in high school I'm gonna fucking grow weed and blah blah I'm gonna do
hydroponics and I'm gonna do all this stuff and I was telling them all consistently for a long ass
fucking time and you know when I turned 18 I was finally able to get a hold of my mom
right my biological mom because the foster system couldn't keep that information from me anymore
so I got a hold of my mom and I called her up and I was like yo and and here's the thing too I want
to back up a little bit when I was I also you know was fucking up when I was 17 years old because I
did have an apartment I lost all that shit I didn't have any direction I started fucking doing
heroin I was shooting heroin I was fucking 17 years old you know like a fucking idiot like
running around the streets just you know when I got a hold of my mom I got clean you know for a
little while and this would this is going to be constant throughout maybe this story until
some years back use and stuff um I I got a hold of my mom when I was 18 and it was like I called
her and she was in tears and like the next day she drove down to Hollywood and she came posted
up a hotel and we kind of reconnected but the the thing was my mom was strung out you know I knew my
mom was strung out because I had been strung out and I wasn't strung out at that particular time
but I knew it was up you know but I appreciate the fact that she came down to see me because
that's what I had wanted for such a long time right she had some piece of shit boyfriend and
they were just strung out dude and you know and I don't blame her and I still love my mom
um I don't blame her because she had all that trauma that she wasn't able to deal with
my mom gave me my dad's phone number or uh not phone number address and when I was 12 years old
living in the uh my foster home I saw a news uh news cast that came on and it was a man who was
in a green SUV and he was he had just ran through like a police barricade he had hijacked or he had
hijacked the car this dude he had ran through a police barricade he was shooting at the news
helicopters and then they announced his name he said this is Stanley Fennell um my foster mom was
like that's your dad and I was like what so I was 12 years old and I'm watching this news clip
live on air on TV while my dad is like shooting at the cops getting into a shootout on a high
speed chase like the most gnarliest shit that you could fucking see like shit that you see in a
fucking movie right and I'm watching this and I'm like holy fuck dude like
you know so for for for eight years this is in the back of my mind and I fucking meet with my mom
and she tells and it's a fucking crazy story right it's a fucking crazy fucking story and that was a
whole different podcast but anyway my dad has been in prison since 1996 and he used to grow
weed he used to do all this shit he was a fucking biker and he fucking had all these connects and
blah blah blah anyway my mom gave me his address and I hit him up and I was like what's up dude
I'm your fucking kid and blah blah blah blah and I sent him pictures I seen pictures of him
it's like dude we're it's crazy like we almost look like twins when we're like 20 in our 20s
what ended up happening was I'm I I got a hold of my dad you know I told him what was going on I
was like yeah this fucking blah blah blah I've been trying to sell weed and I got no direction
fucking blah blah just gave him the whole run of my life this is what's been fucking
happening he's like you need to go down back to east county san diego's I was living up in north
county and he's like you need to go meet my friends and so I did I fucking packed all my
shit up and I fucking went down to lakeside and I fucking moved into one of his friends house
an older couple that are older than me you know they're in their maybe 40s at the time
you know they're in their maybe 40s at the time and I was like just turned 18 probably
and they were fucking slinging Mexie Mexican weed Mexie brick weed and like I got a fucking
little job down there and they were telling me about like oh you gotta meet this dude
fucking Harry you gotta meet Harry you gotta meet Harry he's the motherfucker
like he'll take you under his wing and I worked at this fucking pool
three or four months waiting for this fucking this house so I could meet him
time went by and eventually fucking came by dude and he's like this dude he was like 28 years old
long hair fucking goatee long ass red hair and he's like walks in all loud you know like
we were smoking weed and he looks at me and he's like holy shit you look just like Stan that's my
that's my dad and you know I my our body gestures and the way we talk and move and everything
really similar so they start these people started to gravitate to me they were like
I'm fucking tripping out you know long story short you know I told him like look I know what
you do because I knew he was the man he was growing weed he'd been growing weed for like
10 years indoor he he's the guy that created the app out in San Diego he's he was doing
fucking big things and with like a lot of fucking OGs down here in San Diego and wanted to be part
of it and I was a fucking kid dude I mean when I was fucking 18 I probably looked like I was 14
years old you know I was a fucking little ass kid dude probably 90 100 pounds soaking wet and
this was like the big homie that I've been waiting to meet and he's like yeah I'll put you to work
and I was like fuck yeah this is it and it wasn't what I thought it was dude that those motherfuckers
him and his partner like they made me basically they tested me they're like if you want to do
what we do we want to see how bad you want it I didn't fucking go into a grow room until after
probably four or five months of fucking weed whacking these dudes yards or washing their dogs
or fucking cleaning out their cars you know the closest I got to eat cut like even coming close
to a plant was dead but cleaning out roots out of hydroton rocks you know like doing all their
fucking dirty work I was basically their bitch you know and but I knew what they were doing and
I wanted it you know and so I just kept doing it and I fucking weed whacked his whole fucking yard
and I did all this fucking stuff and eventually what ended up happening was uh one day they
fucking put a blindfold on me threw me in the back of the SUV and said keep your eyes shut kid and we
went for a ride and you know we went to we went to a grow house which was a a friend of ours
uh we'll call him Ronnie he was actually a federal agent he used to be a gun runner and uh
he was actually the guy who sold the fucking gun to my dad that he used in the fucking
murder which is crazy and he had this house and we fuck it was all decked out and they and I
fucking went in there and this is in like I think this is like 2002 the beginning of 2002 probably
and uh you know I they they brought me in this house and they uh they took the blindfold off
and opened the door and it was a fucking room it was like they had I think the way that they're
doing it was 36 two gallon uh ebb and flow brain buckets under four thousand they had them staggered
with two hps's two metal halides and these motherfuckers were like six feet tall and I
and they opened that door and I looked at there and my fucking eyes lit up and I was like
I fucking made it I made it this is like this is the big leagues it wasn't even a big
little small operation I'd later find out what that was bring me there to work or show me in
there anything they said hey open this galvanized steel conduit with this fucking dremel so we can
steal power and I was like you guys are gonna pay me how much they're like we're gonna pay you two
grand I was like fuck yeah now this was probably to this this time probably the scariest fucking
thing that I had ever done we're talking about a galvanized uh steel pipe with like 175 000 volts
of power this fucking handheld dremel with these little flat discs cutting open this fucking this
fucking pipe so that the electrician go in there with gator clamps and clamp onto these fucking
things so I'm literally sitting there for like six hours man and I'm grinding grinding grinding
pipe down cutting out a fucking a little fucking like little d in the pipe so they can fucking
ratchet open it's funny because my the whole time my heart is racing I got some punk rock music
going just to get me pumped up I'm like I got this dremel and dremels they break they fucking
so they'd fucking get stuck in the fucking metal right or they break dude and oh my god dude my
heart would fucking jump out of my fucking chest because I was like dude one wrong nick dude and I
toast these dudes are gonna fucking wrap me up in a rug and dump me somewhere you know what I mean
it was so intense man and it took me probably about like six or seven hours and I finally got
through it and I didn't fucking kill myself I didn't fucking you know I didn't cut into those
wires or anything it was so crazy right so we get this thing cut open dude and and you know
triple d goes in there he's an electrician he wires it all up and they finish we finish this
house it's you know four bedroom you know 12,000 watts back then you could get rich off 10 lights
you were hitting you know two pounds of light at fucking about five grand a pound so it was just
one of those things where back then you could just crush it yeah all the afghani bull rider and
fucking purple kush back then purple kush the blueberry bull rider the blueberry romulan bunch
of blueberry stuff um and and it was just we were fucking you know that was the start that was the
start of everything for me was cutting open that that that conduit and after that they were like
you're in kid you know and it was funny because they were paying me like an ounce of weed I think
a week is what I was getting paid and I got paid that for probably almost two years but it was
funny because I integrated myself into like like I ended up started selling all of their weed because
I was a young kid and I had access to like people my age that didn't have access to that fucking
fire ass weed right so you know we had this house and then we had what was called the village back
then and this is all in El Cajon in San Diego in the village and if you if you're an og and you
know like the cats from like sprung monkey like will and ernie and fucking steve so those guys are
sprung monk and they used to live in that this village and it's on quia maca in El Cajon right
and it's these like duplex complexes that face each other and every single person in that place
was either growing weed or supplying power to the other neighbors to grow weed so we had two
apartments in this complex and then we had a neighbor in between us that was supplying us
power to both of them and then we had another grower and then across the way we had someone
that was slaying weed and then we were so the whole place was lit up with like different growers and
you know at from a young age I was able to go in there and work in the two apartments and
that whole power with these dudes for like almost two years and so they taught me everything man
I mean I had to do all the bullshit work like uh cleaning all the stuff out and doing all the
bullshit at first but that's like built me up and then they showed me how to mix nutrients
how to maintain you know proper ppm's proper uh ph you know just everything they showed me the
whole ins and outs of the game not only that but I started slaying all their weed for
not all of it but I was slaying weed for them and you know after a little while these guys they were
moving on and I oh cool thing too they got they were partners with other people and I was like
the worker so I got to also work with people that they were working with and some of the people that
they were working with like like boxer for instance was one of the own growers right and
he made our fucking get our fucking grows look like peanuts dude because we'd have like uh like
a 12 lighter you go into his place dude and he'd have like 100 dowies set up like insane it was
just scaled so much bigger than what we were doing like instead of running like the two gallon ebb
and flow buckets dude was doing five gallon ebb and flows his resi's were like you know the 400
galleys well 400 gallons while we were running like 50s he was just so much bigger dude and so
I got to work with him and I got to work with people like him and I got I was selling his weed
I was fucking I started integrating myself with all these different people from a young age
all these ogs right and I'm the and they just I was the kid I was just the fucking kid you know
the kid will fucking get rid of that work you know fucking call the kid he'll help you trim
call the kid you got something that needs to be cleaned up that I was like that was that was what
I did you know so I was really really fortunate to be able to work with all these fucking these
older cats that were showing me the way you know and I'm really appreciative because a lot of people
are still a lot of these dudes are still out there man they're fucking getting their hustle
on they're getting dicked by the system legacy fucking growers motherfuckers that deserve to be
working in legal markets that that aren't you know
what are those guys all still in the San Diego area yeah so I was really fortunate enough to
the guy that taught me
he he's been uh
a uh instrumental in my success for a lot of reasons and when I had an opportunity to start
a farm out here I had an opportunity to do it with myself and the two brothers that owned the property
and the two brothers that owned the property uh for like you know just doing thirds I was like you
know what I will do this with you guys but I'm not gonna do it unless we bring my old partner on
because later on down the road I worked for them but we actually ended up becoming partners you
know or we worked together and he was my last partner before I moved out him he was pissed at
me when I left dude because we had something going you know he's all and he told me when I
moved in there don't fuck me dude and I remember and and I fucking bailed on him and I'm like bro
I'm sorry to do this you know like I have to do this and he was pissed and I was like dude don't
worry it's gonna come back to you and a year later now he's out here and we have a huge that farm that
you see on my IG feed at Russ Brandon he's a part of that and he's been growing since 92 you know he
taught me how to grow now I I do all the science and I know all the stuff but that dude knows
plants that dude's been fucking growing cannabis every single fucking day of his life for almost
the last 30 years same as myself you know other than the times that I've been in prison which
we'll get there too right because I was fucking growing weed for a little while you know I got
my own partners they moved out of that those apartments where all the growers out and I ended
up taking over one of those apartments and then my partner ended up taking over one of those
ended up getting my own partners because I didn't need to I outgrew getting paid three an ounce of
weed and selling their weed you know I knew what I could I knew how to do what they were doing at
this point you know so I said my house houses you know I set up my places with my partners and we
started getting it ourselves and you know I I had met some cats that I was on a weed too and I was
like look dude I know you guys gotta have money because I'm selling the fucking weed to you guys
I was like what's up dude why don't you guys finance this fucking grow dude my boys are about
to move out of these apartments buy all the equipment set it back up and fucking we'll crush
this shit out and they're like yeah well I was like you guys just fund that shit I'll fucking
grow and that's what they did they paid all the bills they bought all the equipment and I was like
and I just got it and we were in these apartments just doing our thing fucking getting paid you know
this was like 2004 and I was doing this shit and I was getting dudes 20 21 years old I was not
fiscally responsible because when you grow up with fucking nothing and you're poor and you eat
fucking hamburger helper for dinner and fucking spaghetti every motherfucking night I mean
grilled cheese sandwiches man there's some stuff like that I just top a ramen motherfucking like
yeah I mean there's plenty of people in the chat that know what I'm talking about you know what I
mean and it's like you when you grow up poor you don't know how to manage money and you're not
fiscally responsible so I was making all this fucking money dude like 15 20 g's a month dude
and I'm fucking wasting it dude I'm fucking you know I'm going out to bars getting limo rides
all over fucking town like dropping like two three grand a night on fucking nothing just
partying just cool because I fucking grow weed I got that total wrong mentality about everything I
was doing back then because I just I just didn't know I didn't know that what I should be focused
on you know it wasn't until I really got heavily into psychedelics
that I kind of happened like and it wouldn't even be later on in life one thing that I should make
about 13 years old I started studying the occult and I started going to the library and reading
about ancient civilizations and about human psychology and everything that you can think
of that goes along with like mysticism and everything else and that plays a really big
part in where my story goes. So I'm growing fucking weed I'm fucking crushing it we're
fucking making a ton of money I'm fucking I learned about blowing BHO in 2003 and it was
the first time I ever learned about it and that was blown wax from PVC pipe and those cheap yellow
cans of butane back then I saw a YouTube video or some shit on it and so I had been experimenting
and I actually blew my I probably one of the first fucking people to blow themselves up luckily it
wasn't a big explosion we had apartments that were right next to each other I had all my pilots shut
off in my apartment but I was at my partner's and I totally forgot where I was because they're
identical and I was fucking in the kitchen blowing some fucking BHO this is like 2003
actually burned myself really really fucking bad and they gave me fucking oxycontin
and that started a whole shit show of of stuff probably and I think this was like 2004
maybe late 2004 maybe early 2005 so I was growing weed and shit I had my own personal
apartment which I was slinging weed out of partying and then on the other side of my apartment was the
grow my partner's grow and I was fucking growing in my house too in the fucking closet and I was
fucking getting I was strung out because I got strung out on oxycontin from being burned so I
was partying all the time I was wasting fucking money being a dumbass and then I met a fucking
girl right this isn't the part where everything gets good either because typically women have a
ability to make things better for some reason but this isn't one of those times
this is one of those times where things appear to be really good
um but get insane and what ends up happening is I I'm in alcohol and there's a place called
the boardwalk which is a bowling alley arcade a bar and I go in there you know I'm drinking or
whatever having a good time and I go in there and I fucking see this girl she's giving me
fucking googly eyes from across the way and I'm with my homeboy and I'm like man that girl keeps
giving me googly eyes and so I'm like you know I'm gonna go say what up and I go say what up to
this I go you know say what up to this this girl she's all about it and blah blah blah long story
short you know we ended up like talking and I exchanged numbers blah blah blah she ends up
becoming my girlfriend she's like 17 I'm like 20 years old at this time um she's about to turn 18
and we start dating and stuff and you know I kind of let her you know what's going on with me I'm a
hot big shot growler a fucking idiot I was back then and uh what ended is a bunch of weird shit
so I started dating this chick and it turned out that she had been like assaulted by some old dude
and then there was this fucking case that she had with the police department
I started I was dating this girl for a long time and this case there was this weird fucking like
case where this chick that I didn't find out later was raped by this dude that she had met
online before she was 18 and there was this huge investigation that was ongoing for months
right and you know after she was 18 we've been dating for I don't know maybe like
finally they like arrested this dude and the officer that did all the reporting and stuff
like this got all buddy buddy with her mom right and like started like following this girl around
and like just kind of like checking up on her I guess about per her mom's request and she was with
me a dude who's fucking growing a fucking ton of weed slanging mad weed like we're my partners
were going up to fucking NorCal and picking up like you know like 50 packs and shit coming down
we're just doing everything that we can and this is the early days we were making a ton of money
we're irresponsible we weren't we weren't really covering our asses as well as we should have been
even though I knew better because back then clandestine operations this is how it is kid
all the OGs told me you know anyway long story short man a lot of crazy ass fucking shit happened
this fucking cop was sending nude photos of himself to like to her and like all this shit I
found all this shit and it turned out that she's that she started fucking this cop while she was
dating me while I'm running these like these like half a million dollar a year grow operations
and you know he had sent her pictures of himself and he's married and like I thought he was giving
her like cocaine and shit like the amount of depth that these stories go into it's insane how it all
plays out long story short dude she started getting strung out on cocaine I wasn't really
into cocaine I was like maybe partake at this time she started getting strung out on cocaine
and this cop was giving it to her and then she started fucking this cop and then
it just turned into this whole world like shit storm this wind shit storm fucking insane right
so this cop had actually sent all these photos to himself on her phone which was actually my phone
because she was on my plan and I had given her the phone and shit so he fucking had called me
one day and I was like mother and I went off because I was like fuck you because I didn't
know what the fuck was going on I was losing my mind I was fucked up on drugs it was a whole
fucking shit show anyway I had these fucking nude photos of this fucking cop on my phone and I was
like you're fucking done dude I'm turning you into internal affairs I know what's going on blah blah
I would say within three three days later my fucking spot got hit every single electronic
device in my house was taken out the phone that I had that gone my computers were gone
every single electric piece of equipment that I owned was fucking gone out of that house
right they fucking raided the place took me into custody you know this was in 2006
I got busted with 256 plants a four-bedroom house and it was you know it was a fucking
and it was I mean I was sitting in fucking in jail these little fuckers are trying to ask me
fucking questions and shit and I'm like I don't know what the fuck you guys are talking about
I need a lawyer so let me give you a piece of advice if you ever get fucking detained at all
the only fucking word that needs to come out of your mouth is lawyer they can legally
pursue questioning or anything if you say that you want a lawyer
so I was running an operation a really big operation it was somebody else's house obviously
I didn't own the place and my partner had kind of backed off he's kind of pulled out
they wanted names and shit I was like fuck you guys and because of that I fucking did a prison
fucking did a prison term because I could have gotten a slap on the wrist in probation or
whatever but fuck that that's just for bitches you know what I mean keep your mouth fucking shut
and and that's how you do it dude we all knew the risks we all know the risk when we do these
things right and that's the whole mentality that we had like I knew that I was fucking breaking
the law like I knew I could go to fucking prison I knew I could get in trouble but that's the risk
you fucking take if you want to fucking play the fucking game you know so part of that is is like
you know the fucking risks you know it goes along with it so you do your time you keep your fucking
mouth shut and the people that that uh they'll look at your back you know when you when you get
out man these are people that are gonna help you you don't burn your motherfucking bridges
so I think that uh that shit fucked me up man mentally and everything had really bad trust
issue with women and um I'm still dealing with that you know I was dealing with that earlier
trauma and then this trauma I'm in fucking prison 16 months on this fucking term I get bussed for
death of electricity because this is the place that I fucking stole power at
that later on I ended up inheriting that operation so I get busted for sales cultivation and theft
of electricity along with probably like 11 other fucking felony charges in like 23 misdemeanors
you know when you take a plea bargain they narrow it down or whatever I would have done
federal time if I hadn't on probation because when I was 18 years old I got fucking narked on
by one of some fucking bitch that got fucking busted and they offered rat on three you get set
free that was like a deal that they were offering people if you rat on three fucking people they'll
let you go again that's a bitch ass shit if you're gonna fucking play the game you have to know that
you can do the time right so I got busted with like five pounds of Mexican weed and I was on
fucking probation which I was on the run from this whole time because I was like fuck probation
and fuck you guys because that was my mentality because I already knew I was growing weed and I
didn't give a shit nobody was going to tell me fucking differently especially not at fucking
20 21 to 22 years old 20 21 22 years old they weren't gonna tell me anything at all
except you want to fucking smoke this yeah sure um I did my fucking prison term kept my mouth
shut I had nothing I mean I had nothing when I went into prison I didn't have no mail no
fucking commissary but one thing that I did have was my dad he had already done he'd already been
in prison since 1996 I didn't even have fucking paperwork when I went in if you go into prison
without paperwork if you don't know that like at least in California there's prison politics
and if you don't if you can't show that you're not like a pedophile if if you fucking beat up
your somebody's grandma or you like there's a code of like honor even criminals and if you do something
fucked up man you're getting fucking taken care of at least if you're white and you're in California
that's just how how it is they they clean they clean out their car just so to speak um so prison
was a place for me and I did not any paperwork at all and I was approached by a guy and he was like
yo you got your paperwork we gotta start we gotta check you just make sure that you're
oh that you're straight I was like nah man this is the first time I heard of it he's like well
you better get your paperwork because if you don't get your paperwork they're gonna fucking stab you
and I was like well fuck how the fuck do I get my paperwork like you need to call your public
defender if you know how public defenders work in the criminal justice system you know that shit
about you they don't have the best interest and they're not really on your time schedule
especially if you're locked up they don't give a shit I was really fortunate I got really fucking
I got really fucking lucky because the guy above me the a skinhead that I had actually met
when I was out on the streets and he knew who my dad was because my dad was a fucking biker and my
dad sold fucking drugs and shit turns out that my dad actually had this dude who was my older
homie but my dad's younger homie like us and had him do a bunch of work for him and at the end of
the day instead of giving him like 80 bucks or 100 bucks he chunked them off with like a g like
a stack like here you go homeboy like you did fucking good I'm gonna hook you up go take this
money and go fucking take care of yourself you know that's how my dad was because that's what
everybody's told me now my communications with my father are through emails and letters because
he's still in prison but I was lucky because this particular person we'll call him uh
Ben um and was a high I guess ranking member of you know a a gang and he held the keys to the yard
in reception and I was lucky enough to talk to him he knew who I was he knew who my dad was and
didn't have to worry about the paperwork I got really lucky gave my time you be respectful
it's not a big deal you do your time keep your mouth shut work out do your routine
you know read play some chess um I got transferred to another prison and the same thing happened
um hey you got paperwork I was like no I don't have paperwork but at this particular
gang member who had the keys and I happen to also know him because I actually sold weed to him
with a boy of mine who is near and dear to my heart my my homeboy rest in peace Dave Rains
he was somebody that we'd with for a really long time and he had done several prison terms he was
one of the guys that like grabbed me and was like this is how it is fucking kid you're gonna fucking
he taught me about respect basically before I ever was in prison before I you know like
he said this is how shit works this is how we get shit done son and he was my OG homeboy he
passed away from hypermeiosis syndrome cannabis hypermeiosis syndrome probably one of the first
cases before I even knew what it was had his name tattooed on my body I love my homeboy and
this was a friend of his that we had dealt with in the past and he cleared my paperwork again
I got lucky twice because of the positions that I had been put in prior
which is going to be important in the future I did my time kept my head down I did 16 months
I got out I did uh I got out 2008 and I went to work and just like I always go to work I
go to work for a little bit with some bullshit ass job this time I worked at target and I worked
at fucking Papa John's pizza my homeboy my homeboy Johnny let me stay at him in his pop's house for
probably like six months while I got on my feet well I saved that money then I got my apartment
parole wasn't tripping back then like you could smoke weed as long as you didn't pop dirty for
fucking speed heroin or cocaine you were good you know you could smoke weed and do your thing so
I chilled out got an apartment started slanging my homies weed you know all the fucking OG heads
they all still doing their thing they ain't nobody stopped doing nothing yet you know
let's get back on the grind and I start slanging weed save up my chips I fucking get off parole
and I fucking start growing weed again you're right but I still really haven't dealt with a lot
of the shit so I'm still fucking up here and there doing snorting oxycontin drinking too much
I hardly ever drink but I had to kind of relax myself because there's a lot of information
I wanted to get out and kind of share so I'm doing my thing I start growing again I got
you know I got things going for me where my old partner says hey I need I need you to fucking
grow here and I need I need your help and I just get back into the routine I get back into growing
again just like I always do and you know I'm doing it I've got you know I've always been growing weed
you know I've always been making money off weed I've always been growing that purple kush I made
fucking I paid my bills for so many fucking years off that purple kush
um when I look back you know I was fucking up a lot you know I didn't have clear direction I
didn't have a plan of what I wanted to do I didn't ever even think cannabis was going to be legal I
didn't think I'd be in a sitting in the position that I am today so things are really chaotic still
you know doing my thing selling weed growing you know I've been you know mishing stuff up too
since 2004 as far as like breeding and stuff goes so I was doing that you know I was doing my thing
and I had a couple of rough spots where I you know was drinking too much and got DUIs
or went to jail I got strung out on heroin went to went to jail I was fucking going down to Mexico
man and smuggling heroin I would bring girls down there and we we got first started out like going
down to bodegas and eventually I you know found out who was doing what and just doing shit like
that you know just fucking up across the board while I'm growing and you know just not having a
clear picture really and uh it's it's kind of it's kind of interesting because when I look back on it
I see that I you know I'm the same person but I'm so different because I didn't I didn't know how to
like process or plan I didn't plan for the future I mean I honestly didn't even think I'd be alive
by the time I was 30 and I'm fucking 37 now you know so it's
I didn't I didn't plan for any of this
um you know I had some really bad relationships I had some good relationships
um I was with a girl for about seven years and we were growing and doing things and built stuff up
right before I actually moved out here to Oklahoma um but I did go to I did another prison term too
back in um 2017 I got busted actually I think in late 2015 because I was making concentrates I'd
been doing it for a long time it started to hit it was one of those things where um I had a lot
of experience with creating butane hash oil and all of a sudden like the market was like demanding
it and I was like dude I can make a shit ton of money on this really really fucking fast because
I already know how to do it um and so I started doing that and I was fucking crushing it I had a
lab set up in my in my house and and circumcised shitty circumstance landlord's kid fucking called
the fucking sheriff's department on on on a fucking neighbor and they showed up at my house
because he wasn't home or he didn't answer his fucking door or some bullshit and they were
suspicious and they ended up coming back like 10 hours later and raiding my my place you know
and that was the second time I did a prison term for cannabis and this time I did 18 months for
fucking manufacturing um and I was fucking I went on the run dude I went on the run for like
14 fucking months or 15 months and the bonds agents couldn't find me I ended up getting
picked up by the U.S. Marshals Fugitive Task Force actually but in that 14 months I started
Bokashi Earthworks well actually I didn't start on my business advisor an older woman who just
loves doing hobbies she had started kind of doing it and she only was like I started this with $300
and I was already using Bokashi and I was already far more advanced into the cannabis cultivation
science and she needed help with some stuff and so I went over there and I helped her and she's
like oh you should be a part of this and I was like oh sure here here's 300 bucks and I started
doing the manufacturing and I started doing this blah blah and I started building it up and then
it completely stopped because I went to fucking prison for 18 months and what's fucked up is I
kind of want to talk a little bit about my last prison because it was different than my first
experience what was about it was my first prison experience I actually went to prison
and went to a prison yard reception then I went to a prison a low-level prison where I would
this time I didn't go to go to a prison I actually had to serve my sentence 18 months
in county custody and this is because of a law that was passed in California
what happened in California is
the prison system the prisons were completely full making a bizarre exit from a flight and because
uh because the prisons were full the state said we're going to release all non-violent
offenders so if it's a drug charge or if it's non-violent we don't we're no longer going to
house these prisoners in California institutions so they start releasing them but because
the state gives each facility around 75,500 per inmate per year it was seen as a loss to some
people so what happened was the sheriff's department the sheriffs also those are our
last line of defense as civilians they're supposed to be the ones protecting our civil rights
our constitutional rights they're not supposed to be the ones that are taking them away
what happened was the sheriff's department decided that it would be better for them to profit off
the people that they were going to release and so they started they they created a a bill
and it made it so you could do state local prison terms and what that equates to is that you can do
up to 10 years of a state prison term in a county jail facility now these county jail facilities
aren't meant to hold people for long term that's the reason why a misdemeanor has a short amount
of time attached to it felonies you go to prison because more adequately
um able to deal with inmates needs different programs rarely exist anymore
rehabilitation is more about institutionalized slave labor than it is rehabilitation especially
uh communist california so what happened was in 18 months in in a facility that is
completely filthy with no state amenities um very little health care
terrible terrible conditions we're talking about maybe uh we're talking about modular units that
are smaller than my greenhouse is probably a third of them maybe 18 feet long by maybe 25 feet
wide and they'll fit maybe 70 people i would say about 25 cots stacked three high in these very
small spaces very shit on the the the the floors from the toilets overflowing bad plumbing uh it's
hot and sticky and nasty it's just it's really fucking bad it's really fucking bad rats you name
it people get sick constantly poor medical attention incompetent staff um incompetent medical staff
the type of people that work in these places the deputies they see these types of conditions
and they don't like working at these places either and so when they go to work they're in a bad mood
they're in a angry place and they a lot of direct that towards people anyway so state local prison
term i ended up having i ended up in george bailey which is a fucking shitty prison
shitty jail san diego has about i don't know nine jail facilities they're really really good at the
logistics of incarceration and i ended up in a place called east mesa which is a work camp and
they do in-house laundry for all the facilities there they do all in-house commissary and they do
all in-house meals i think they serve something like 15 000 meals per day out of the kitchen
there it's all done off of so if you go to a prison jail facility in san diego every aspect
of the facility's maintenance is inmate labor all the aspects of laundry cooking
um it's inmate labor in fact this particular uh jail facility is so set up for institutionalized
slave labor it is the sole resource to be able to make all of the other jail systems function
because they do all of the in-house kitchens they have one of the largest kitchens in southern
california again they feed they can feed 15 000 meals per day and they have that many inmates
and they build bigger and more facilities not only that there's ins there's a federal facilities in
this state facilities it's all located in uh you know east mesa san diego so we're talking about
institutionalized slave labor which i have been in the position to see it firsthand see how it
operates see how it how the logistics are run now we also have a company called pia pia is prison
industry authorities from my understanding is a publicly traded company they do is they outsource
other prison labors where they have bakeries at some places they have office manufacturing
capabilities everything that you could possibly think of for manufacturing is done in prison on
institutionalized slave labor dollars a lot of these products are also recirculated into the
prison system so they have huge bakeries all the pia bread for the sandwiches all the cookies that
they serve all of a lot of the pre-packaged meals or items they come from other prison facilities so
they get them at such a low cost they're able to perpetuate the system with the system itself
one of the things about justice isn't and it's not so much about justice but about economics because
prison allows the economics of you know police forces ceos probation officers and then you have
to take into consideration recidivism so everybody who's incarcerated is has a really high chance
they have a low education income from poor background that you're probably going to get
incarcerated more than once probably going to be continuing factor if you get into the prison system
not just the jail system it's almost a guarantee that they're going to be able to profit off of
your incarceration no matter what your crime is and so it it creates this whole economic entity
that is a huge part of the american system it's huge and it's huge and it has to change i think
oregon did a great job by decriminalizing drugs because that really takes a huge thing out of it
but the thing is i think they might be moving towards something in that aspect i'm not sure yet
um so prison yeah that's a whole s**t i got out of prison um i got out of prison two years ago in
november while i was in prison i was fortunate enough to save a bunch of money i knew i was
going to prison i knew it was just a matter of time and so what i did was i saved up a bunch of
money and i was fortunate enough to have a girlfriend who sent me whatever reading material
and books that i needed so i was able to study a lot catch up on a lot of reading material and i
also made a plan and i started thinking back while i was in prison last time when i was in jail
i started to visualize what i needed to do what my goals were and i started to think about the magic
the occult all the things that i knew existed all these things that have been implemented through
psychedelic experiences through study that were inherently a part of myself
it happened for a very very long time i'm not going to get into some of the uh
metaphysical experiences that i've had without the help of psych meditation and stuff like that
especially um but i started to really think about these things and i really i made a solid decision
that i was going to use the secret like the secret the book or the documentary i was going
to manifest what i wanted and i was tired of being incarcerated i was tired of the people i was being
around and i decided i needed to visualize things that i needed to make a plan then i started doing
kind of spellcraft which is really just writing things down over and over what i want right make
a plan plan of action write it over and over and over that's the first part of manifestation it
comes now it's here on a physical piece of paper what's next you get to a point where it becomes
regular and you do it over and over and over and it becomes natural i came out of of prison with a
book filled with a plan and that plan is all the things that continue to come into fruition and
when i look at you know how i got here i had some help you know big shout out to my my homeboy
swimbait mafia on ig he's family you know they owned a flooring company and right when i got out
of right when i got out they put me to work and i worked with them for about six months
and i was doing the bokashi hitting the bokashi as hard as i could because i knew like i had to
do something i can't sand floors i can't do manual label i can't do this because i'm not
passionate about it i need to be growing weed and then i found out about instagram
in 19 i started hitting it just showing old photos of grows from the past
grows from the past started to try to focus on education on just showing people what i knew
and what ended up happening was it started to grow and my homeboy who
from like that taught me how to grow who could have gotten busted a long time ago with me but
i kept my mouth shut an opportunity he's like hey i need you to fucking take over a spot
and just like before you know i got you dog let's do this went up there cleaned that shit up
started producing started putting i put myself on blast i said fuck it dude this
is got this part of the plan that i wrote down i gotta hit it and i
started to showcase what i was doing on the traditional market back in san diego
and i started taking my flower to conventions and so when people you know i'll share and i just
wanted to share with other people what i knew like with the stuff that i was studying all
what i've been doing for the last six years because you remember i did or i did hyponics
and then i did soil with vertigation salts and i went full organic i've been doing this shit a long
time so i was able to give so many different perspectives so many different insights on so
many different styles of cultivation and once i started kind of sharing my perspectives
and going to these cons with my weed right that's what really did it i went to
i went to a convention in palm springs and frenchie cannoli was there and the people
from sunlight demand and people from majestic craft cannabis which now i'm the science
director of they were all there right and what ended up happening is i showcased some of my weed
and i built a relationship with a bunch of different people i started networking right
because that was part of the plan right network showcases talk about low talk about probiotic
farming talk about all the stuff that i have going on that i'm doing show people like look
this is organic weed like people people sometimes trip out like
you know and they were they were like holy shit this is so great and if there's you know i had
to try to make opportunities for myself to be able to get where i'm at right and so i met some
really cool people and we started talking we started communicating and i just was sharing
my passion and saying hey are you doing this are you doing this and then it came to a point
initially it was like dude we need you out here to check on some stuff then i flew out here to
oklahoma and i was like look you guys have to change everything you're doing and i have i had
enough experience to know like things have to change you have to do it different so you know
i put myself in a position to where you know this company probably would have failed if i wouldn't
come in and i changed everything out i finished out what they were doing i changed everything out
and i just built based off my experience and knowledge and i built you know trying to build
a company with people that aren't from cannabis investors it's it was difficult right because i'm
like i come from a place where like you know if you get robbed you if you're not prepared to go
fucking kick somebody's door in to get your shit back then you ain't getting your shit back
you know what i mean you might as well just you know it's just
a lot of times i think people forget like because we have it so easy now and there's so much
access it wasn't always like that and the motherfuckers that were a lot that were doing
this shit were fucking were gangsters you know what i mean motherfuck gangsters and hustlers
and you know it was just it was just like you know it was just like
like real with it you know what i mean and so
it was just more about making opportunity and trying to put myself in a position where
i'm not expendable you know and i got when i've been hustling i've been following that plan i've
just helped people with other people with the experience that i have and then try to be
relatable you know because i come from a fucked up place you know but i've had to work on myself too
massive growth has come from the use of psychedelics dealing with my demons i have a
fucking amazing girl now i have everything that i could want but because it took so much work
like a lot of work not just like on plants on building a business on building myself
on putting you know on networking on like being okay with my own character flaws and trying to
you know be the best that i can be and then kind of not worrying about
like what other people are thinking or what other people are doing and just doing me
you know making my own lane so to speak i guess
is there any is there any questions or anything or
i i have some questions if i can go first so it seems i mean we we can go on you've
you've touched on like 50 different issues one thing i've noticed is your tenacity
and like consuming like it takes an ability to just sit still and focus and concentrate
to power through super dense like academic research and and it seems like you've been
doing that since you were 13 so can you talk like because i feel like that's what led you
tons of fucked up shit happened and and you could still focus and be like shit's going on all around
me but like i'm 15 and i'm gonna focus on x and like like whether it's learning a skill like like
even learning skills it's like you need to just sit and focus and concentrate and it seems like
you've had that ability throughout your life to just be like i'm gonna learn and master something
it's it's almost like an inherent nature that i have because
i've always had this thing where i felt like if i could figure out the pain
like it would be less you know like i why did this happen to me like as a child being super
angry and going why isn't my mom doing what she can to get me back right that type of mentality
it might not even be that she might be doing everything to decipher my own pain to try to lessen
to try to lessen it is brought me brought me to that point peter because my my trying to understand
was right that i think that was the underlying thing trying to understand what's going on
because i felt like if i could understand maybe i would change the way i felt and that kind of
translated to like why i got into these you know into mysticism and the occult in ancient history
and because i wanted i had a desire to figure out and i couldn't figure out through other channels
and i just i didn't know where else to look and so it was like maybe it's in the hidden maybe it's
in hidden knowledge maybe that's what i'm looking for and it was both in that and in psychedelics
though desire to understand because i was confused i was confused and i'm intelligent i mean
i'm not fucking by any means stupid and when
it almost kind of pains me to not be able to understand if that makes sense so me
even doing that was almost like a a desperate grasp at trying to figure things out
in adolescence if that makes sense
yes and i sorry my my two-year-old is still awake and it's nine it's almost 9 30 at night
and she's insisting i put her to bed so i was like you go upstairs i'll be up in a little bit
um i i think some of the stuff you've talked about and like when you were younger
finding a language to express an understanding of something that's completely fucked up is is like
no one has a language to describe kind of like someone else's narcissist personality disorder
it's just like there's this like dealing with it seems like you've dealt with a lot of other
people's psychological issues and problems and been like like when you're like am i to blame
what about me like what did i do wrong and it's like no you didn't do anything wrong like like
like uh gaslighting right like yeah yeah not even knowing what that is or what it means and
and being like i know something weird's going on i just don't have the vocabulary or the language to
understand it express it articulate it just to myself to articulate it to myself yeah and it's
confusing and so and so you know when you go through trauma and you don't have somebody to
help you kind of get through it right um you don't know how you don't know how to feel about
it you don't have to process those emotions because there's like even if you're really
like at a young age let's take uh like sexual abuse right at a young age that's gonna have a
drastic impact on somebody's psyche and they're not gonna necessarily know how to process it then
and they're not even gonna be able to necessarily know how to process that until way down the line
until they're probably in a functioning adult where they can say oh i under i really understand
this because as a child as an adolescent you can't really understand i mean you can you can
have a grasp on it but a lot of things in my experience they come with the experience of a
thing right and that's one of the things too you know i in no means bring these things to light
i don't want people to feel pity or sorry or anything like that right these are the things
that made me who i am these are the things that i've had to learn to embrace right i would not
have what i have or be where i am without these negative experiences and i see it as a blessing
as well because if you can experience the negative or the evil i feel like you have more
of appreciation for the good no i i agree i mean it's whatever i mean even like when you mentioned
you had a distrust of women i you know in my head i was like it's people like it's not women it's not
men it's not black people white people it's it's people like they're shitty people in the world
they're good people in the world why we kept such tight circles right i didn't deal with a lot
except my older homies the ogs the reason was because i knew they were safe right they'd already
been doing this shit they don't deal in bullshit you know it's only when you gotta venture outside
your circles people that you don't know people you know that there could potentially be an issue
you know and so like having tight circles was a was a huge part of everything you know
i don't know if that's a little off track or not but no no it's i mean it's interesting like you and i
having listened to you talk about where you've come from i can't can't like i'm the youngest of
four kids and for me that was an amazing life like i never dealt with anything like
i had two great parents i have two great parents still they're both still alive and they're my dad's
about to turn 90 my mom's 84 uh i have three older brothers and sisters they're all still
alive they're all happy they're all normal they all have kids like and and actually that like
that's what i want to give my kids is like that that happy idyllic life yeah that's i think i
think ideally every parent's goal is to give their child a little bit more or for them to do better
you know but it's it's weird because a lot of people you know i i grew up in something
completely different you know where it's like you know my mom my biological mom she ended up
overdosing on heroin and she passed away about four years ago
her life was a real tragedy a real life tragedy her fiance finally got her clean
so long and he was such a great guy i love the dude he was so awesome he got her clean
he was happy and she was down here in san diego i got to visit her all the time
and he suddenly passed away like within 24 hours he got sick he was in the hospital 24 hours later
he died and it absolutely destroyed my mother and there wasn't anything that i could do
no and so she you know my mom bought a one-way ticket to la where she was
from because my mom was really in the music scene she used to party with like
lemmy and phil from motorhead and she was a dominatrix so she you know uh she told me some
wild man she used to wrestle verne troyer mini me because he had a wrestling fetish
so my mom was wild you know and she was awesome and she was she was amazing but she was also you
know by the way i i love this is just a little additional color to the story
that she was a dominatrix
oh dude it's you know it's verne troyer it's she was so awesome my my my mom was amazing
but you know she had a really rough life and with all these tragedies compiled one after
one after another and then finally to have her be in a place where she's really happy
i'm in her life and content with everything that's going on and have that completely destroyed
it set her off and she you know she ended up uh she you know she went up to los angeles and od
my father's still in prison he's been in prison since 1996
um interestingly enough they changed the laws in california if you have a life
more than 25 years and you're over the age of 60 you had eligibility for parole it doesn't mean
you're gonna get out it just means you get to go in front of a board um they changed that to 50
my dad's like well over um and he's been he'll have 25 years
next year so there is a possibility and it's really crazy the story because i know people
listening might be like oh well he killed somebody he deserves to stay in there forever
sane fucking story it's crazy it's so it's such an insane story that a little bit like
paranoid telling it because of like the people involved and like the organizations involved
um but the good thing is though he does have maybe a possible opportunity to go in front of board
in a few years and do you guys talk like yeah we talk we talk on um jpeg which is
an app you know what's really funny right now is everybody is uh like switching over all paranoid
about instagram and stuff and all that and it's like dude every fucking digital media that
everything's monitored i mean it goes through fucking quantum d-wave supercomputer
you know nsa google they all have them i mean these things operate at fucking quant on quantum
levels i mean if you don't know what i'm talking about just fucking google fucking quantum d-wave
computers in operation since 2012 and they fucking operate on like
multiple levels of reality it's fucking stupid well it's interesting like i i talked to christian
carter who's in jail in eldorado county and it's through i mean i'm looking at it now it's vend
is like i i mean there's some company that's making money off allowing prisoners to communicate
with the outside world yeah yeah jpeg is what i use uh and it's like they charge you for every
communication stamp it's reviewed if you want to send a picture they charge you for every picture
they charge you i mean it you have to understand this is an industry a huge industry huge how many
people in the chat right now know somebody that's been locked up that's done time well a bunch of
people in the chat at that time so yeah exactly we are like how many fucking people here have been
locked up for fucking grown weed i mean that's fucking crazy dude it's fucking crazy but it's
it's economics that's what it is
no it's the prison industrial complex you have to remember there's all these different complexes
the military industrial complex the media complex the prison industry complex
there's all these giant corporations that work together to fuck us over and have lobbyists
yes oh lobbyists are a good one you know what's real fucked up man so in san diego is
fucked especially for cannabis laws incarceration there was a dude i'm gonna put him on blast
because fuck you robert wagner this dude worked on the san diego planning and commission board
they're the guys that zone and regulate where businesses are allowed to operate right
cannabis was legal in san diego you could get a license well just make a distinction because i know
the city of san diego and the county are very different in their policy
it's because it's a whole shit show and there's regulations for fucking everything
so which ones like this was weed and which ones these people were responsible for basically
allocating which areas of san diego could have what types of business so they zoned like oh this
is agriculture land here in this part of san diego this is industrial this is commercial this is
housing or residential that's what their job was to allocate which areas of san diego county
were going to be allocated for what types of businesses right so in the laws that they had
written was you had to go through this comp you know this business and they had to get
operate they had to give operational permits basically permits for these businesses so
basically immediately yeah fuck yeah so immediately what this dude did right so he's working for this
for this company and he started this um this lobbyist group right uh we're gonna lobby to
change the laws that you all but you're gonna pay me laws uh so we can get um better zoning for
you know business cannabis businesses and blah blah and he started trying to convince all these
fucking people from cannabis growers people that wanted to invest money that oh they should pay him
to lobby because he's a lobbyist to change the laws when they already him and all his friends
already had the fucking power to do it they were the only things keeping people from getting the
businesses they could have gotten their fucking license from the state and from the the the county
that they were operating in but these fucking zoning business zoning fucking people were like
oh yeah we don't allow cannabis businesses in these areas right so he's basically taking money
to say hey we're gonna fucking change laws that we already have uh the ability to change but you
have to pay us to fucking do it like fuck you motherfucker you're trying to get a piece of the
pie that you ain't fucking earned there's more like there's motherfuckers like myself and other
people that have fucking done hard motherfucking time been in fucking race riots and shit because
you you got fucking because you grew a fucking plant you know what i mean like there's a lot
there's dudes that are way older than me that have been doing this way longer than me you know
what i mean that'll put away more work and it's like these fucking motherfuckers are like don't
smoke weed they don't fucking care about weed they just want to fucking figure out a way that
they can try to fucking capitalize off of us so fuck you robert wagner yeah it seemed like there
are a lot of people from san diego watching right now because everybody knew what you were talking
about um can can i the i don't know we're using fictitious names but the dude who took you under
his wing and he was like my first project is for you to cause to saddle up to this like high voltage
wire and uh and get me free power like that dude was not your friend
oh he's my friend now though he's your friend now but but but you get what i'm saying right like he's
like your first job is a life and death job yeah no i mean here's the thing these motherfuckers
didn't know me for shit i was fucking stan's kid but they didn't know me and i worked for him for
maybe three four months fucking what weed whacking their yards cleaning their cars washing their dogs
cars washing their dogs cleaning out fucking hydro buckets washing fucking hydro ton whatever it was
you know we built a relationship they had they had they were like kid but they were also like
fucking make the kid do it you know what i mean but hey it all paid off in the end because i'm
sitting here where i'm at so my uh my two-year-old isn't by the way can you read the uh
can you see the comments i have my phone uh open right here so if i scroll i i could but i haven't
been really paying attention to no no no but but in on your are are you on your computer i'm on my
computer yeah yeah so you see like private chat and comments oh i see yeah i do holy shit this is
game changing so my two-year-old is insisting that i put her to sleep right now yeah so i have
to go upstairs for about five or ten minutes so can you hang out with the chat and why don't you
you just drop something why don't you describe it okay anyways and i'll be back in like
i'll be back when valentina is ready to go to bed okay yeah i can see the chat now so if you guys
have any questions just let me know and i'll do my best to answer them and i'll be back in 10 minutes
so you gotta kill 10 minutes of time all by yourself with i could probably do that i'm gonna smoke
all right i'll be back everyone
okay i guess on to that that drop okay so the uh the war on mids um thanks guys i i you know i
appreciate everybody who's here in the chat doing the live stuff um it wasn't for all you guys you
um it wasn't for all you guys you know and the support that you guys have given me um
i don't i wouldn't be where i'm at so um the tk nl5 or tk times tk nl5 haze
i did a bunch of tk times tk nl5 haze by uh dave aka uh aka being brains on instagram
oh i wish i could get uh my my friend in san diego is neighbors with the hog
i'm hoping keep my eyes crossed i get one of those too
so uh he gave me um he gave me a a bunch of seeds and he also gave me the uh i think a blue
dream times uh tk nl5 haze and i popped a bunch of those seeds at the facility in uh
moore at majestic and what i ended up doing was i searched through a bunch of different phenos
two different rounds
and so
i ran them out i ran a couple i ran a bunch of them out and then i had this one plant that was
just super it just grew better than everything else and i grabbed one of those cuts and um also
the limelight bx if you guys don't already know when i got to majestic
magicicraft cannabis out here in oklahoma they only had one variety
and so what i did was like okay i'm going to do a huge pheno hunt so a bunch of people
including like second generation genetics my name is earl i think uh masonic smoker uh
microbe alchemist makimoto seeds a bunch of people a bunch of people gave me seeds and so i started
running i did a huge pheno hunt and uh jackson mean gene had given me some seeds at the emerald
because we had been talking on ig and stuff what happened was he gave me a a bag of the limelight
bx seeds at emerald cup and i gave him a cut of my limerula number 31 which was was one of the
most terpy ones that i'd hunted at that point and you know we bullshit whatever we traded and i went
on my way and then um uh dave gave me the uh this and i planted i think like 500 plants in in a pheno
hunt at majestic and i pulled out like i think like 220 males or something like that
and the best male hands down in that whole room out of those 220 males was that lime one bx i
wasn't even gonna i wasn't even gonna keep anything any of the males but this plant was just in
beast mode and it had like some of the whitest fattest fucking leaves that i've seen on any plant
in my life and i was like dude this shit is dope so i fucking held on to that shit and it was at
the facility for a while and eventually i took a cut with me and i was like i'm gonna put this in
the backyard during summertime with a bunch of the other elite shit that i have the gg4 cut that i had
the um the gg4 reverse back cross that i made that tk nl5 haze that i got from dave the pheno that i
found that thing was bigger than fucking anything in the in the whole backyard dude i had to keep
fucking snapping the tops because it kept uh branching over the fucking top of the fence and
shit um and i didn't want to like put myself on blast that thing was like it was fucking huge that
was the biggest plant that i had um it did so good outside and it was so frosty too so i took um
i took that i took the dead took the uh lima rilla um i took a couple other things and i pollinated
everything with that male that i had hunted out of those 220 of them and so what i did
was uh crossed all that stuff together and that is basically you know the result of what you're
seeing now um the everybody that's testing out um the the uh tk nl5 haze are mostly getting more
of like like really cush or has like an earthy inset musk um somebody told uh one one person told
me they're getting a lot of nag champa which is really awesome because i like nag champa i'm
running a bunch right now in the greenhouse um and the ones that i ran before
were really nice too they got really really really big um and they grew really fast i wasn't
i wasn't super super impressed on like their vigor as far as like i have some stuff that just
like doesn't have super high nutritional requirements and it seemed like this one was
just like it could just keep eating and eating and eating and it's just gonna keep going going
that's kind of how i felt about this one all right so i'm getting into the uh the comments
all right so i'm getting into the uh the comments here i haven't really looking so hogs bet breath
it was um jim i believe was the uh originator of the hogs oh yeah i'm back we're just you know i
you know what's really interesting is that there are a couple of things that were that we ran way
back like maybe one time which was the cat piss and i only got to see it once and that was super
good and um the hog yeah are you talking about in san diego um and that that cat piss was actually
also the cat piss was what they called um champelli uh like oakland and shit like the
rappers used to rap about that shit the champelli looking cat piss and that and that was a san diego
variety too uh but hogs rest was always super exclusive i actually never even got to grow
hogs breath i only got to smoke hogs breath when i was in high school a couple times
um that fam was from valley center and i have a friend tier one farms on ig who actually made the
fronts that i run the fronts is uh watermelon z kill times mac and um uh he's neighbors with those
with that family uh jim is has passed away but they've preserved the genetics in
indiego but they don't advertise they're not on ig like they're they're old school
so while i was gone did you talk about uh the uh tk
yeah a little bit like i said uh i told him where it came from uh gave him a history on the mail
that's the same mail that i used for everything that um i did this year did you talk about ak
did you talk about ak bean brains i've loved to been able to get him on here he just he's really
hard to get like like not hard to get a hold of but it just he doesn't respond very often so it's
hard to like set dates and stuff he is an old head and he's out in alaska and he you know he was
a neville shoemaker and he has a lot of really old varieties and uh they're legit dude i mean
there's a lot of people in the cannabis community a lot of older dudes and a lot of people in little
hidden places that you wouldn't even know that are like that have been crawling for long
fucking gems you know like here's a here's a
my girlfriend um her mom's boyfriend is is an old head when i say old head he's like you know
grateful dead you know he used to follow the grateful dead and stuff he's been he's been
growing the um 1997 and he still has it you know it's like there's tons of people out there that
have hidden gems dude but they're you have to remember a lot of this shit ain't on the
fucking legal market you know a lot of this stuff is like so exclusive nobody even knows
you know like who these people are where they're where it's coming from you know
tons of people out there like that man all like got hidden gems dude and little home growth they've
been holding ages no and and you know some of what i've tried to do is get some of them to
you know it's like you don't want to push people but be like it'd be awesome if you could tell
your story so like jordan who's the guy in humbled behind uh freak show which isn't really
even what he cares the most like he's known for a freak show but it's not like what he cares about
um yeah but i was like you know it's like what he cares about i was kind of like
younger people need to hear what you care about and that's like the impact you can make on the
world is like your intent as a as a person as a breeder as a grower um well you know i i've come
a long way and um i've come a long way since i've been out here really a bit and i've been able to
successfully integrate myself into the legal market and uh i'm building brands i have a lot
of partners out here i have my own farm out here and i think that grow or all organically um
you know obviously certification i hopped on the conversation earlier with uh
all the people on earlier about the blunt mat systems and stuff and you know we're
we're looking to scale you know and and i've i feel like
i want to be able to share it mostly because
like things have to change things have to change because we can't sustain
like we can't sustain ourselves population wise or uh if we don't change
if we don't change i see and have been seeing for a really long time the
has been talked about for a really long time you know when you start running out of natural
resources and uh when there's too much you know when there's overpopulation and when
people don't have healthy habits as far as eating and exercise and you see the world change very
very rapidly in a native direction um also i guess that goes along with
you know a little push for some really narcissistic people
people um starting with the very basics because there's a saying in the occult as above so below
from within from without and what that translates is that the the things in in nature mirror each
other you can't have homeostasis within one system if something that regulates it is out of balance
and out of balance therefore we have to take a stand we have to take an approach
um to the way that we farm because i think that's the biggest detriment to the planet
not just because of the way that we farm but what we put into our bodies
as far as the the density of the nutrition how much food is actually in our food
and i think that this basic change can lead to a greater consciousness
because cannabis is such a high value dollar crop people who can concepts that are backed by science
in these high value crops have the ability to drive and steer conventional agriculture
because when you have a super high value crop you have people are looking at what you're doing
and if you're doing it really really well they want to know how
and why and what's the secret to your success
so my biggest challenge and something i'm going to continue to do is i'm going to
continue to grow the way that i do because i want people to not only follow in the
production of cannabis but i want it to spread to conventional farming
one of the thing that kind of bothers me about the way that we do things is the labels
you know biodynamic or regenerative or knf or conventional right most people
in the rest of the world farming is natural farming utilizing the things that you have
around you to maximize their efficiencies that's farming it's just called farming
it's there's no secret to it it's people have been doing it for thousands of years
of years and it's only been maybe the last 75 80 years that it's
and as far as i know it's a byproduct of world war one nitrites that they used for bombs
right and they found out hey these things make things grow it's like agricultural gas lighting
where it's like no the shit you've always done that won't work in the future like you need this
other stuff yeah and that's the thing it's farming has been farming for the beginning of farming
okay using using cattle to graze on and then utilizing their waste that's
biodynamic but we don't need to call it that it's just farming
you do these things because it increases soil fertility
so obviously now with the populations like my farm for instance the soil that i have right now
i could grow some crops
probably not especially not with the well water it would have to be you know
something would have to be done but a little bit of time a little bit of effort in a couple of years
i can basically turn this dirt into a very very healthy vibrant live soil it shouldn't take too long
and with the amount of humidity and moisture that we get here in oklahoma in the area
i shouldn't really need to worry about
you know half i should be able to have crops that are sustainable because the water holds
an amount of moisture even in summertime when it's hot you know because my son isn't directly
exposed because i have benefiters because i have a microclimate between the the soil
and everything else you know because i have beneficial microbes that we're using and we've
built soil fertility and health it takes a little bit of if you if you do it you know the benefits
are are greater i i think so often in agriculture when we're talking about production
we consistently think about yield how much is it going to produce but the quality oftentimes
is more important because you don't need as much you don't need to eat as much food if it's nutrient
dense you know if you eat a bunch of bullshit all the time then yeah you're gonna have to eat more
of it to even get what you need i want to know look i'll be the first to admit i care i treat
my plants better than i treat my body my plants get more healthy inputs more everything than i
do and it's something we work on it's like the shoemaker's kids like who have shitty shoes
or the mechanic who who drives a fucking beater right you know and it's like
so what do we have to do we need to focus on i think a lot of it has to do with i know it has
to do with we eat fucking trash constantly i eat trash constantly i try not to but even when you
you're eating healthier are you really really eating highly nutritionally dense food are you
really like and then how do you test for that there's no leaf tissue test that i can send
into logan labs for you know for for people to see where my levels are at to see if i'm on point
you know what i mean like where are those levels that like today your own sap analysis
you know that's the thing so kind of coming up with the best way to
to do things may not necessarily mean highest yields but i think higher nutritional quality
making sure that you can consistently have soil that's healthy you know i think those
are going to change our bodies you're new look at here's here's a here's a good analogy
i can have a pretty decent crop and a pretty decent yield good terpene profile good cannabinoid
profile even if my soil is off balance maybe my sodium's too high maybe uh
maybe my ph is a little too low but you know i got a decent amount of soil volume and
it's it's kind of working out right things might have faded out prematurely and i might have not
gotten the yield i wanted but overall you know i'm still getting top top quality so take an
instance take this analogy just because you see that it's functional doesn't mean it's at its best
let's say you just alter something slight you know and you start to create balance
you end up with even better quality even higher yield even you know and we're not just talking
i'm not just talking about cannabis i'm talking about
i'm talking about
in general everything in life like if you it applies you know these things apply
they're translatable i guess you could say i agree hold on let me well so as someone who's going
from like
small scale to medium scale and then you want to go to large scale like
what are you seeing that translates because what one of the things
i feel like in
the world we live in there are all these religions it's like my religion and my dogma is knf
i'm jedam i'm living soil i'm yeah you know whatever and like we agree on 98% of everything
and on the 2% that we don't agree on we're gonna tear the shit out of each other and meanwhile like
it's like all these people who are on the spectrum of agriculture from like
large-scale monocropping over here with you know synthetic based fertilizers like which
is what's going on in modern us industrial agriculture to like you know over here is
the people who want to like breed like the micro breeding crew and in the micro breeding crew
there's jedam there's like the jedam people think that the knf people are all rich people
are all rich people who don't care about like poor people and local inputs and then the knf people
and the living soil people have a beef with each other and then like
everybody has to realize that everybody is at a different point in their journey
that's part of it because i think a lot of times people forget that this is like
this actually like this is for something i think people often lose sight of the
purpose because you have to create it yourself or you could be lost
that being said we can all work together because the ultimate goal
is what we have to achieve right so let's align ourselves with a technique or this or that let's
align ourselves with an ultimate goal let's align ourselves with that we would all like to be free
we would all like to be happy and that we would all like to participate in the type of systems
that allow us to continue functioning
where
you know there's not
not conflict as far as the ultimate goal right i know that look i have friends who
i have friends who use synthetics and their ultimate goal is to feed their family at the
end of the day right and that's fine
but a lot of times
you have to see that there's like an even bigger picture too right because
how like how are things going to keep going i see things that i see things from a perspective
in cycles my plants live and die live and die i see like the same thing in like the way humanity
has advanced and then come you know the dark ages you look out throughout history you know and it's
if we can all agree that we want to like be able to sustain what we have so that we can live
i mean i i think that's pretty good goal i think that's something we could probably all
get behind regardless of like ethnicity race religion creed political affiliation
because all that other stuff is non-existent if like you know we self-destruct which has happened
before it's written you just have to look at history it's pretty like apparent
yeah i think just for me it's interesting that
again i it's like 200 the spectrum and and the end over here are people who like care about the earth
and you know all have like we all understand it's the microbes that feed the plant that
you know we need to nurture the microbes but there's so much infighting and that's kind of
what bums me out and it's like a lot of what i try to focus on is like where are you all
where do you all have commonalities and where do you all like it's okay to diverge and have
differences of opinions but it's like can we define where certain people on let's say the
living soil side of the equation have differences of opinions and talk about them and and and and
well if we're talking about things like that
i mean those are kind of
it depends on i get look it's i guess it's kind of hard a hard one because
there are there's there's science to back up different studies but it's hard to translate
a lot of science over to you know growing cannabis let's say in a modified growing mix organically
right it's a certain type of science a certain way would have to be performed
to get like those types of specific results just to specifically say that you know having the right
just to specifically say that you know having the right biology and you're gonna be okay
it's it's not accurate you know um it's i'm i mean i guess it's there's gonna be a people's
are gonna have different opinions and views on things so there's no no way to go around it but
i mean i guess really just it comes to who are the people are like actually producing i guess like
how are they doing it how successful are they are they successful you know i mean
because i know for me like conversation earlier and they were talking about if you turn all your
amendments they alter things are basically into worm castings because you have so much
worms in there like the amount of minerals that you would have in gypsum and calcium that you
would have oils to you know make them viable you know to be able to actually grow because
and that's a byproduct of you know that's a byproduct of both microbiology and earthworms
you know micro uh fauna you know i think that balance is really the key to
you know that's why i have the yin and yang and bokashi earthworks
because it's all about balance i think you can go overboard with too much of one thing and
how it is in a lot of things
so in terms of your personal scaling up of a grow operation like what are
what are some scale challenges you've hit and or blood or blown through to your surprise well
so first working with people who aren't from cannabis can be difficult especially if it's not
like you like gotta get approval for everything for things to get done that can be a hindrance
for things to get done that can be a hindrance because sometimes you just need things and like
dude we need this or like we should add this um that was the biggest um other than that i haven't
really changed anything that i'm doing um i like my cultivation style is really the same um the
only thing that i'm doing differently is i got rid of doing all the bullshit by testing soil
um like compost teas such a fucking waste of time such a headache people are gonna hate me for saying
it people are gonna disagree with me but it is so nice and don't get me wrong for like smaller
small stuff in like home like things that you know you're gonna need like if you know you can mix up
a compost tea and you know it's gonna have an effect get it done but when you're talking about
trying to brew stuff at scale and trying to apply compost teas at scale and it just it's it's more
hassle than anything and then to find out that hey this you're not even gonna get and then
i mean you could take a guess you could kind of do some microscope work
you know take a kind of but knowing exactly what your mineral content is how it falls into solution
um you just base your amendments off there i've already top dress i've been top dressing for
since i started doing organics so now i just know exactly how much to top dress and uh
and uh if i need to top dress at all that's the only difference it's like hardly really have to
feed the plant i mean and when we're talking about adding minerals especially nutrients the amount
that we're actually adding into like a yard of soil is so fucking minute that like you can't even
top dress it in we're talking about teaspoons like oh this needs two teaspoons of this for
uh you know four yards of soil
why i have two questions one is uh from the last conversation you had said uh you like to push
calcium early and potassium late right and then in general like how do how does a human control
himself from wanting to add too much of everything well that's why leaf tissue testing comes in handy
that's the variety uh to see
what your soil test is right you get your soil test your saturated paste test then you leave
tissue test on your variety you can see how much of what you have uh in the tissue itself
if you can front load calcium which seems to me to bring on the the fastest uh the fastest onset
of flowering plus the closest node spacing calcium i mean it brings everything up with it
uh in solution all those uh all those cations
and you know it gets a really healthy start and and what do you like his sources of calcium
gypsum is great that's like mostly what i mean that they were talking about earlier the
surges buying big ass bags of gypsum yeah i mean i dude i paid like 14 for a 50 pound bag
so it's super fucking cheap you can push calcium pretty high um so we do that push calcium and
veggies is what i'm trying to do i use the amino acid nitrogen so my soil could completely be
deprived of nitrogen there can be no nitrogen conversion going on at all which is almost kind
of i which could almost be ideal i have to do some experimenting on my own here uh not at a
facility obviously because i can't afford to do that uh but what it seems like is if you can control
the uh the nitrogen and i use amino acid nitrogen and if you look at a recent post from the soil
doctor he just talked about it this is a conversation that me and him have had
in the past a bunch i talk about conserving energy in plants and how how i've been using
the amino acids because they that plant doesn't have to expend metabolic energy to convert those
into proteins and so one of it's it's if you can uh use the amino acids in solution to put into your
water and water those in they're immediately available the plant up up takes them and the biology
and the soil uses them they chelate other uh minerals and make them more bioavailable
uh and so and you're conserving energy so if you can do that with these types of soils i think that
it might be a better way to also decrease like pathogen um
virulence right uh violence the rate because these different microbes require a certain uh nitrogen to
uh carbon ratio that they feed off of and they can feed off of the nitrogen that's in the plant
tissue itself that hasn't been converted into the protein here when bryant was talking about
molybdenum and the different enzymes that they use to help convert that nitrogen into those proteins
if you already have the protein there that's why it's kind of like a hack an energy saving hack
if you have those proteins already in there there's no excess nitrogen for pathogens to feed on
so that's one and then also you know when we when uh we front load that calcium
it really in the tissue so that way you can so that way you can really hit that potassium
harder one of the things in organic production is the fact that potassium is one of the hardest
minerals to become bioavailable it has to be reduced in that's available to the plant
usually caught up in mineral form and biologically it can be converted but if you use something like
agsil for instance that's my go-to it's a lot more expensive it's but the quality of the input
is so much higher because you get to add a benefit of the silica but you can put that
into solution right you can agitate that in your water and then you can water that in so it's
immediately available in solution as it's going through that system and that's one of the way that
you can kind of load up that uh that for for that that you know a hard onset a flowering
right um someone asked do you see that yeah so it that's the whole thing that's so that's the
interaction right that's why we're front loading calcium in veg first so it gets a real high
so it gets a real high that way you can start to slowly decrease increase your potassium because
they do have a relationship and they're not necessarily conducive to each other but
if you stack one if you stack something on top it's gonna you know the one that has more is
gonna be available calcium you're gonna need calcium regardless in the fact you know the
plants are eating more calcium they can always use more calcium they can always use more gypsum
it seems like i'm i would be fully like when i do start manufacturing my soil for bokashi earthworks
i'm probably going to be at like seven eight percent of that is actually going to be gypsum
because you can it doesn't really seem to like have a negative effect and it seems like
it has a positive effect sodium so so it doesn't lock something else out
less sodium antagonism less chloride antagonism again though you could put that agsil 16 in
solution right that calcium that act that the the calcium the gypsum is gonna stay stable in soil
right so you can run that potassium through the roots are going to get it immediately it's in
solution so even if it what you gotta wait after it's done it eats it it's you know whatever it's
dissipated the calcium's still there the the gypsum is still there in the soil and so it's
going to follow the solution with the potassium's going to be greater because you put that actually
in the soldering i'm looking at the uh
we could go in a soil science direction or you know what it's getting late so yeah i agree so
so i so what i was gonna say is without even really talking about it uh we have 50
uh so we started with 250 and we have 50 tk crossed with tk nl5 haze crossed so
the tk crossed with tk nl5 haze that was all ak bean brains
he he gave me a bunch of seeds to run through to test them out
uh you know give them feedback and stuff and uh i ended up finding something that just was really
really nice i i didn't i wasn't gonna run it for uh commercial uh just because it took
a little longer than i wanted it it was like you know i kind of like trying to max out my
varieties at like nine weeks for commercial production so when you're going into 10 or 11
it's like yeah as much as i'd love to be able to run stuff like that i just can't um especially
when it's not my facility my farm i'm gonna be running all kinds of crazy stuff dude i'm thinking
about throwing some highland tie in some pots and then after everything's harvested in the greenhouse
just moving it to the other greenhouse and let it you know keep going um but so yeah i came from ak
bean braids great great pheno man i uh i had them in earth pot i actually did earth pots in my
backyard so i had them in five gallon fabric pots and then i dug out these big ass pots in my
backyard put some uh good soil and planted them in there and they were dude they took off so fast
that that one but that i kept because i wanted to preserve it because it's pretty ambiguous and it
it grew oh grew so fast like i hadn't really had a i've never had an outdoor plant grow so fast
all right well should we so it's 12 it's 12 30 at night for you it is all right well we'll let you
get to bed because i also would like to get to bed yeah and um we can definitely do some soil
science stuff i've like literally i like let me just show you guys real quick i have i i go through
a ton of white paper i print them out and there's so much the things that nobody's talking about
that i feel like i can really kind of build upon um is energy conservation in plants and
talking about like actually how the plant can save metabolic energy energy from other sources
other than photosynthesis like the through like conversion by by conserving energy so
i want to talk a lot about now on some future shows we can definitely do that
um yeah no i thought it would be cool and uh our black soldier fly who's this
whoop that's me right there uh what i thought would be cool is if we could reach out to some
of the people who did the research and get them on and then we could talk to them and
because i feel like for those people it's like we found a research fascinating and i turn like
four crops a season what's up i got some things i want to ask you like i i
they're psyched to hear like and all the people watching right now like
it's kind of cool if you did research on like plant and soil science and people are
into what you're researching well that's the thing here so um not all of it is translatable so
being able to translate to practical application is really the difficult part
but what i'm seeing is that a lot of things that are really really standard across farming
work really well in cannabis trichoderma bacillus subtilis obviously you know the
uh pathogenic fungi that uh kill off insects like buvaria bacillus you know uh bacillus
therigen this is a secondary metabolite that kills you know cut worms and caterpillars and
stuff like that using just the simple biologicals that have been around for a long time that are
used everywhere in the world and the pretty broad spectrum seem to work really really well
and then also the probiotics the different types of uh uh you know non-bacteria and different types
of yeast uh seem to actually be more effective in these systems than a lot of the products that
have been commonly pushed on you know the home grower or the cannabis farmer you know things like
you know azo bacteria azo and mycos and just stuff that you know really would have
more detriment on your pocketbook than actual effect that you would get out of the garden
and so being able to like show people hey this is like how it is you can do these things real cheap
look my input costs at the farms that i that i'm both partnered with consult with and own uh
it's so fucking more on bio controls like beneficial mites and stuff like that
all right well with that let's let's call it a night thank i just want to thank uh
join that was in the chat uh in and out regardless uh i i appreciate the community
and again peter i appreciate you having the platform for in and for being able to bring
being able to bring people together to uh you know knock each other's ideas around and
again there's there's not one way to skin a cat so just because i do things a certain way
doesn't mean i like condole methods everybody everybody can participate
um you know i just like to try to i'm i want to you know kind of spread a message you know because
no and i i like people who are constantly open to learning and don't think that they know
the way to do things and like you're one of those people like i you know those those papers they're
going to influence your future direction you're going to try shit you're going to be willing to
you know not fail at scale but like test things proof is in the pudding and it really is and the
thing is um i'm gonna be learning forever uh i the if i'm not then i'm fucking up and i'll know
if i'm not learning something then i should probably reevaluate my position because uh
there's a lot of knowledge still to be gained and given
that's true with that said i'll talk to everybody later thanks for everybody coming in and thanks
again peter and everyone have a uh if we don't see you before then have a merry christmas
happy hanukkah happy new year well let's see you before new year but anyway christmas is
with today's date the 22nd three days away i got two little girls who are waiting for santa claus so
and i'm all alone fred just left me all right thanks everyone uh have a good night and uh
we will see you soon and thank god brandon has to fulfill all the brandon orders uh
but everybody waiting for other stuff i'm uh almost done so
anyway have a good night
