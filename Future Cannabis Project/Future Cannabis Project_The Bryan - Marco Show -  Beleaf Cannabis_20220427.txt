[00:00.000 --> 00:06.240]  There we go the wheels have spun and we are live back on another wonderful
[00:06.240 --> 00:10.860]  Wednesday. Thank you everybody in chat for hanging out, everybody commenting
[00:10.860 --> 00:14.960]  after watching the replay. I'm just gonna jump in here and say I'm super stoked
[00:14.960 --> 00:20.280]  today. I wore the t-shirt of the band I'm going to see. The t-shirt of the band I'm
[00:20.280 --> 00:32.760]  gonna see. So that's how stoked I am. Thank you. Yep and I'm gonna go ahead and dip up into the
[00:32.760 --> 00:35.960]  background. B-Leaf I don't know if you're able just to turn up the volume or maybe
[00:35.960 --> 00:41.000]  move the mic a little bit closer so we can hear you better but we'll be rocking.
[00:41.000 --> 00:46.280]  Let me turn it over to the hosts here. I appreciate it. Yeah happy Wednesday to
[00:46.280 --> 00:51.520]  you Living Soil Nerds and obviously for this show a lot of the genetics
[00:51.520 --> 00:57.400]  nerds are out for this one. You know Marco and myself we are coming back
[00:57.400 --> 01:02.520]  fresh from the National Cannabis Festival in DC and of all the
[01:02.520 --> 01:06.320]  genetics that were out there Marco and I were kind of talking but you know
[01:06.320 --> 01:11.040]  beforehand he chose your genetics B-Leaf to enter into that to that.
[01:11.040 --> 01:16.000]  And so I think that speaks volumes. I know Chad is currently growing your
[01:16.000 --> 01:20.360]  genetics. A variety of my peers have always kind of been talking about you at
[01:20.360 --> 01:24.000]  least these last few years have always been talking about you. And that's really
[01:24.000 --> 01:27.240]  nice to see man because there's so many people out there that kind of come up
[01:27.240 --> 01:30.960]  more individuals are talking about them and then when you're really hanging out
[01:30.960 --> 01:34.760]  with them in the nitty-gritty not on Instagram but just face to face that's
[01:34.760 --> 01:38.560]  where the real truth comes out. And the cool thing about B-Leaf is that when you
[01:38.560 --> 01:42.640]  do find out people are raving about your stuff. You know the National Cannabis
[01:42.640 --> 01:47.920]  Festival was proud enough I guess to show Marco's work on all of their
[01:47.920 --> 01:53.240]  flyers and marketing and that but kind of snubbed him when it came down to you
[01:53.240 --> 01:58.040]  know the final act. And you know kind of thinking about that over these last few
[01:58.040 --> 02:03.640]  weeks I think it or last few days I think it's a part of that is it's got to
[02:03.640 --> 02:08.360]  be pretty hard for any commercial side of things to admit that the home
[02:08.360 --> 02:12.040]  farmers out there if they have the genetics and the skill set can compete
[02:12.160 --> 02:17.160]  with the you know the high-end commercial farmers. And so I wanted to
[02:17.160 --> 02:20.600]  kind of like let Marco talk but there's a reason why he chose your genetics you
[02:20.600 --> 02:25.800]  know we flew all the way to DC. Shout out to JB and Chris had a great
[02:25.800 --> 02:29.680]  time with you boys. I was just able to chop it up with four dudes with no drama
[02:29.680 --> 02:34.960]  it's actually kind of rare now I mean that's how it used to be but now again
[02:34.960 --> 02:40.480]  you know there's always some bullshit going on. So not one one little thing so just hats off to
[02:40.480 --> 02:44.400]  your boys Marco you know graciously accepting me and let me hang out with
[02:44.400 --> 02:49.200]  you guys. I want to let you kind of chop it up man and we'll get into it. Yeah
[02:49.200 --> 02:53.320]  definitely man this is gonna be a great show thank you belief always for being
[02:53.320 --> 03:01.360]  on the show man much respect. Yeah and I did a boom for my brother. I want to give him the respect.
[03:01.360 --> 03:09.800]  Get the vibe right, get the mood right here. Yeah man so um yeah definitely brother I had a few
[03:09.800 --> 03:13.000]  choices you know I've been rocking with you for a little bit now so I went with
[03:13.000 --> 03:18.400]  the one with definitely one of your prize genetics which you're a part of
[03:18.400 --> 03:24.760]  which is that white truffle that gorilla butter cross you know and she was
[03:24.760 --> 03:29.400]  beautiful man we you know I felt like I took her as far as you know she needed
[03:29.400 --> 03:35.680]  to go. It was a kind of a last-minute contest. She did her job she's still
[03:35.680 --> 03:41.680]  wonderful she's amazing. So just so happened that it didn't get the W but
[03:41.680 --> 03:46.360]  that's okay man that plant that you see over my shoulder is a winner man and a
[03:46.360 --> 03:51.200]  lot of people hit me well how did the why is this stuff so frosty why this why
[03:51.200 --> 03:56.520]  that I said it's it's in the plant man it's like not any kind of juice we're
[03:56.520 --> 04:00.760]  putting on this thing you know what I mean I rock all natural farming all
[04:00.760 --> 04:05.520]  natural inputs and you can just see the amount of you know just beautiful love
[04:05.520 --> 04:09.160]  and frost on this plant brother so without getting too much into that man
[04:09.160 --> 04:11.880]  if you want to just introduce yourself tell just a quick little bit about
[04:11.880 --> 04:15.680]  yourself to the family out here I know everybody knows who you are and then
[04:15.680 --> 04:19.800]  we'll just kind of keep digging into it man yeah love and respect Mark I
[04:19.800 --> 04:24.840]  appreciate the vibes on that plant looks gorgeous excellent excellent work brother
[04:24.840 --> 04:33.160]  looks sexy she was stinky too right like yes very stinky I'm addicted to white
[04:33.160 --> 04:39.360]  truffle just smelling her all the time it's just my thing that's my girl has
[04:39.360 --> 04:44.080]  been for a while chimera is nice too but yeah anyways just a quick introduction
[04:44.080 --> 04:49.920]  yeah I believe cannabis we've been driving growing for about 33 years and
[04:49.920 --> 04:55.280]  ever since the black market now we've got a lot of licensed facilities out
[04:55.280 --> 05:00.840]  here in Oklahoma we're doing very large phenol hunts we're doing breeding work a
[05:00.840 --> 05:06.520]  lot of cultivation of flowers we're making rosin and we got some next-level
[05:06.520 --> 05:09.440]  things that we're gonna be working on that I'll be talking about real soon as
[05:09.440 --> 05:16.840]  well very nice well one of the main questions that people ask me when we had
[05:16.840 --> 05:21.600]  you on before is they want to know kind of your selection process if there's a
[05:21.600 --> 05:28.320]  Columbine for cannabis it seems like you have the eye to pick you know top-level
[05:28.520 --> 05:34.040]  talent so you know if you could kind of maybe go deeper into your process and
[05:34.040 --> 05:37.800]  you're in more I think for especially for the advanced guys your thinking
[05:37.800 --> 05:44.280]  process when you're when you're kind of making your decisions so that's a great
[05:44.280 --> 05:50.040]  question bro so for the selection in the phenol process I have a 27 point
[05:50.040 --> 05:57.760]  checklist that I use so it's I give a total score of up to 100 points for each
[05:57.760 --> 06:04.360]  of those 27 characteristics and then the total maximum would be 2,700 be the
[06:04.360 --> 06:11.680]  top score that any plant or could get so so for example one of those 27
[06:11.680 --> 06:16.920]  characteristics would obviously be vegetative vigor right how how quick
[06:16.920 --> 06:23.360]  does she grow fast does she grow etc how strong you know and solid is she in
[06:23.360 --> 06:30.880]  veg so we'll give it a score from 0 to 100 you know 100 is like the fastest
[06:30.880 --> 06:34.520]  plant you've ever seen and you know 0 you know be something that's probably
[06:34.520 --> 06:39.200]  not going to be even going into flower because it's too slow so then you know
[06:39.200 --> 06:43.440]  over the process of the phenol hunt I have a spreadsheet and I keep logging in
[06:43.440 --> 06:48.480]  numbers and I'm observing the plants throughout the phenol hunt process so
[06:48.480 --> 06:52.800]  some of those numbers can be determined early on you know like the vegetative
[06:52.800 --> 06:56.080]  vigor for example and then some of those numbers the last ones we're
[06:56.080 --> 07:01.720]  looking for obviously the smoke test or the the THC test or the trip test
[07:01.720 --> 07:06.960]  whatever the CBN or CBG whatever is we're looking for can come out at the end
[07:06.960 --> 07:11.480]  and those are the last components or characteristics that we'd be finding so
[07:11.480 --> 07:17.360]  the selection process is a lot more scientific in nature but there's
[07:17.360 --> 07:22.760]  obviously as growers you know the plants talk to us so you can start to see it
[07:22.760 --> 07:28.160]  and feel that vibe of a special plan it has like a special energy it seems early
[07:28.160 --> 07:33.800]  on even in in veg you can start you know I've done many times we've taken plants
[07:33.800 --> 07:37.120]  and veg and so you know that one just seems like it's going to be when not
[07:37.120 --> 07:42.640]  only she big and aggressive and great branching but she just has this aura you
[07:42.640 --> 07:46.960]  know to her sometimes it's not right but usually you know three-quarters of the
[07:46.960 --> 07:53.440]  time or more those early early guesses or assumptions or intuitive choices are
[07:53.440 --> 08:00.720]  you know are correct and they are winners so you know the process is based
[08:00.720 --> 08:06.240]  in science but also definitely open to the spiritual component and that which
[08:06.240 --> 08:15.120]  we can't see you know and so with that is that kind of what's I don't know man
[08:15.120 --> 08:19.280]  there's something special to your stuff like you know Marco and I've been soon
[08:19.280 --> 08:23.280]  we'll be doing this for a year now together and we you know we talked about
[08:23.280 --> 08:27.760]  a variety of different things behind the scenes and again man I don't want to
[08:27.760 --> 08:31.520]  sound too much of a cheerleader but like I want the community to know that you're
[08:31.520 --> 08:35.520]  you're one of those dudes that I don't really hear anybody talking negative on
[08:35.520 --> 08:39.800]  and sadly that's that's rare you know everybody even if they're doing good you
[08:39.800 --> 08:43.680]  know somebody has some bullshit to talk about yeah but your genetics speak for
[08:43.680 --> 08:46.800]  themselves man your Instagram speaks for itself you're constantly getting
[08:46.800 --> 08:52.280]  deleted that's like you know a badge of honor on armor these days and an honor
[08:52.280 --> 08:55.880]  in a way from the community is the fact that your stuff continues to blow up
[08:55.880 --> 09:00.600]  just a few months and you're back at it again so yeah man I think more
[09:00.600 --> 09:04.160]  individuals from our interview last time they're really just wanting to kind of
[09:04.160 --> 09:08.640]  pick your brain you know like this is almost maybe a miniature kind of like
[09:08.640 --> 09:13.040]  TED talk they really kind of wanted to understand your thinking process more
[09:13.120 --> 09:17.880]  than other things because it does seem like for probably a variety of reasons
[09:17.880 --> 09:23.040]  you mentioned like 27 different variety of reasons your stuff just continues to
[09:23.040 --> 09:27.360]  hit and continue to produce with the people that are tried and true it
[09:27.360 --> 09:32.880]  appears of ours speaking highly of it well I appreciate that man much honor and
[09:32.880 --> 09:36.360]  respect brother that's that's very nice that's what the goal is here obviously
[09:36.360 --> 09:42.760]  is to provide the finest genetics to everybody and anybody so I mean it
[09:42.760 --> 09:46.120]  really it really comes down to the whole the whole five year or ten year
[09:46.120 --> 09:52.000]  plan that I made right so so when I decided so I first got I was in the
[09:52.000 --> 09:55.920]  black market right so I wasn't on social media I wasn't on YouTube I wasn't out
[09:55.920 --> 09:59.280]  there because I was doing a lot of black market stuff and I didn't want to take
[09:59.280 --> 10:02.880]  any risk so as you know as soon as I started seeing people on Instagram
[10:02.880 --> 10:06.880]  getting a little more brave and you know starting to get away with all this stuff
[10:06.880 --> 10:11.800]  and nobody was like getting their doors busted down by the feds you know I was
[10:11.800 --> 10:18.320]  like well back then it was a long time ago and you know I I saw that it was
[10:18.320 --> 10:23.600]  okay and I came on to the scene and I saw that what I was growing was superior
[10:23.600 --> 10:30.160]  to to most of what I saw on Instagram and I didn't have any followers at that
[10:30.160 --> 10:36.160]  time so I was like you know if I just get my stuff out there to people then
[10:36.160 --> 10:41.240]  then I can get more followers and get more notoriety and start to showcase my
[10:41.240 --> 10:46.200]  skills a little bit here so what I did was I I made at that point a ten-year
[10:46.200 --> 10:51.840]  and a five-year plan right and in the five-year plan like the first step was
[10:51.840 --> 10:59.960]  to to buy seeds from reputable big-name producers of genetics in the industry
[10:59.960 --> 11:05.960]  like in-house and gauge that time I gauge green and a couple other guys and
[11:05.960 --> 11:10.480]  my goal was just like grow the heck out of their stuff right and just make it
[11:10.480 --> 11:14.600]  look as good as I could so that they would be encouraged to start you know
[11:14.600 --> 11:18.440]  reposting my stuff I get a little more notoriety get some credibility in the
[11:18.440 --> 11:25.120]  industry so that was kind of stage one of that plan and this does go into the
[11:25.120 --> 11:31.000]  genetics and why why you you're saying what you're saying there so then I got
[11:31.000 --> 11:35.320]  some attention from some some breeders like in-house and gauge dreams some of
[11:35.320 --> 11:42.160]  my earliest you know supporters who are family you know I mean and as soon as
[11:42.160 --> 11:46.800]  that occurred they saw my skill and they start offering testers so then I said
[11:46.800 --> 11:51.960]  you know I've got these two great companies on my side I can now go to
[11:51.960 --> 11:56.360]  other breeders and get get seeds and test their stuff as well and I said I
[11:56.360 --> 12:00.320]  want to grow the best of the best I just want to have the best of the best so I
[12:00.320 --> 12:05.560]  decided to go to the top and I made a list of the top 25 breeders in my
[12:05.560 --> 12:09.080]  opinion and I made a list and I contacted and I reached out to or
[12:09.080 --> 12:13.040]  attempted to contact every one of those people and some of them didn't respond
[12:13.040 --> 12:16.840]  and a lot of them responded and I got testers from a lot of these great
[12:16.840 --> 12:22.000]  breeders right so I was basically at that point kind of female hunting
[12:22.000 --> 12:27.920]  breeders because I wanted to see who really had the fire like everybody says
[12:27.920 --> 12:31.280]  they have the best everybody says they have the fire so I wanted to see
[12:31.280 --> 12:36.560]  firsthand for myself where the fire was where the herms are you know where the
[12:36.560 --> 12:46.200]  magic is so I out of the 25 breeders I think I got 21 of them I think like 16
[12:46.200 --> 12:49.120]  on the first round and then I added 10 more because I really wanted to get up
[12:49.120 --> 12:53.280]  to 25 number so I end up like 25 breeders where I was testing their gear
[12:53.440 --> 12:58.520]  and then I started really growing it well and all those breeders are you know
[12:58.520 --> 13:03.480]  reposting it and and sharing all the content because obviously it helps them
[13:03.480 --> 13:09.480]  sell seeds people can see how fire it could be etc so during this process I
[13:09.480 --> 13:12.880]  started doing bigger and bigger pheno hunts because then breeders started
[13:12.880 --> 13:18.480]  contacting me say we you know please go ahead and test these out for us grow and
[13:18.480 --> 13:22.840]  show whatever you want to do so then I just started like massive phenons
[13:22.840 --> 13:26.720]  because everybody was sending me seeds I'm like I'm not not gonna grow these
[13:26.720 --> 13:30.160]  seeds I got all this magic in my hands right let's this is what it's all about
[13:30.160 --> 13:36.200]  so then I just got bigger that's when I you know went to Oregon and we consulted
[13:36.200 --> 13:41.680]  for a grow up there where I was like a live-in cultivation thing on on a large
[13:41.680 --> 13:46.880]  property out in the middle of nowhere I was licensed so then I started showing
[13:46.880 --> 13:52.120]  more and more stuff on Instagram and I had more room to test so we started just
[13:52.120 --> 13:58.560]  testing a whole heap of genetics just tons and tons of genetics and then
[13:58.560 --> 14:04.360]  obviously started keeping the winners so my goal of having the best genetics and
[14:04.360 --> 14:10.760]  pheno hunting the best breeders was well underway at that point and so then I
[14:10.760 --> 14:16.040]  start taking the best of the best phenos and growing and growing and growing and
[14:16.040 --> 14:20.800]  growing them and then the consulting deal in Oregon was over with it was a
[14:20.800 --> 14:26.160]  year-long thing we left we came out of Oklahoma because at that time and still
[14:26.160 --> 14:32.280]  the licenses are so that once your license is a cultivator you have an
[14:32.280 --> 14:38.200]  unlimited number of plants you can grow so I was like well if I'm gonna be doing
[14:38.200 --> 14:43.320]  massive pheno hunts let's just cut to the chase and go to Oklahoma there's no
[14:43.320 --> 14:48.960]  canopy limit there's no plant number limit so let's let's just do this and
[14:48.960 --> 14:54.280]  then we started you know the first thing that we did in Oklahoma was I
[14:54.280 --> 14:58.920]  started to be a thousand seeds and I put ended up putting I think 780 of them in
[14:58.920 --> 15:03.720]  the flower and we finished about 650 of them that weren't Herms or mutants and
[15:03.720 --> 15:08.480]  all that stuff so that's where the white truffle came from is in that hunt there
[15:08.480 --> 15:13.880]  a lot of a lot of great plants that we work with a lot of our love seeds came
[15:13.880 --> 15:19.880]  from that pheno hunt and then I just I got like phenol fever man after that I
[15:19.880 --> 15:24.000]  just like wanted to go bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger so I'm just
[15:24.000 --> 15:29.640]  constantly looking for more places to hunt so belief on that same line of
[15:29.640 --> 15:32.400]  thinking when you found the white truffle since that's where we're at
[15:32.400 --> 15:38.000]  right here what was that like man were there others which were very close or
[15:38.000 --> 15:47.120]  did that stand out you know on her own you know yeah yes both actually so
[15:47.120 --> 15:52.360]  fresh coast gifted the seeds to us so I pheno hunted those and tested them for
[15:52.360 --> 15:57.320]  him before release and you repeat can you repeat that part because a lot of
[15:57.320 --> 16:01.480]  people man we're saying some bullshit so can you just repeat that aspect again
[16:01.480 --> 16:08.560]  yeah so fresh coast gifted the the gorilla butter f2 seeds among other
[16:08.560 --> 16:14.560]  seeds like the ape face the gorilla nut there was a bunch of other there was
[16:14.560 --> 16:19.000]  like seven or eight that he gifted to us that were the gorilla butter line right
[16:19.000 --> 16:26.480]  so the gorilla butter f2 was was where the wife trouble came from so we tested
[16:26.480 --> 16:30.540]  those out for him we were also testing for in house in that same room as well
[16:30.540 --> 16:36.420]  as canterotto we tested a lot of our love seeds in that room there was some
[16:36.420 --> 16:42.500]  sunken treasure gear in that room there was a lit farms gear in that room so
[16:42.500 --> 16:48.420]  there was quite a few fire breeze look at that how beautiful so yeah so when
[16:48.420 --> 16:52.940]  when I was at day 40 and that you know the white truffle started talking to me
[16:52.940 --> 16:57.820]  and she at that point her name was just gorilla butter f2 number 12 you know I
[16:57.820 --> 17:05.700]  mean so she just I mean she had that aura she had that special vibe about her
[17:05.700 --> 17:10.460]  or it was she was just begging for attention she was you know her stem rub
[17:10.460 --> 17:16.460]  was off the charts her structure was beautiful she just had the vibe she just
[17:16.460 --> 17:19.900]  had the vibe when you walk into a room like maybe walk into like a club or a
[17:19.900 --> 17:23.100]  bar or something like that and there's that one girl you catch her eyes you
[17:23.100 --> 17:26.620]  know I mean there's like a hundred girls in there right and that one girl just
[17:26.620 --> 17:30.220]  she's shouting at you from the second you walk the vibe is just right you know
[17:30.220 --> 17:36.420]  I mean yeah so so it was around when I started paying really close attention
[17:36.420 --> 17:39.940]  or started taking pictures over among other girls you know there's probably
[17:39.940 --> 17:44.300]  another hundred girls and I was taking pictures of at that time but she at day
[17:44.300 --> 17:50.780]  45 I remember this because it was so it was so crazy I remember a day 45 I just
[17:50.780 --> 17:54.620]  I just I was walking and she just caught my attention like over my shoulder so yo
[17:54.940 --> 18:01.340]  she was just screaming you know look at me look at me and I just reached down there you know
[18:01.340 --> 18:05.820]  down low and just kind of rubbed a little little leaf down real low and
[18:05.820 --> 18:14.220]  smell I was like oh my god that smells like freaking white truffles and my son
[18:14.220 --> 18:17.740]  was in the room with me and he's like really and I was like yeah smell this
[18:17.740 --> 18:21.420]  he came and smelled it and he was like oh my god I was like you smell it too
[18:21.420 --> 18:25.260]  right it smells like white truffle right and he's all yeah that smells like
[18:25.260 --> 18:29.740]  white truffle oil I was like oh my god bro are you freaking serious and I was like
[18:29.740 --> 18:36.700]  I like ran down the hall ran back like white truffle what a perfect plan
[18:36.700 --> 18:41.740]  because like so I worked 15 years in in restaurants and fine fine restaurants so
[18:41.740 --> 18:45.420]  white truffles you know you're shaving them on the food I that's totally my
[18:45.420 --> 18:51.020]  vibe like I love to cook I have white truffle oil in you know in my house you
[18:51.020 --> 18:55.980]  know at my parents house I go to I got white truffle oil there just in case so
[18:55.980 --> 18:59.660]  it's totally my vibe and I was like there's no way she smells like out of
[18:59.660 --> 19:03.420]  everything she could possibly smell like how is it that she smells like white
[19:03.420 --> 19:06.860]  like white truffle and then the next day I came in there and I was like
[19:06.860 --> 19:12.380]  right when the lights came on I was like oh my god it still smells like white truffle
[19:12.380 --> 19:16.780]  and then like like every few days after that all the way till the end and then you know I
[19:16.780 --> 19:20.060]  chopped I was like there's no way she's gonna keep that you know she's not gonna
[19:20.060 --> 19:25.100]  smell like that afterwards she got no straight up straight up white truffle so
[19:26.300 --> 19:30.940]  yeah that's I remember that day I found her too I facetimed fresh coast and I was like bro
[19:31.500 --> 19:35.980]  you're never gonna believe what I just smelled like check this out and like we both got super
[19:35.980 --> 19:41.900]  excited again it was really cool times um that's amazing and I appreciate you I appreciate you
[19:41.900 --> 19:46.380]  saying that because I think some people get things or maybe someone tells them something
[19:46.380 --> 19:51.980]  that's not the right way and then they just echo chamber that yeah I mean just you you're gifted
[19:51.980 --> 19:56.700]  the seeds and then you did the work and then you found that and then out of respect you hit him
[19:56.700 --> 20:01.660]  back up I mean that's about as clear as day as I understand how it works is there anything more than
[20:01.660 --> 20:06.140]  that more than that bro I know I know the rules and the regulations in this industry come on man
[20:06.140 --> 20:12.860]  I know the unspoken words uh the first person who got white truffle cut was fresh coast after that
[20:12.860 --> 20:16.940]  call I said I'm sending you a cut and I sent it to him right away and he got it that's how he got it
[20:18.380 --> 20:25.100]  right away and as a normal rule I those were testers so they're not released yet so I sell a
[20:25.100 --> 20:30.700]  lot of clones bro uh I don't sell clones of testers until they're released by the breeder
[20:30.700 --> 20:35.980]  and it's 90 days or more that goes by right so that stayed with me and it stayed with him period
[20:36.860 --> 20:45.420]  so um I mean that's the story of white truffle he got it for me um I got the seeds from him so it's
[20:45.420 --> 20:50.380]  kind of a joint partnership um and then I saw something special and I kept telling him bro I
[20:50.380 --> 20:57.980]  was like this chick's magic you know before he finished growing her out and um even when he got
[20:57.980 --> 21:03.020]  done finished he's like yeah she's nice you know maybe not the best female of that maybe not exactly
[21:03.020 --> 21:10.540]  what he was looking for um but I love her I I fell in love with her I was like bro um I'm I'm all
[21:10.540 --> 21:14.380]  I'm head over heels about this girl and I'm going to be doing a lot of stuff with her and you know
[21:14.380 --> 21:21.180]  it was all good it was all good we did the s1 collaboration together he did uh an s1 in in his
[21:21.180 --> 21:27.900]  facilities uh over there and then I did an s1 uh over here and we came together we collabed on that
[21:27.900 --> 21:33.980]  release he released his due to packaging issues we had we were going to have like a co-branded
[21:33.980 --> 21:40.540]  package but uh I don't know timing just didn't work out or whatever um but so we release our
[21:40.540 --> 21:46.220]  our own packaging on those so like you'll see the belief the black packets that have all my
[21:46.220 --> 21:51.980]  logo on them it says you know uh white truffle s1 and he has his that he released with his logo and
[21:51.980 --> 22:01.180]  stuff yep that's the one native love and respect right in the back of that so yeah that um I mean
[22:01.180 --> 22:07.260]  we could talk about the white truffle story all day not super into uh yeah just to clarify we can
[22:07.260 --> 22:11.500]  move on man definitely I appreciate you like clearing that up and for everybody that doesn't
[22:11.500 --> 22:17.660]  know that's the story and that's it so that's it um and I you know hey so just to keep it 100
[22:18.060 --> 22:27.260]  yeah I got some seeds in the mail too oh truffle gasm all right nice so let's just be clear so when
[22:27.260 --> 22:32.060]  folks I know a lot of people are rocking your gear you bless me with these so I'm going to
[22:32.060 --> 22:37.180]  hunt through them and in my mind the proper etiquette is if I find one that I think is
[22:37.180 --> 22:41.900]  really awesome then I'm going to say brother b leaf I got a plant which is awesome I'm going to
[22:41.900 --> 22:49.340]  shoot it to you and and then what would be is that proper um so I gifted those seeds to you right
[22:49.340 --> 22:57.820]  right so that would be proper etiquette now now for me I'm way too busy I got way too many pheno
[22:57.820 --> 23:04.060]  hunts to really care and I'm not a plant police I'm not going to be chasing people around with
[23:04.060 --> 23:09.660]  a fucking baton talking about this or that okay bro you can do whatever you want with those seeds
[23:09.660 --> 23:14.060]  you can breed with them you can find a winner and s1 that and sell the fuck out of it and give me
[23:14.060 --> 23:20.380]  no pennies I'll be I don't care bro it's good those are your seeds I gave those to you see that's
[23:20.380 --> 23:25.340]  how I always look at gifts man when I was raised I was raised that if you gift someone something you
[23:25.340 --> 23:30.780]  gift them that without expecting anything in return now like you said if you got proper etiquette if
[23:30.780 --> 23:36.140]  you feel like the gift shouldn't should be reciprocated that's different but um never give
[23:36.140 --> 23:40.540]  expecting in return because that's going to leave the problems down the road oh expectations
[23:40.540 --> 23:48.460]  especially when they're unspoken expectations well said on that and I think it also in hindsight at
[23:48.460 --> 23:53.180]  least in the underground days it would show you Marco I think I would say you would probably agree
[23:53.180 --> 23:58.780]  with this who's really eaten and who's not because of the breeder like you said if he should be too
[23:58.780 --> 24:04.700]  busy to really even focus on drama and stuff like that so uh again I mean these these are more just
[24:04.700 --> 24:08.860]  like receipts for the community I'm proud that Marco and I have the the platform with Chad and
[24:08.860 --> 24:13.340]  Peter to be able to discuss these things that they can hear from the horse's mouth man and then I I
[24:13.340 --> 24:18.940]  hope that uh our community then moves forward there's there's so much shit going out there um
[24:18.940 --> 24:25.420]  but the reality is is that the genetics matter and Bee Leaf is uh at the top of his game thank you
[24:25.420 --> 24:31.500]  brother appreciate that yeah man respect respect yes yes and so I want to shout out to my homie
[24:31.500 --> 24:38.540]  Red Dirt I see you rocking the hat Bee Leaf yeah so that leads into kind of the dipping sticks you
[24:38.540 --> 24:44.700]  um you did get send me a pack of testers which I love bazinga dipping sticks I got a couple of
[24:44.700 --> 24:49.020]  those going I'm excited and I was talking to brother James and he has some exciting um things
[24:49.020 --> 24:53.180]  going on you want to share anything about uh dipping sticks or it was too early
[24:55.500 --> 24:59.420]  is there anything you want to you know kind of talk about upcoming on that line or are you just
[24:59.500 --> 25:07.340]  kind of uh still right still being cool with it bro the difference is crazy okay so I'm behind
[25:07.340 --> 25:12.060]  testing on the different sticks like I've sent them out to testers I've had people flower them
[25:12.060 --> 25:18.140]  out and finish them and I haven't even I've only popped two of the strains so I'm behind on testing
[25:18.140 --> 25:25.100]  the different sticks um there's just so much demand on our clones bro and so much demand on
[25:25.260 --> 25:30.380]  the phenos and the phenons it's very difficult to keep up so I I'd like to have more room we're
[25:30.380 --> 25:36.380]  building the team but we're not going to do it so fast that we that we you know skip up um so
[25:36.380 --> 25:40.940]  the dip and six line has not been tested by Mia but I can tell you this I could tell you that a
[25:40.940 --> 25:47.820]  guy on my team a really cool one of my managers team member uh his name is Destry um yeah boof
[25:47.900 --> 25:55.340]  proof on Instagram um he just finished yeah boof proof isn't that funny I laughed the first time I
[25:55.340 --> 26:00.700]  heard that like that's so dope why didn't I think of that that's so dope anyways um he just grew out
[26:00.700 --> 26:04.780]  the chimera number one times dipping sticks testers that he got for me because I you know
[26:04.780 --> 26:08.940]  I hand out seeds to my team especially if they do something super fire I like to reward them with
[26:08.940 --> 26:17.340]  some seeds and stuff um but he grew them out he flowered out uh six females and they're all winners
[26:17.340 --> 26:24.380]  every single one he's six out of six they're all big they're all stinky they're all icy six out of
[26:24.380 --> 26:32.940]  six and so that's that's a victory I like that um the dippins I've got the dipping sticks uh
[26:32.940 --> 26:38.300]  creature cross or the creature kind of dipping sticks cross uh in my phenol hunt now so I've got
[26:38.300 --> 26:42.460]  uh 17 of those girls that will be in the next phenol hunt for my little phenol hunt room
[26:43.020 --> 26:47.900]  um I think that's really it there's a lot of testers getting good results um
[26:47.900 --> 26:53.820]  yeah let's see he had an exaltation three on yeah it was good and that looked ridiculous yeah
[26:55.100 --> 26:59.340]  red dirt's growing a lot of that bro a lot of the dipping sticks liner now he's he's reporting fire
[26:59.340 --> 27:04.380]  we're gonna go visit him in about 10 or 15 days because he's at like day 50 right now on his
[27:04.380 --> 27:10.940]  flowering so he's got some fire dipping sticks crosses and testing over there as well um
[27:12.620 --> 27:17.020]  look and that kind of takes us back to the conversation where we stopped in the white
[27:17.020 --> 27:23.420]  truffle in terms of the genetic you know uh why are the genetics fire what's what is the difference
[27:23.980 --> 27:30.940]  so so the big phenol that we started in Oklahoma are the next chapter in that so when we found the
[27:30.940 --> 27:38.300]  white truffle we found a lot of others and then we grew um we had a 35 light room we grew uh 2,500
[27:38.300 --> 27:45.660]  seeds right and we harvested 1,600 plants so that gave us a ton of fire winners and that was just
[27:45.660 --> 27:51.740]  ton of in-house gear a ton of uh the love seeds from us um and a lot of great producers in there
[27:51.740 --> 27:57.900]  um square one was in that room um soul fire was in that room we got winner after winner after
[27:57.900 --> 28:04.540]  winner in that room so then you know of course the natural progression for me would be to take those
[28:04.540 --> 28:09.820]  winners and and cross them so what I've done effectively is I've taken the breeders
[28:09.820 --> 28:18.940]  in the industry I narrowed it down to the top 25 in my opinion um and then I got their testers which
[28:18.940 --> 28:23.660]  one could argue would be like their best new stuff right that's what they're going to be releasing is
[28:23.660 --> 28:30.380]  their best stuff usually so then I got all their best gear right and now I phenol hunt it so I find
[28:30.380 --> 28:35.740]  the best winners of all that from all these different breeders and then I take all this
[28:35.740 --> 28:45.580]  stuff and I start crossing it so that and the vibe and the the phenol just a massive phenol hunts
[28:45.580 --> 28:51.660]  which allows me to be super picky right that's the core of this whole thing is I wasn't planting
[28:51.660 --> 28:58.300]  2,500 seeds 6,500 seeds at a time you know you can't be that picky there's plants that I throw
[28:58.300 --> 29:04.940]  away that my team's like bro I'll take those and most people would because yeah if I wasn't doing
[29:04.940 --> 29:10.140]  2,500 seed phenol hunts I would take those too but I am so I don't have to take that you know what I
[29:10.140 --> 29:16.140]  mean you could be more picky the more seeds you plant so that's what it comes down to so planting
[29:16.140 --> 29:21.340]  hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and thousands and thousands of seeds over and over and over and
[29:21.340 --> 29:26.220]  getting the best of the best of the best and then crossing those and taking the best and crossing
[29:26.220 --> 29:32.460]  those and taking the best you know that's the goal that was the plan is to get the best genetics
[29:32.460 --> 29:38.700]  and that's the way we did it you know that's how anything man breeding dogs breeding whatever if
[29:38.700 --> 29:43.420]  you're breeding for specific traits then that's how you do it you keep breeding the strongest
[29:43.420 --> 29:49.500]  back the ones with the traits you like the most back and end up with something stable and that's
[29:49.500 --> 29:56.380]  why you got stable trichomes right I mean that's what's stable yeah man and then you start to see
[29:57.100 --> 30:01.900]  yeah Brian were you gonna say something bro well I from your background you were saying a lot of
[30:01.900 --> 30:06.940]  those genetics I know you you just mentioned soul fire from from my understanding that gentleman was
[30:06.940 --> 30:13.100]  came up kind of underneath exotic Mike so you kind of are dabbling in both of those those worlds
[30:13.900 --> 30:18.620]  I would say some people some of that stuff seemed hype and then other stuff when it came from to
[30:18.620 --> 30:26.620]  soul fire it seemed like maybe the student became the the mentor maybe I shouldn't say it that way
[30:26.620 --> 30:32.140]  but I hope I hope you get what I'm saying it seemed like he took his took his artwork to the
[30:32.140 --> 30:37.580]  next level definitely I agree I think they're they're fired they're both great breeders I've
[30:37.580 --> 30:42.060]  grown out both their gear and I've had great results I've got winners from both of them
[30:42.060 --> 30:47.740]  in my garden that I play with the strawberry Gary from exotic that I have is insane haven't talked
[30:47.740 --> 30:53.260]  about her or released her anything like that but I'm gonna be breeding she's actually in the
[30:53.260 --> 30:58.140]  breeding room right now with the truffle number one so she's gonna be coming to the forefront
[30:58.140 --> 31:02.860]  soon but you know every plant's got her day she's super fire I wanted to grow her twice to make sure
[31:02.860 --> 31:07.740]  she was as far as I thought she was so and then from soul fire you know my gucci fruit is insane
[31:07.740 --> 31:13.580]  she's a staple in my on my menu a lot of people know her a lot of people love her it's that funky
[31:13.660 --> 31:23.100]  fruity huge producing gal super dense and just crazy colors she keeps those bright orange yarn
[31:23.100 --> 31:30.540]  thick hairs after harvest they stay there and it's just as dark purple this orange vibrant orange
[31:30.540 --> 31:36.620]  it's crazy it looks like it's from outer space and it smells like it too she's stinky so yeah
[31:36.620 --> 31:41.340]  soul fire is great so if I was a great breeder there's a lot of great breeders out there and
[31:41.340 --> 31:45.660]  you know we don't just plant great breeders and known beers if somebody sent any seeds and
[31:45.660 --> 31:49.500]  I don't know who they are I'll grow those out too because you never know where the next fire could be
[31:50.540 --> 31:55.500]  so you know you know we don't prejudice seeds or anything like that we grow anything and everything
[31:55.500 --> 32:01.660]  out that were sent in due time I just need more space so yeah and I mentioned that because it
[32:01.660 --> 32:06.460]  seems like you have had your pulse kind of on genetics for a long time now I mean I would
[32:06.460 --> 32:12.220]  consider soul fire kind of maybe a newer older breeder relatively speaking but somebody that
[32:12.220 --> 32:18.380]  definitely earned his stripes and yeah and then I I feel like and you know as that's now happening
[32:18.380 --> 32:22.860]  there's individuals that have that skill set to to grow the flower to breed the genetics and now
[32:22.860 --> 32:28.780]  to wash the flower as well and that's to me man that's I mean you could literally become your own
[32:28.780 --> 32:34.220]  brand especially like you had mentioned moving out to Oklahoma where if you're used to you know kind
[32:34.220 --> 32:41.260]  of an expensive lifestyle moving down there is a breath of fresh air yeah definitely yeah it's
[32:41.260 --> 32:47.980]  definitely a very cost effective in Oklahoma the land is very cheap you know my uh my land uh that
[32:47.980 --> 32:54.060]  were you know getting buildings and power and everything set up on now uh Blackberry Ramps was
[32:54.060 --> 32:57.740]  very inexpensive uh by the time we get done with it we'll have a little paradise out there a little
[32:57.740 --> 33:03.820]  piece of paradise metal warehouses everywhere and lights and plants and love love going on you know
[33:03.820 --> 33:10.140]  so yeah it's it's great out here man um I love Oklahoma I love the political climate um the people
[33:10.140 --> 33:15.820]  stand up for their rights out here uh the state often attempts to pass laws or changes to the
[33:15.820 --> 33:22.780]  cannabis laws and the people stand up and we fight it and uh people call uh their representatives and
[33:22.780 --> 33:27.660]  we you know the people have more power here than it seems like in other places I've lived at least
[33:27.660 --> 33:32.220]  they execute that power I should say a little more effectively they're just more independent out here
[33:32.220 --> 33:37.100]  they're crazy they don't you know they're very into doing things the way they want to do it and
[33:37.100 --> 33:41.740]  they don't like the government getting in the way and I love that so less government intervention I
[33:41.740 --> 33:47.740]  think is a very good thing especially in cannabis um everything yeah I think it's pretty much
[33:47.740 --> 33:52.300]  everything right I mean people everything you don't need them I mean the word government is
[33:52.300 --> 34:00.140]  Latin for mind control so I mean you don't need to know anything for real that almost seems too
[34:00.140 --> 34:07.100]  good to be true man I mean that's it so let's let's talk a little bit about how just how picky
[34:07.100 --> 34:11.740]  you can be belief like so when you're running when you're popping just say a hundred seed right
[34:11.740 --> 34:17.820]  yeah are you are you so picky that when a seed is slow to germ or or it will it germs but it's slower
[34:17.820 --> 34:24.140]  than the rest to um to to kind of get established are you so picky that you'll chop then or do you
[34:24.140 --> 34:29.740]  always wait and flower everything out if it seems like it's a decent plant at least great question
[34:29.900 --> 34:37.020]  I used to wait I used to wait it out and give every girl a chance you know I just love the
[34:37.020 --> 34:41.900]  plants so much that I don't want to chop them especially if there's a little girl you know
[34:41.900 --> 34:45.500]  what I mean like poor little girl over there she needs help she doesn't need to feel the same way
[34:47.660 --> 34:54.540]  you know so I used to have a really difficult time and you know the way we feel and and moving
[34:54.620 --> 35:00.460]  bigger and bigger I just can't do that anymore it's just not reasonable for me to do I've tried
[35:00.460 --> 35:05.340]  different techniques with keeping the little girls around you know putting them on the outside of the
[35:05.340 --> 35:10.060]  beds or you know on the outside of the table so they get that side lighting it doesn't matter
[35:10.060 --> 35:14.060]  what you do they're going to be they're going to be overwhelmed and what's the best thing that's
[35:14.060 --> 35:20.540]  going to happen she's going to flower out be super insane super tasty super stinky but she's going to
[35:20.540 --> 35:28.140]  be very very slow and small that's not really a winner you know especially when I got you know
[35:28.140 --> 35:36.300]  another 1699 plants that are screaming to be a winner and don't grow slow so now I've evolved
[35:38.060 --> 35:44.940]  into a I found the balance you know of being able to cull them respectfully without feeling bad
[35:44.940 --> 35:50.860]  about it and just moving on and just had to look it's part of the game yeah if you want a female
[35:50.860 --> 35:55.660]  hunt any bigger than this you can't be held up on girls that aren't going to keep up it's just the
[35:55.660 --> 36:02.540]  way it is yeah one thing I do man is I go and put them in the JLF and I say well you can feed my next
[36:02.540 --> 36:08.460]  round of girls you know what I mean so that love stays stays right there I love that I love that
[36:08.460 --> 36:16.860]  that's a great solution yeah they just live on live on yeah hey uh I think we've mentioned this
[36:16.860 --> 36:21.340]  a couple times maybe even last time you were on the show but is there truth to like you know when
[36:21.340 --> 36:28.380]  you're squeezing seeds for the the vibrance of it uh it's got to be it's got to be extremely hard
[36:28.380 --> 36:33.580]  and you know you're kind of looking for tiger eye do all those kind of like old school type
[36:34.460 --> 36:39.340]  maybe processes is then is there truth to any of that stuff and if so which ones were true
[36:40.700 --> 36:48.220]  I find less truth to that than than I do find truth so no um so so we go through our see
[36:48.220 --> 36:52.620]  obviously we sort our seeds the seeds for sale people who are buyers have an expectation what
[36:52.620 --> 36:57.980]  that seed is going to look like right so they want dark hard tiger stuff that's what the expectation
[36:57.980 --> 37:03.100]  is and if it arrives less than that you know they're disappointed if they're buying a belief
[37:03.180 --> 37:07.660]  cannabis product they're probably expecting some superior results they're probably expecting to
[37:07.660 --> 37:14.780]  have some fire so if they if they have an idea that white seeds or immature seeds to a certain
[37:14.780 --> 37:22.540]  extent are not going to be as viable then that's going to shed a harsh light on on my my company
[37:22.540 --> 37:29.980]  myself etc so whether or not it's true we're going to live up to that standard just to make sure that
[37:30.380 --> 37:34.860]  we're checking up all the boxes with our buyers and our clients are getting exactly what they want
[37:34.860 --> 37:41.340]  every time or more right so with that said so I have a bunch of immature seeds all of them that
[37:41.340 --> 37:48.620]  we've gone through and decided are not commercially uh judged as as the right seats to sell so we plant
[37:48.620 --> 37:55.180]  those a lot right um I can tell you that the germination rate is going to be lower if they're
[37:55.180 --> 38:02.060]  not tiger stripe if they're not solid if they're not pinch proof right but that doesn't mean they
[38:02.060 --> 38:09.740]  won't germinate so for example I um the first time I planted the truffle treats um which is
[38:09.740 --> 38:15.500]  white truffle times dip and sticks the first time I planted her um I had separated the seeds and once
[38:15.500 --> 38:21.180]  again I wasn't ready to do the the phenol hunt and the testing to release that that line yet but I was
[38:21.180 --> 38:25.900]  really excited about that particular cross so I went and I wanted to plant some so I said well let's
[38:25.900 --> 38:31.020]  just plant a bunch of these white ones the most immature seeds that there were and they're
[38:31.020 --> 38:36.460]  definitely every one of them would have squished under pressure under a little bit of pressure they
[38:36.460 --> 38:40.300]  would have squished and if I said I'm going to see back to a buyer I would definitely got a complaint
[38:41.180 --> 38:49.980]  you know but um and out of that 23 germinated okay so the germination rate is definitely lower
[38:50.860 --> 38:57.900]  one was a runt she didn't she didn't grow well and two grew really well both those are winners
[38:58.940 --> 39:03.580]  so that ended up being truffle treats nine and truffle treats 16 which are on my 3500
[39:03.580 --> 39:10.860]  dollar menu and my 5000 dollar call menu they're absolutely fire and number nine is gigantic
[39:10.860 --> 39:17.900]  gigantic producer as well as being super fire so um there is less of a germ rate
[39:18.860 --> 39:22.300]  but had I just thrown those seeds away those plants would never have existed
[39:24.060 --> 39:28.780]  so the worst thing that happened is out of the I think I planted like 23 or 24 and whatever it was
[39:29.980 --> 39:34.300]  out of those seeds I planted you know some of them didn't germinate who cares
[39:35.260 --> 39:40.300]  no big deal move on I found three plants and two of them were extreme fire winners
[39:41.900 --> 39:46.620]  nice yeah that's that's interesting because there's people out there that would say no way
[39:46.620 --> 39:50.220]  you could get ever get a good plant from an immature seed and I've actually germinated you
[39:50.220 --> 39:54.780]  know how you get those ones that are kind of deformed where they're kind of a little gnarly
[39:54.780 --> 40:00.940]  looking not even a good full seed I've terminated one of those before I mean it's like you said
[40:00.940 --> 40:05.900]  odds are not great but I mean there's probably people that love to get some of those immature
[40:05.900 --> 40:11.100]  seeds you just have to give a lot more you know here's yeah you know 100 seeds you might get you
[40:11.100 --> 40:18.060]  know 100 you know yeah yeah 100 seeds you get 10 or 15 of them you know you're looking pretty good
[40:18.060 --> 40:21.580]  you know what's the difference between that and a 10 pack you know or a 15 pack which
[40:21.580 --> 40:26.780]  you know you've got 10 or 15 plants that's what you came for but yeah um yeah the difference
[40:26.780 --> 40:31.820]  explains gonna be crazy truffle lines crazy I got plenty of seeds I made a big big big big big batch
[40:31.820 --> 40:35.820]  of those seeds there's plenty of white truffle crosses to go around I have a feeling we're going
[40:35.820 --> 40:40.380]  to be getting rid of those for a while which is great because more people will grow them out they're
[40:40.380 --> 40:45.260]  gonna be like oh I want to get some of those too and there's just insane phenos in these packs so
[40:45.260 --> 40:51.100]  it's gonna be fun yeah yeah I like that just on the white truffle to finish that off man I'm
[40:51.100 --> 40:56.780]  actually gonna be looking for my own because I love her she's amazing I would just want I want
[40:56.780 --> 41:01.020]  one with a little bit more of what I'm looking for you know what I mean and that's all about
[41:01.020 --> 41:07.340]  selecting you know what I mean it's just taking a good thing and then trying to do it get a little
[41:07.340 --> 41:12.700]  bit more out of it that's what I'm doing so I'm excited about that man yes Brethren for real that's
[41:12.700 --> 41:17.180]  what we want we want people to do that you know that's why I made 25 crosses of white truffle so
[41:17.180 --> 41:22.780]  everybody would have their own little you know spin on it really and then within that pack you find
[41:22.780 --> 41:27.420]  your pheno you know that one that you really really want so I think it's just magic man it's beautiful
[41:28.620 --> 41:35.660]  belief in your opinion brother uh what causes mutants and um you know what kind of break can
[41:35.660 --> 41:42.860]  you kind of also break that down and uh for maybe the newer audience um I mean mutants would be
[41:42.860 --> 41:50.460]  called I guess quote unquote unstable genetics um genetics that maybe a lot of f1s are being
[41:50.460 --> 41:56.780]  crossed with f1s you know what I mean instead of being back crossed or you know nf2 or three or
[41:56.780 --> 42:03.820]  four or five where there's a little you know a little less variance so I think that breeding a
[42:03.820 --> 42:09.100]  lot of f1s is definitely going to increase that rate but it's not the only factor and you know
[42:09.100 --> 42:13.980]  these seeds can hold genetic expressions in them for several generations that don't come out
[42:14.620 --> 42:20.380]  so if you're breeding you find something as an f1 and you say I want this and you breed that to
[42:20.380 --> 42:25.500]  something else and you make a new f1 that it could be expressing qualities or traits that you didn't
[42:25.500 --> 42:34.300]  even know were there so um yeah I would say that's probably as simple as it gets I don't think it's
[42:34.300 --> 42:38.220]  super complicated I think when you're bringing a lot of plants that haven't been stabilized by
[42:38.220 --> 42:42.300]  back crossing or other means that you're going to end up with a lot more mutants
[42:43.980 --> 42:48.780]  uh because I guess some people believe that if you know they pop a pack of beans maybe a couple
[42:48.780 --> 42:53.020]  couple packs from an individual and they have a bunch of mutants that it's just going to be
[42:53.020 --> 42:56.140]  trash because they didn't put in the time and effort and they're crossing back like you had
[42:56.140 --> 43:02.460]  just mentioned is there truth to that or it's just hey sometimes that's that's the way it goes when
[43:02.460 --> 43:08.700]  there's you know this this breeder's putting out thousands of packs so the bottom line is in that
[43:08.700 --> 43:14.380]  regard the bottom line is how many seeds do you plant to get a winner because in that regard a
[43:14.380 --> 43:21.660]  mutant is no different than a herm or a male if you're looking for a female that is um so that's
[43:21.660 --> 43:28.220]  the bottom line so mutant or not really doesn't it doesn't matter to most people the bottom line
[43:28.220 --> 43:33.580]  is if I buy a 10 pack how many winners or am I going to get a winner can I at least get one winner
[43:33.580 --> 43:39.340]  or maybe more right that's that's the deal so it doesn't I don't think it so much matters if it's a
[43:39.340 --> 43:44.700]  mutant or not so I'm saying that because specifically I have um a cross that was bred by a
[43:44.700 --> 43:49.580]  breeder I'm not going to tell uh whose name it is because people might think oh my god they have
[43:49.580 --> 43:54.700]  mutants all over the place or something like that but this breeder um gifted me these seeds to test
[43:54.700 --> 44:01.180]  years ago and I found a winner that was absolutely insane and things happened blah blah blah she was
[44:01.180 --> 44:09.820]  lost okay nobody else had her gone gone gone so in that pack it was like it was like a 15 pack
[44:10.380 --> 44:17.180]  there were no mutants uh there was two winners I was very happy with the pack so when I lost that
[44:17.180 --> 44:21.740]  plant I contacted the breeder I said will you please send me like 50 of these seeds because I
[44:21.740 --> 44:25.660]  lost that girl I really want to have her again and he said no problem he sent me like 100 seeds
[44:26.220 --> 44:32.860]  so I grew those 50 seeds out and out of those 50 like 38 or 39 of them were mutants
[44:35.980 --> 44:40.300]  none of them were in the first pack not one so
[44:40.780 --> 44:45.420]  out of that there was one that was a winner and that was the girl that I was looking for it's
[44:45.420 --> 44:49.500]  pretty much the exact same phenotype as I had lost and I was looking to get back
[44:50.220 --> 44:53.900]  so the reason I say it doesn't really matter if they're mutants or herms or this or that
[44:53.900 --> 44:59.100]  is because at the end of the day um I mean obviously there was a lot of mutants in that
[44:59.100 --> 45:02.620]  pack so maybe it's not the best example but at the end of the day I got what I was looking for
[45:02.620 --> 45:06.140]  I got that one winner and that's what you want you want that one winner you don't necessarily
[45:06.220 --> 45:11.100]  you want that one winner you don't necessarily need nine winners and you don't really care if
[45:11.100 --> 45:15.180]  the other eight were mutants if you find mac one right if you find mac one it doesn't matter
[45:15.180 --> 45:24.060]  if there were nine mutants and you got mac when you got mac one so I yeah I there's a lot of bro
[45:24.060 --> 45:32.780]  I want to write a book about testing all these accepted you know SOPs and accepted
[45:33.260 --> 45:38.460]  nuances to the industry to cultivating that is just like one guy passing on to another guy
[45:38.460 --> 45:45.820]  passing on to another guy where the root of that that tech was like 1979 Humboldt County
[45:45.820 --> 45:50.300]  you know where some guy stole the street light off the pole and was growing in his in his basement
[45:50.300 --> 45:56.220]  with that you know and he did something and it it just so happened that good results occurred
[45:56.220 --> 46:00.780]  after that and he now he attributed it to that and he passes it on to this guy who passes it
[46:00.780 --> 46:05.660]  on to this guy I think that the industry is filled with these kind of things I think that
[46:05.660 --> 46:12.380]  nobody has really taken a significant amount of time and said look here's the top 30 tech ideas
[46:12.380 --> 46:18.540]  that are accepted as standard procedures in the industry let's freaking test these let's do a
[46:18.540 --> 46:24.700]  side by side of these let's determine if they really work how they really work let's let's
[46:24.700 --> 46:30.220]  figure all this out because you know people that come to me there's some tech that I know that was
[46:30.220 --> 46:36.460]  handed down to me from 1979 Humboldt County right there's some tech that I still use from that so
[46:36.460 --> 46:41.100]  there is good stuff there I'm not saying it isn't good but I'd really like to figure out if it's
[46:41.100 --> 46:48.220]  good because just because a guy who knows how to grow told you doesn't mean it's absolutely right
[46:49.740 --> 46:55.020]  right exactly we got a thing in the construction business it says just because you've been doing
[46:55.020 --> 47:00.060]  it 20 years don't mean you were doing it right for 20 years you know right and that's key man
[47:00.460 --> 47:05.740]  that's why guys like you that actually put in the work you know that's why I like if some we're
[47:05.740 --> 47:10.940]  asking you these questions because you've planted so many seeds you know that immature seeds can be
[47:10.940 --> 47:16.460]  a winner or not you know that you know a mutant I like that way you said that that's why I threw
[47:16.460 --> 47:22.460]  up the gold bars because you said a mutant may as well be a male you know if you're only hunting
[47:22.460 --> 47:27.580]  for like you say chimera one or mac one or truffle if you're hunting for a specific thing
[47:28.300 --> 47:33.500]  does it really matter that you had to fight through a lot of shit to get that I guess it
[47:33.500 --> 47:37.980]  kind of builds character but at the end of the day when you're holding white truffle you got
[47:37.980 --> 47:42.060]  white truffle you're not going to be bashing the guy because he had you know some mutants in the
[47:42.060 --> 47:46.780]  pack right exactly I would never bash a breeder how can you bash a breeder like the breeder
[47:46.780 --> 47:51.900]  controls the genetics somehow like he did for a purpose like he knew there was a herm genetic
[47:51.980 --> 47:58.060]  to two incarnations ago or you know two lines ago or whatever like sometimes you don't know that
[47:58.060 --> 48:03.180]  like you can't everybody has herms I've grown everybody's freaking seeds everybody has herms
[48:03.180 --> 48:09.020]  news flash it happens it should happen we talked about this last time it's a beautiful thing in
[48:09.020 --> 48:13.500]  one way it's not beautiful if you're a medical grower and you have six plants and you know you
[48:13.500 --> 48:18.060]  get herms and you know you don't make cash okay so that's not so beautiful but it's not the end
[48:18.060 --> 48:22.380]  of the world also it's not and if you just look out for the herms and you catch them early then
[48:22.380 --> 48:28.460]  that will never happen so yeah that's that's that's it's a very insightful question but I
[48:28.460 --> 48:34.460]  appreciate that but that's all these numbers that we have from breeding out all these different
[48:34.460 --> 48:39.660]  breeders so I've bred with over 50 I think like 57 or 58 different breeders geared now
[48:40.300 --> 48:47.900]  so or I'm sorry tested not bred with I've tested out 57 58 different breeders gear and I've
[48:47.900 --> 48:54.940]  logged all that information so I have a spreadsheet I can tell you who has the best seeds planted
[48:54.940 --> 48:59.900]  to winners attained ratio in the industry and I could tell you where all these breeders rank
[48:59.900 --> 49:06.540]  and I could tell you who has the most herms that may just be coincidental unless I've grown out
[49:06.540 --> 49:11.340]  10 000 of that person's seeds it may be coincidental because if you've only grown out
[49:11.340 --> 49:18.700]  15 packs maybe you got three packs that were just you know herm rich so then all right let
[49:18.700 --> 49:25.900]  me keep it 100 where no no names where do you rank on that on your on that on your own list
[49:25.900 --> 49:31.100]  I really don't want to brag bro like really are you up there this is by design Rasta I did this
[49:31.100 --> 49:35.980]  by design so I don't want to brag yes I don't want to brag I purposely went out and found the best
[49:35.980 --> 49:39.740]  breeders with the best genetics and took the best of and bred those with the other best of them
[49:40.380 --> 49:47.420]  so I kind of think I might have a uh like an I don't know a dip an advantage okay I'm not
[49:48.620 --> 49:53.260]  I have an advantage but that's that's the plan I made anybody else could have made that plan
[49:54.540 --> 49:59.740]  breeders that I that I included in this included right any one of those breeders could have done
[49:59.740 --> 50:06.700]  what I did anybody who had the wherewithal and the motivation and the audacity to work 18 hour
[50:06.700 --> 50:12.140]  days for two years fucking straight could have done what I did boom right and then the question
[50:12.140 --> 50:17.420]  why didn't you do it if you could have did it you know I think you know and then and then go do it
[50:17.420 --> 50:21.740]  now why didn't you do it and then take your new fucking idea and go do that excuse my language
[50:21.740 --> 50:26.540]  get a little passionate bro this is I don't want to brag bro I don't want to brag so I tried to
[50:26.540 --> 50:33.420]  disclose these numbers but I I mean I can tell you that like I can tell you just examples that's
[50:33.420 --> 50:37.580]  six out of six when I tested the chimera seeds before I released them the first time I only
[50:37.580 --> 50:42.380]  planted four of them on the first test run uh they were four out of four winners the data was 100
[50:43.260 --> 50:49.500]  the margwa was 100 I've had more of my genetics that I've read be 100% winners on tests than
[50:49.500 --> 50:56.380]  than not when you're saying 100% winner are you saying they scored a 2700 no I'm saying that every
[50:56.380 --> 51:01.100]  seed planted was a winner was something that I kept and have you ever had anything in your
[51:01.900 --> 51:10.140]  through your data uh achieve something that's like 2500 or up 2498 is the highest score
[51:11.020 --> 51:15.020]  wow do you mind sharing what that was I'm not going to
[51:17.900 --> 51:22.620]  it will be disclosed in due time though hey sometimes Marco and I got uh the Wendy Williams
[51:22.620 --> 51:28.780]  questions too you know yeah yeah trying to get that tea trying to dig deep get that get a new
[51:28.780 --> 51:34.300]  release or at least know more about what so so the variables with this obviously are pretty heavy
[51:34.300 --> 51:40.780]  so if someone's new to this they're new to uh pheno hunting finding genetics how many seeds do
[51:40.780 --> 51:46.140]  you feel like somebody should kind of like mess with you for them to be able to I don't know gauge
[51:46.140 --> 51:52.460]  a proper opinion of your work or anybody's work I really think I think the more the better right
[51:52.460 --> 52:00.300]  the more the better um but if you that's the whole thing look if you buy a pack of my seeds
[52:00.300 --> 52:10.060]  I have a no questions asked guarantee bro you will definitely find a winner or more in every single
[52:10.060 --> 52:15.900]  pack I sell and if you don't simply contact me and I'll give you another pack if I have that same one
[52:15.900 --> 52:19.260]  and you want it I'll give you that if you want something else or greater or equal or less value
[52:19.260 --> 52:24.620]  I don't care I'll give that to you too it's not a problem I'll I so that just cut let's just catch
[52:24.620 --> 52:31.820]  the chase it's a full-on guarantee bro there's no questions asked I don't care if some guy some
[52:31.820 --> 52:36.780]  guy contacted us for example a few days ago and he sent a picture and he said I bought four different
[52:36.780 --> 52:42.780]  breeders all your seeds suck none of them popped out of 40 or so seeds I had like three that popped
[52:42.780 --> 52:44.300]  all your guys's gear is horrible
[52:48.700 --> 52:51.340]  okay cool man what pack would you like
[52:53.180 --> 52:59.980]  obviously he blew it right four different breeders 40 seeds three of them popped bro your tech is
[52:59.980 --> 53:07.580]  probably not working thank you I don't care I don't care bro take another pack you deserve
[53:08.140 --> 53:13.660]  you tried and you failed let's try it again let's get it right I want him to win but I don't sell
[53:13.660 --> 53:18.380]  seeds so that I can go get money and go on a vacation and pull damn blizzard I give people
[53:18.380 --> 53:22.940]  seats I want them to grow fire I want them to go have better fire I want to have the best of the
[53:22.940 --> 53:27.580]  best I got to the point where I found the best of the best of the best I crossed it all and now I
[53:27.580 --> 53:31.660]  want to share it with people of course I want to do so at a financial reward so I can keep doing
[53:31.660 --> 53:39.020]  what I'm doing but if you have any problem with any of my products I got a t-shirt a clone seeds
[53:39.020 --> 53:44.540]  anything you buy ever from belief it's 100 guarantee you want your money back we'll do that
[53:44.540 --> 53:49.740]  you want your pack we'll do that you want another clone I'll give you three what else do you want
[53:49.740 --> 53:54.940]  it's all generosity bro because check it out if somebody look I have thousands of seeds I have
[53:54.940 --> 53:59.820]  thousands of packs of seeds what am I gonna do I'm gonna sit on this throne of seeds when one
[53:59.820 --> 54:06.140]  guy just wants to fucking grow 10 plants that's ridiculous no guarantee 100 you buy my seeds you
[54:06.140 --> 54:12.780]  will find winners you buy some of them that I recommend like like the truffle treats you find
[54:12.780 --> 54:17.980]  three winners in the truffle treats pack you'll probably find all winners because I've grown them
[54:17.980 --> 54:22.300]  out my testers have grown them out other people have grown them out they all said the same thing
[54:22.300 --> 54:28.220]  pretty much everyone to be aware so belief on like as far as your creature crosses
[54:29.020 --> 54:31.980]  do you are they harder to germ are they tougher
[54:32.700 --> 54:37.420]  seeds to start yet you probably get a higher chance of winners
[54:38.300 --> 54:41.980]  um is have you found that with your creatures are they tougher to germ or no
[54:44.220 --> 54:49.180]  um yeah I did find a little more difficult germ rate on on some of the creature crosses
[54:49.900 --> 55:00.700]  um not much our germ rate on average for my seeds um career to date is uh 97.3 percent
[55:01.500 --> 55:07.020]  um the creature came in like 92 something I think like 92.5 something like that so it was still 92
[55:07.020 --> 55:14.940]  percent germination rate um there was a couple of packs that we just we stopped um way short of
[55:14.940 --> 55:19.740]  production uh that had a little worse germination rate that kind of pulled that down but everything
[55:19.740 --> 55:24.860]  else was good yeah okay creature has one germ the strongest was which was surprised to me because
[55:24.860 --> 55:29.180]  she's a freak the creatures she's a freak and that's why I don't sell her by clone because she's
[55:29.740 --> 55:35.500]  she's not a stable plant she's she's a wild card you know I mean when you're playing poker sometimes
[55:35.500 --> 55:43.500]  a wild card is useful so she's she's a crazy she's crazy she's a psychopath but she's not a mutant
[55:43.500 --> 55:49.500]  she's just a freak just a wild she's on the verge of being a mutant I'll tell you because she is
[55:49.500 --> 55:56.460]  just extremely vigorous and she has a vitality of craziness and so forth um but I mean just
[55:56.460 --> 56:04.940]  absolute psychopath um I feel about chimera one it's huge she's crazy bro the nug structure the
[56:04.940 --> 56:11.580]  branching she does horizontal branching um all as soon as she gets four or five nodes up she
[56:11.580 --> 56:16.860]  started doing this horizontal branching and just spread out I mean horizontal and she'll just like
[56:16.860 --> 56:22.380]  okay hold me up here and if you don't like you got stuff falling down she's crazy she's absolutely
[56:22.380 --> 56:26.940]  she her nug structure is just insane even from the beginning even before she starts you know
[56:26.940 --> 56:32.540]  creeching out as I call it and before the extreme fox tails occur she's just got this like palm it's
[56:32.540 --> 56:38.060]  like an it always forms like a palm nug instead of like a nug nug and then from this palm the fingers
[56:38.060 --> 56:42.300]  start to grow out and she's just she's like no other plant in the world and that's why I'm going
[56:42.300 --> 56:47.580]  to continue to breed with her line after line after line after line I've got a room it's the creature
[56:47.580 --> 56:53.820]  line room and I'm just going to continue to find winners outside of the creature lines and then
[56:53.820 --> 57:02.300]  cross them to the creature because she improves every plant that she touches nice yeah let's pop
[57:02.300 --> 57:08.140]  in here and say real quick that kool-aid man was a creature cross two out of two popped on them
[57:08.140 --> 57:13.660]  two winners I'll show you later but oh yeah to speak what you're talking about two winners no
[57:13.660 --> 57:19.420]  let's pop it up you got you got uh the pictures right yeah yeah I got some pictures I got like a
[57:19.420 --> 57:26.300]  quick quick uh 30 second video to see if I could play thank you just uh yeah I mean real quick
[57:27.100 --> 57:39.580]  like she's fucking she's a yeah she's a winner uh I mean I've honestly I've never grown anything
[57:40.460 --> 57:48.560]  with so many trichomes on it so that's just a quick shot of the top
[57:48.560 --> 57:52.720]  and then I got a little bit of the bottom too for you great day
[57:53.440 --> 57:58.240]  now I remember on the forum days back in the day that when you would have finally get the trichomes
[57:58.240 --> 58:06.480]  on the fendies that's when you were you know a cannabis whip to really take it obviously
[58:07.200 --> 58:13.280]  the genetics and then your tech is uh proving worthwhile same thing with uh mr marcus over there
[58:13.280 --> 58:18.000]  wow those are gorgeous and I noticed that you didn't shave the legs at all you left all the
[58:18.080 --> 58:21.600]  I noticed that you didn't shave the legs at all you left all the bottom branching and there's
[58:21.600 --> 58:27.440]  still fat nugs up and down there's still fat nugs they're still absolutely the same trichome
[58:27.440 --> 58:33.600]  coverage from the very bottom branch to the very top branch and it's in a water only soil
[58:33.600 --> 58:39.920]  I was doing a water only uh experiment so this has nothing but what came in the soil I didn't do
[58:39.920 --> 58:46.720]  anything special to the plants training defoliation nothing I just kind of let them go and yeah this
[58:46.800 --> 58:52.560]  was you know a few a few weeks ago so it still has about three weeks after this picture and it
[58:52.560 --> 59:00.080]  stacks trichomes every day so nice and what does she smell like like the most intense the most
[59:00.080 --> 59:05.680]  intense fruit punch like the kool-aid man seriously just kicked down your door and said what's up
[59:05.680 --> 59:15.120]  motherfuckers yeah yeah you know you get any kind of like effervescent almost like like when you're
[59:15.120 --> 59:20.080]  smelling champagne all the bubbles almost burn you do you get any of that from her I can't say
[59:20.080 --> 59:27.280]  that I do right now no because it's it's so strong fruit punch that it's just I can't smell anything
[59:27.280 --> 59:33.200]  else I love it I love it that's why I keep reading with the creature everything she touches turns
[59:33.200 --> 59:39.200]  like just frosty and it enhances the existing you know turps and then she adds in this just
[59:39.200 --> 59:44.720]  tropical gas fruit thing look at that who is who's who did you cross with for this girl
[59:44.720 --> 59:51.200]  that's an amazing job absolutely this is a watermelon mimosa 10 by lit farm so this is a
[59:51.200 --> 59:57.760]  collab with ray over at lit farms and myself yeah it's all right look at her look at that shot right
[59:57.760 --> 01:00:05.920]  there wow oh my god yeah I've I've never I've never seen anything like this in my garden or
[01:00:05.920 --> 01:00:13.920]  anybody else's garden in person so uh I I popped two beans people I popped two and that was one of
[01:00:13.920 --> 01:00:22.960]  them so there you go all right sorry sorry for the interruption but I I wanted to show and tell
[01:00:22.960 --> 01:00:30.320]  and say thank you for making that happen appreciate that nice boom fire there's no way to fake the
[01:00:30.320 --> 01:00:37.280]  funk with that man if it's water only I mean water only guys come on wow especially if you're brand
[01:00:37.280 --> 01:00:42.560]  new to this and you uh you could start growing cannabis uh without without even having any
[01:00:42.560 --> 01:00:46.720]  issues you know you could just really start off with uh almost growing the rolls royce from the
[01:00:46.720 --> 01:00:52.320]  from day one I mean that's part of the phenol too we don't we don't we don't play with plants that
[01:00:52.320 --> 01:00:57.840]  have issues you know I mean we can be so picky so any of that stuff any of those issues any growth
[01:00:57.840 --> 01:01:02.720]  problems are just weaned out before they get into the gene pool you know it's just straight fire in
[01:01:02.720 --> 01:01:08.480]  the gene pool and we've got so many new lines coming as well so yeah we've got the white truffle
[01:01:08.480 --> 01:01:14.640]  line available now at boomfi.com I think Neptune and a couple you know uh get c2 now and stuff have
[01:01:14.640 --> 01:01:20.480]  some as well but boomfi.com is our website we have a full stock of the white truffle and then so the
[01:01:20.480 --> 01:01:27.920]  dip and sticks will be dropping next then it'll be the truffle aloha s1 truffle number one s1
[01:01:28.720 --> 01:01:32.960]  and then it'll be the chimera number three line which is also in testing right now
[01:01:33.840 --> 01:01:40.720]  um after that we have I did a reversal on the truffle treats number nine so we'll have s1s of
[01:01:40.720 --> 01:01:44.480]  that and then we'll have yeah there's the website over there thank you Marco I appreciate that
[01:01:45.120 --> 01:01:51.520]  um and then we'll have I let her hit the daily grape nine also so that's just a little small
[01:01:51.520 --> 01:01:56.240]  release where there's going to be daily grape nine times truffle treats nine and then truffle treats
[01:01:56.240 --> 01:02:02.720]  nine s1s and then after that would be the odo one line we have another uh another creature line
[01:02:02.720 --> 01:02:07.680]  coming actually two of them back to back so we got tons of seeds coming at you and they're all
[01:02:07.680 --> 01:02:13.040]  going to be better and better every time yeah definitely we got we actually have that odo we
[01:02:13.040 --> 01:02:19.520]  have three different uh phenos growing uh the orange gorilla and myself oh nice friday night
[01:02:20.480 --> 01:02:29.360]  on me guys thank you yeah man just uh yeah man that's some fun stuff so just to let everybody
[01:02:29.360 --> 01:02:35.520]  know like man join uh check out his youtube on friday nights we go live and and he like
[01:02:35.520 --> 01:02:40.640]  named strains and stuff so you get if you get on there and name a strain you get a bat
[01:02:40.640 --> 01:02:46.880]  you know what I mean one guy um named um this tricone rain with her r r a i n
[01:02:46.880 --> 01:02:53.920]  yep I thought about let's make it r e i g n tricone rain and uh the brother hit me with a
[01:02:53.920 --> 01:03:03.680]  pack so two it's love seat 2.219 times dipping sticks tricone rain so let's see uh 219 yeah so
[01:03:03.680 --> 01:03:08.320]  we give away we name two strains every friday and if you name the strain you get the pack
[01:03:08.880 --> 01:03:14.960]  so that's how that works and then um we also do clone giveaways uh sometimes we do raffles where
[01:03:15.040 --> 01:03:20.640]  if you buy seeds on boomfire.com um then you get a number and then you're entered into a raffle
[01:03:20.640 --> 01:03:25.760]  where we give away cuts actual rooted clones on the friday night live where we ship them to you
[01:03:26.480 --> 01:03:31.200]  so yeah you get you get all that fun stuff on friday night live that's on youtube on belief
[01:03:31.200 --> 01:03:35.600]  cannabis channel uh 8 p.m central standard time every friday so thanks for that shout as well
[01:03:36.720 --> 01:03:40.480]  yep we still got the uh the website in the background over there too so that's where you
[01:03:40.480 --> 01:03:48.240]  can grab the seeds boomfire.com www.boomfire.com you also have shirts there's socks um there's
[01:03:48.240 --> 01:03:54.560]  iphone cases lots of genetics uh the clones are currently listed as sold down there we're just
[01:03:54.560 --> 01:03:59.120]  trying to catch up with the demand right now um so if you have a special special need for clones
[01:03:59.120 --> 01:04:04.000]  you can definitely email us or or message us to the website but we've temporarily suspended
[01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:07.840]  clone sales on the website uh because we're trying to keep up trying to catch up
[01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:15.680]  do you have hoodies belief yep there's hoodies on the site bro all right yeah we just got the
[01:04:15.680 --> 01:04:20.640]  one style for now which is pretty dope we've got uh i got my girl working on some more uh
[01:04:20.640 --> 01:04:25.360]  some more styles so we're gonna be bringing out a bunch of new stuff we got some uh leggings for
[01:04:25.360 --> 01:04:30.000]  females there's tank tops on there now we're gonna be having hats and beanies on there real soon
[01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:34.160]  we're gonna have more and more of the apparel and stuff so people can live that belief lifestyle
[01:04:34.160 --> 01:04:39.440]  you know yeah man i think uh it says a lot when people are willing to wear your gear so
[01:04:40.160 --> 01:04:46.160]  absolutely it's an honor yeah super honored yeah man there's the site right there rasta
[01:04:47.280 --> 01:04:51.840]  yeah creature s1 seeds have been selling like hot cakes they're almost sold out
[01:04:51.840 --> 01:04:56.000]  there's not too many of those left so those should be grabbed while they can
[01:04:56.800 --> 01:05:02.800]  um i'll be making more but they'll be sold out soon the raisin brand is insane um that's the
[01:05:02.800 --> 01:05:08.640]  daily grape times the creature she's still available um 17 i don't think i have that many
[01:05:08.640 --> 01:05:15.200]  but yeah i have about that many uh left in stock probably about 12 i think but i'm sure it's close
[01:05:15.920 --> 01:05:21.280]  um yeah that that's fire bro uh the odo is sold out we're making another round of the odo
[01:05:21.360 --> 01:05:25.040]  because people were uh people were just emailing us all the time for her
[01:05:26.320 --> 01:05:31.920]  yeah that's a cool video that was from the event um imperious cannibal uh cannabis cannibal
[01:05:31.920 --> 01:05:39.600]  imperious cannabis uh we bring live clones rooted clones and tackle boxes like that sealed up so
[01:05:39.600 --> 01:05:43.920]  they're safe from getting uh contaminated from growers and then if you want to take some home
[01:05:43.920 --> 01:05:48.320]  you buy them and uh you're you know they're nice and clean they didn't get contaminated at the grow
[01:05:48.320 --> 01:05:52.800]  so we seal them up with tape and uh send them away rooted that's a really cool way to get some
[01:05:52.800 --> 01:05:58.000]  of our clones as you see us at any live events yep there's the hoodie phone case all that good
[01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:04.560]  apparel stuff you got the cool socks yeah we got the pomple moose which is the third coast belief
[01:06:05.120 --> 01:06:12.960]  uh collab which is the creature times um permission have you grown many of the um
[01:06:12.960 --> 01:06:19.280]  creature s1s believe i have i tested uh 25 of them myself before release what kind of stuff
[01:06:19.280 --> 01:06:22.880]  are you getting are they coming out looking like mama or what are they what are you getting out of
[01:06:22.880 --> 01:06:32.320]  that there is a very large variance of phenotypes in those packs they are all over the place so um
[01:06:33.520 --> 01:06:39.360]  out of the 20 of the ones that i flowered there was there was a couple that looked like her um
[01:06:39.920 --> 01:06:45.920]  you know the thing is with the creature line is about 75 of those plants the all the crosses in
[01:06:45.920 --> 01:06:51.760]  the creature line if you take them over day 70 they'll creach out too most of them like 70
[01:06:51.760 --> 01:06:58.080]  will creach out they just giving them more time that sativa genetic you know that that uh
[01:06:58.960 --> 01:07:04.400]  equatorial influence that they have in their genes you know with the long days of summer
[01:07:04.400 --> 01:07:11.520]  those long full days of sun they creach out after day 70 and they'll do all that funky stuff
[01:07:12.240 --> 01:07:18.400]  that they'll do so even you know the chimera she'll do it especially my pheno number two
[01:07:18.400 --> 01:07:23.600]  she'll definitely creach out after day 70 if you let her keep going um and a bunch of the other
[01:07:23.600 --> 01:07:30.160]  ones as well yeah so like um how so then if you have the time do you get more i mean does she get
[01:07:30.160 --> 01:07:35.040]  more complex as she starts creaching like you're getting more turps or you kind of still kind of
[01:07:35.040 --> 01:07:40.480]  locked in just growing wild on you yeah it's just growing wild like there's really no significant
[01:07:40.480 --> 01:07:46.320]  advantage to that unless you want to have a show bud that's just extraordinarily cool looking like
[01:07:46.320 --> 01:07:51.120]  a big old hand or something yeah you know that's the video but that's the content bud and then
[01:07:51.120 --> 01:07:56.240]  that's that's really it like you know unless you're doing fresh frozen and you have a whole room of it
[01:07:56.880 --> 01:08:00.400]  even then why would you take it over 100 days like the trichomes are already there
[01:08:01.200 --> 01:08:07.600]  they're going to go darker and darker the longer you go the creature does develop newer trichomes
[01:08:07.600 --> 01:08:11.840]  after 100 days though we saw newer trichomes developing and swelling that were clear
[01:08:12.400 --> 01:08:20.240]  after day 100 on the newer parts of the the foxtails so i mean
[01:08:20.240 --> 01:08:27.200]  is it worth the wait i don't think so there's not enough weight there to wait for in my opinion
[01:08:27.200 --> 01:08:32.720]  she's giving you most of everything you got at day 70 you might get three or four percent more
[01:08:32.720 --> 01:08:38.240]  you know over 40 days that's not a waste of time if you're growing commercially and you wanted weight
[01:08:39.440 --> 01:08:44.640]  i want to grow her outside that chimera one i think she'll be real good she's just a beast so
[01:08:44.640 --> 01:08:50.880]  huge man it's crazy very aggressive she was the most aggressive of the original four phenos that i
[01:08:50.880 --> 01:08:58.480]  kept um the smallest of the of the four in nugs your nugs look like they're a pretty nice size
[01:08:58.480 --> 01:09:04.480]  though um well that was the um truffle but yeah my kind of my chimera nugs are about like you know
[01:09:05.040 --> 01:09:10.560]  half a finger you know they're about that kind of small they're all consistently like that maybe a
[01:09:10.560 --> 01:09:18.320]  thumb you know yeah yeah yeah i call her the poor man's chimera yeah i love it though she's nice
[01:09:18.320 --> 01:09:24.400]  she smells uh and is just as trikey as you know number two and three uh my real real top shelf
[01:09:24.400 --> 01:09:30.720]  winners but uh she's just yeah it's magic you get that orange tic tac right in there yeah and i
[01:09:30.720 --> 01:09:34.960]  actually do like you get that taste like you had a glass of wine after you you know yeah
[01:09:35.360 --> 01:09:42.000]  okay yeah leaves that on the back end but um yeah she's nice and for the price man she was
[01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:46.800]  actually on your really your cheap clone list i mean i was amazed it was like you know really
[01:09:46.800 --> 01:09:52.160]  low at the time i know there's lots of jewels on my lower part of my chrome menu look if i have
[01:09:52.160 --> 01:09:57.120]  something there was four phenos there i put two of them on a ten thousand dollar menu one of them
[01:09:57.120 --> 01:10:02.080]  on the seventy five hundred dollar menu and the other one was like you know what not everybody
[01:10:02.080 --> 01:10:08.160]  has a huge budget bro so she's a smaller yielder i'm not gonna charge 5 000 or something that you
[01:10:08.160 --> 01:10:11.760]  know commercially i don't know you probably get a pound and a half you might be able to push her up
[01:10:11.760 --> 01:10:18.960]  to near two i think maybe if you grew really well and and you know got to know her um so you know
[01:10:18.960 --> 01:10:23.200]  give give people a good deal you know it's it's great for you know growers who are going to smoke
[01:10:23.200 --> 01:10:27.280]  their own and stuff like that we're not necessarily you know you need to hit that two or three pounds
[01:10:27.440 --> 01:10:33.520]  stay in business exactly because she is a very open structure so there's lots of space kind of
[01:10:33.520 --> 01:10:37.680]  in between her where you know you could be maximized so what i've been doing is i've been um
[01:10:38.240 --> 01:10:43.680]  you got a trainer man when she acts up so i've been kind of um staking the buds closer to bring
[01:10:43.680 --> 01:10:49.040]  her structure in you know and um it's been working out nice man gives other plants a little room when
[01:10:49.040 --> 01:10:55.040]  she tries to bully a little bit yeah she is a bully that's for that's for sure yeah that that
[01:10:55.040 --> 01:10:59.440]  comes from the creature man that's that that bully characteristic is definitely not from truffle
[01:10:59.440 --> 01:11:03.600]  truffle minds her own space you know she chills in her own little area she doesn't need to go
[01:11:03.600 --> 01:11:08.320]  looking around for the attention she'll get it you know the creature is going to get that attention
[01:11:08.320 --> 01:11:14.240]  no matter what she's going to demand your attention and she'll get it yeah true yeah she's a freak
[01:11:14.240 --> 01:11:17.920]  she's a freak but like i said i'm going to keep crossing things with the creature every time i
[01:11:17.920 --> 01:11:21.680]  find a fire winner i'm going to throw her in a creature room and we're going to creature line
[01:11:21.680 --> 01:11:26.960]  after creature line after creature line just to keep running it because she's so fire hey real
[01:11:26.960 --> 01:11:32.320]  quick belief so while i'm thinking about it a lot of people asked me um well they wanted me to ask
[01:11:32.320 --> 01:11:38.320]  you so do you keep mothers just long-term big old gnarly mothers or do you rotate out
[01:11:38.320 --> 01:11:45.040]  and and how do you keep your your lineage going we keep our mothers for about three months okay
[01:11:45.040 --> 01:11:51.360]  and then we phase them out yeah because we saw a lot of clones so our you know our main our main
[01:11:51.440 --> 01:11:56.000]  motivation would be to have fresh nice healthy thick clones for everybody um
[01:11:57.840 --> 01:12:02.240]  we really find that you know the first four or five poolings of clones is where
[01:12:02.240 --> 01:12:08.400]  you're most vigorous most healthy easiest to root thickest stem plants are just going to
[01:12:08.400 --> 01:12:15.200]  skyrocket that's where they come from after five six clonings you know i mean you definitely can
[01:12:15.200 --> 01:12:20.640]  do things to get that back but it's now you're in a little more of an uphill battle whereas if you
[01:12:20.640 --> 01:12:27.120]  just take a new girl who's already got that vigor you know she's going to get there quicker and
[01:12:27.120 --> 01:12:32.720]  easier i think that's a gold bar he said he takes you know four to six different cuts and then it's
[01:12:32.720 --> 01:12:37.600]  time to recycle they start losing that vigor and they get woody man you know it becomes harder on
[01:12:37.600 --> 01:12:42.560]  the farmer to get those clones because you got woody ass uh clones to work with so yeah i'm
[01:12:42.560 --> 01:12:46.960]  glad that someone like you said the same thing man it's good to know because um that's kind of
[01:12:46.960 --> 01:12:52.560]  how i've rolled too i i don't have success keeping those mothers very long you know what i mean i like
[01:12:52.560 --> 01:12:58.480]  to rotate them get the fresh girls up in there absolutely brother yeah no respect respect yeah
[01:12:58.480 --> 01:13:03.120]  i almost feel like it was you know when i was a lifeguard when i was younger everybody was
[01:13:03.680 --> 01:13:10.960]  talking about this purple dye so that people would pee you'd be out there all this is something
[01:13:10.960 --> 01:13:15.440]  it came out to be an urban legend i felt like with what you guys had just mentioned that that was also
[01:13:15.440 --> 01:13:19.680]  kind of like an urban legend like there was just so much aspects to it and i was wondering um
[01:13:20.800 --> 01:13:26.320]  if we could kind of dive deeper into ah fuck i lost my train of thought when yeah when my own
[01:13:26.320 --> 01:13:30.480]  shit popped up there i didn't hear your first part you kind of broke up on it would you say
[01:13:30.480 --> 01:13:33.920]  yeah i lost my train of thought too i was like shit i hope you fucking told me you're asking
[01:13:33.920 --> 01:13:37.920]  again at the end of this question because i'm gonna have to say what all right i might have
[01:13:37.920 --> 01:13:44.320]  to come back to that shit it was it was the dye in the pool that if you eat it would make a thing
[01:13:44.320 --> 01:13:49.440]  around you because i believe that one and then what did he say before that aspect because that's
[01:13:49.440 --> 01:13:54.960]  what i was trying to relate that to it was like an urban legend urban myth oh about the cloning so
[01:13:54.960 --> 01:14:00.160]  we were cutting right and so back in the day people would talk about oh i got this from an old
[01:14:00.160 --> 01:14:05.600]  head you know he's had the this mother for 15 years and i never really could understand that
[01:14:05.600 --> 01:14:09.840]  because like marco had mentioned like shit gets woody so how the hell would they be able to keep
[01:14:09.840 --> 01:14:15.520]  something healthy that long is that the the dye in the pool where everybody everybody talks about
[01:14:15.520 --> 01:14:20.720]  like it's real but no one's actually ever seen it that's a great question i actually want to know
[01:14:20.720 --> 01:14:26.000]  that too bro because back when i was in vegas i had this lemon skunk right las vegas lemon skunk
[01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:33.520]  from this old head who had this you know 25 year old mother plant so that's more specific when
[01:14:33.520 --> 01:14:39.360]  somebody says i've had this mother for 25 years they may be just not speaking specifically and
[01:14:39.360 --> 01:14:44.560]  maybe they just kept refreshing you know what i mean but these guys were saying no this guy's
[01:14:44.560 --> 01:14:51.040]  same plant 25 years he repots it every few months or twice a year whatever he does and he just keeps
[01:14:51.040 --> 01:14:55.920]  rolling with it okay so it's possible and it's definitely you can do that right you can do that
[01:14:56.560 --> 01:15:00.560]  i've never done that firsthand so i don't know i would think that you're going to get woody and
[01:15:00.560 --> 01:15:04.960]  woody and woody but check it out if you take that woody beast and you cut her down to like
[01:15:05.040 --> 01:15:09.520]  bottom node what's going to come up from there is going to be fresh new growth
[01:15:10.800 --> 01:15:16.240]  i just don't in personal experience i think there's a slight decline in that vigor
[01:15:16.960 --> 01:15:24.400]  so can you do it yeah definitely can you can you clone a fan leaf yeah but really why
[01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:32.400]  i mean when you work on your stuff yeah i mean 25 years i mean you can take do eight years bro
[01:15:32.400 --> 01:15:36.800]  and have a new mom you know like you're not going to lose the genetics you're not going to
[01:15:36.800 --> 01:15:41.680]  lose the power of that genetic if you do it a few times over a couple decades and if you're doing it
[01:15:41.680 --> 01:15:45.840]  over and over and over and over and over yeah there's gonna be some some decline in the strength
[01:15:45.840 --> 01:15:50.720]  of the genetic but it's uh you know it's going to be hundreds it's going to be over hundreds it's
[01:15:50.720 --> 01:15:55.120]  not going to be like i said i think i've gone like 70 or something like that you know where
[01:15:55.120 --> 01:16:00.080]  i actually counted so they're like the 70th generation of clones oh wow there was no decline
[01:16:00.640 --> 01:16:07.440]  so um real life talk right there you know real living experiences you're talking from that's the
[01:16:07.440 --> 01:16:12.880]  dope part about that right yeah not just what some guy told some guy who some guy told some guy
[01:16:12.880 --> 01:16:16.480]  from decades ago that you know who knows it's probably not even the same thing that was originally
[01:16:16.480 --> 01:16:20.000]  said so who knows if it could be true as i'm saying i want to write a book i want to go through all
[01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:26.240]  these things and just do real world tests side by side tests i want to show them on youtube and
[01:16:26.240 --> 01:16:31.280]  show them on instagram as we're doing them and then the conclusions can all be in the book
[01:16:31.280 --> 01:16:36.720]  because people have these different books on how to grow cannabis and they definitely are filled
[01:16:36.720 --> 01:16:41.520]  with lots of knowledge there's no doubt about that i read these books you guys have read these books
[01:16:41.520 --> 01:16:46.640]  but you'll find that you don't do everything in those books right you take the things that work
[01:16:46.640 --> 01:16:51.920]  for you and you make your own style your own unique style so there is something to be said
[01:16:51.920 --> 01:16:56.800]  for your own unique style but there's also something to be said for just pure science
[01:16:57.520 --> 01:17:03.600]  does everything else being the same does taking the families off really yield more now i've done
[01:17:03.600 --> 01:17:08.720]  a side by side and i can tell you absolutely it does when i take the families off at day one and
[01:17:08.720 --> 01:17:14.560]  day 21 and strip them down so there's no freaking families left at all anywhere on the plant they
[01:17:14.560 --> 01:17:19.200]  yield more i've seen that firsthand but there's other things that haven't been tested firsthand
[01:17:19.200 --> 01:17:25.040]  that i really want to test and i i think the jungle boys might have proved that with data
[01:17:25.040 --> 01:17:30.400]  you know they grow the way that they grow but they were able to to kind of show that because
[01:17:30.400 --> 01:17:36.480]  i believe they're super aggressive with defanning everything so again that was another thing back in
[01:17:36.480 --> 01:17:41.440]  the day where some people would say it worked some people didn't there was just all this noise
[01:17:42.080 --> 01:17:46.160]  back then so i'm glad that you're able to kind of just chop this stuff up with us today believe
[01:17:46.160 --> 01:17:51.680]  because like marcos got up there uh these gold bars could save a lot of time and effort from you
[01:17:51.680 --> 01:17:58.720]  just understanding what works and what doesn't true yeah i like that um that defoliation that
[01:17:58.720 --> 01:18:05.360]  you know and i and i do that too limited i don't i've never done the full strip but um i will try
[01:18:05.360 --> 01:18:10.720]  that now based on your your respect for what you're saying bro when you think you're done
[01:18:11.440 --> 01:18:18.640]  take more off okay i would say even then when you think you're done take more off just simply
[01:18:18.640 --> 01:18:24.640]  take everything off until there's nothing but branches and little tiny nodes with little tiny
[01:18:24.640 --> 01:18:31.680]  leaves everything off on day one day i was gonna say are you spacing that out or you're saying do
[01:18:31.680 --> 01:18:39.920]  all of that when you're defoiling that day all on day one and all on day 21 now so so just to be
[01:18:39.920 --> 01:18:49.280]  fully clear um have i done it on day you know 3 and 28 no have i done it on day 10 and 40
[01:18:49.280 --> 01:18:56.480]  no i've only done 1 and 21 so there's probably a better way but this way works better than
[01:18:56.480 --> 01:19:04.320]  taking no leaves off at all or taking some leaves off some of the time nice it just kind of echoes
[01:19:04.320 --> 01:19:09.520]  again some of the old beliefs like if it was a um if there was a nug there and the fan leaf was
[01:19:09.520 --> 01:19:15.200]  covering it well hey nug trumps fan leaf boom you either fold it down or pop it off and then
[01:19:15.200 --> 01:19:19.600]  there were like these purists that would come out and also be on overgrow and stuff and they'll talk
[01:19:19.600 --> 01:19:25.520]  about like no that's a solar panel for the plant it needs every single fan leaf to be able so it's
[01:19:25.520 --> 01:19:32.080]  extremely confusing again like just to kind of weed your way through this stuff uh and and i don't
[01:19:32.080 --> 01:19:37.040]  know it's just so confusing man so so for to have you not only be like obviously sharing your
[01:19:37.040 --> 01:19:41.120]  genetics with the world but also explaining especially to somebody new at this i don't
[01:19:41.120 --> 01:19:47.680]  think they understand uh how how potential they would have maybe being in their early 20s that
[01:19:47.680 --> 01:19:52.000]  kind of thing guy or girl figuring this stuff out you're going to have a lifetime of growing
[01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:57.520]  high-end cannabis without all of the real bullshit aspects that used to come with it when everybody
[01:19:57.520 --> 01:20:01.360]  was trying to figure it out and some people would share secrets some people would tell some shit
[01:20:01.360 --> 01:20:06.240]  that they were saying was a secret but it was actually i guess back and then trolling you know
[01:20:06.240 --> 01:20:13.200]  telling people to do certain things messing up their grows there's a lot of that too yeah i like
[01:20:13.200 --> 01:20:17.840]  that man and like like like y'all are saying man do what works for you try it you know give it a
[01:20:17.840 --> 01:20:22.000]  shot i'm looking in the chat somebody said yeah they do that but they leave just the top two nodes
[01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:26.560]  of leaves you know what i mean it's all about trying these things what works best for you for
[01:20:26.560 --> 01:20:31.520]  your style and what you're doing and probably a little bit strain related too i imagine you know
[01:20:31.600 --> 01:20:38.160]  the way you do the technique but definitely strain related yeah definitely day one and day day 21
[01:20:38.160 --> 01:20:44.000]  something to try see how it works and i i would say like a caveat with this would also be like
[01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:48.320]  you got to have your plants and your environment dialed in before you start messing around and
[01:20:48.320 --> 01:20:53.120]  stressing stuff out so when you first get into this just grow healthy plants and then maybe that
[01:20:53.120 --> 01:20:57.440]  second flip or third flip when it's really dialed in you're like almost kind of spinning your wheels
[01:20:57.440 --> 01:21:01.760]  right what else do i have to do now let's start kind of playing around stressing the plant
[01:21:01.760 --> 01:21:06.800]  uh dialing in you know your environment on just kind of that level two level three aspect
[01:21:07.520 --> 01:21:12.080]  yeah i think that's advisable for sure let's get it straight down you know when i just did another
[01:21:12.080 --> 01:21:18.080]  experiment i uh like a little experiment room i you know call my playroom i just do little
[01:21:18.080 --> 01:21:23.120]  experiments like this i had i just finished a run that uh that fall off for everybody or was that
[01:21:23.120 --> 01:21:34.720]  just me no i hear everything i'm good that was just you brad we good yeah brian earlier you were
[01:21:34.720 --> 01:21:41.520]  kind of uh losing signal earlier as well we got you now i can hear you or i can see you
[01:21:43.040 --> 01:21:49.040]  yeah you're good okay so where were you i'm sorry um uh shoot where were we talking about uh
[01:21:49.520 --> 01:21:53.600]  talking about a little strip and some leaves doing stuff that works for you
[01:21:54.320 --> 01:21:58.400]  little little tips and tricks yeah the playroom you were doing something new in the playroom
[01:21:58.400 --> 01:22:04.720]  so in the playroom um i just i i got a chop uh it's day 72 so i'm a couple days late on this job
[01:22:04.720 --> 01:22:11.040]  but i'm gonna shop uh probably later today i just grew out some plants in the eight inch by eight
[01:22:11.040 --> 01:22:18.160]  inch grow den blocks because uh i'm gonna be opening up a new facility here real soon uh 270
[01:22:18.160 --> 01:22:22.720]  lights and it's double stacked so we're gonna be doing it uh we're gonna do a side by side one
[01:22:22.720 --> 01:22:27.840]  one room 100 lights we're gonna do in the grow den blocks and then we're gonna do one room in
[01:22:27.840 --> 01:22:37.280]  the traditional uh peat moss um that i and cocoa that i use um so yeah i just wanted to you know
[01:22:37.280 --> 01:22:41.040]  get a little more experience with the grow den i've i've flowered in them you know i think once
[01:22:41.040 --> 01:22:47.040]  before um you know not really my my gig i like the more organic routine but i really wanted to get
[01:22:47.040 --> 01:22:52.720]  more experience and we we flowered under those and you know uh it worked out super well and you
[01:22:52.720 --> 01:22:55.760]  just got to constantly be experimenting for yourself you could definitely learn stuff from
[01:22:55.760 --> 01:23:00.720]  books but that first-hand knowledge of saying you know let's do it for myself you know an experiment
[01:23:00.720 --> 01:23:06.240]  takes what 70 days right how many 70 day segments do you got in your life like plenty of you're good
[01:23:06.240 --> 01:23:12.160]  like you can do these experiments while living and and growing and doing all this stuff i imagine
[01:23:12.160 --> 01:23:17.440]  that going to those grow dance probably for your team you know with the size and you trying to scale
[01:23:17.440 --> 01:23:23.200]  up probably will let you do some uh rotating a lot a lot quicker you know what i mean do you think
[01:23:23.200 --> 01:23:29.360]  that or is that kind of why you're doing a cleaner turnovers and just you know reset yeah yeah ease
[01:23:29.360 --> 01:23:34.640]  of operation you know those are the that building is going to be for flower production for the first
[01:23:34.640 --> 01:23:40.400]  run um and then we're going to do a massive phenol in that in that building uh but the first one can
[01:23:40.400 --> 01:23:46.400]  be a flower room so you know we just want you know something clean reliable a little easier uh
[01:23:46.400 --> 01:23:53.040]  and we really want to do our side by side in a big environment and see where you know what's up
[01:23:53.040 --> 01:24:00.000]  so for example i put four plants in these blocks and um white truffle is completely different she
[01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:04.000]  and i've experienced this as well from other facilities that i've toured that i've gotten
[01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:08.080]  the white truffle from me and growing her out and they said hey come take a look um so i've seen her
[01:24:08.080 --> 01:24:14.080]  grown out in grodan before uh under under the leds like this and she was very similar to what
[01:24:14.080 --> 01:24:21.280]  they grew up you know much tighter noders node spacing um much more bulbous cowlick structure
[01:24:21.920 --> 01:24:31.520]  um a little less trichome and a little less turf profile um on the grodan uh versus the the more
[01:24:31.520 --> 01:24:37.280]  natural soil type process um so with the soil you know little wider node spacing which can be
[01:24:37.280 --> 01:24:44.000]  heavily increased by getting her close to an led light but much more funk much more gassy truffle
[01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:55.840]  funk on the nose um in the soil and more trichomes and a more unique bud structure in particular with
[01:24:55.840 --> 01:25:02.400]  the calyxes uh being fatter and just more round instead of kind of bulbous and more shaped like a
[01:25:02.400 --> 01:25:08.720]  seed as a way they're coming out of uh of the grodan but on the other hand the gucci fruit was
[01:25:08.720 --> 01:25:14.400]  exactly the same she really well i'm gonna say that she lost a little turf profile gained a
[01:25:14.400 --> 01:25:20.400]  little size other than that she looked exactly the same trichome production was about exactly the same
[01:25:20.400 --> 01:25:27.760]  um her aggressive stature was the same the data number one was much smaller in size and much
[01:25:27.760 --> 01:25:36.400]  trickier with much less turps so it's going to be strain specific right but generally with those
[01:25:36.400 --> 01:25:42.400]  three plants with that little cross section generally we saw a loss in turps and an increase
[01:25:42.400 --> 01:25:49.840]  in production okay is this flower for resin or or hash or just flower for flowers this is yeah this
[01:25:49.840 --> 01:25:53.600]  is my little playroom so typically we're going to make fresh rose and all that stuff let's put in
[01:25:53.600 --> 01:26:00.720]  the freezer mix it up with a bunch of other stuff we make nice yeah yeah okay okay well they that i
[01:26:00.720 --> 01:26:04.720]  they still think that's a gold bar because you're doing side by sides and the soil is a little
[01:26:04.720 --> 01:26:10.880]  turpier so i love it the soil overall is turbier you couldn't argue with that on all those plants
[01:26:10.880 --> 01:26:17.520]  all of them yeah i've never uh used grodan is that like uh like a rock wool alternative like what is
[01:26:17.520 --> 01:26:22.960]  the yeah so it's just a brand of rock wool um it's just a brand walk well and these particular
[01:26:22.960 --> 01:26:28.080]  cubes were eight inch by eight inch and then they're wrapped in that plastic so we use the
[01:26:28.080 --> 01:26:34.240]  two inch for all of our cloning they're really clean and it's easy to work with with our cloning
[01:26:36.880 --> 01:26:41.760]  but uh yeah for for you know we go from the clones into the four inch pot in soil
[01:26:41.760 --> 01:26:47.600]  and then their soil from that point on go into the beds usually the lightest phenol in my beds
[01:26:47.600 --> 01:26:53.680]  we planted those seeds right in the raised beds and we're on day 27 without feeding
[01:26:54.720 --> 01:27:01.680]  so the raised beds you know they're they're three foot of soil and in order to germinate seeds
[01:27:01.680 --> 01:27:06.880]  you can't just water the top of that because all the water will wick out and they'll dry and die
[01:27:06.880 --> 01:27:10.960]  so if you're going to germinate and this wasn't there this wasn't their test that i wanted to do
[01:27:11.600 --> 01:27:18.720]  um i was doing a phenol hunt um usually you know we're using the the cup of water the paper towel
[01:27:18.720 --> 01:27:24.080]  the one inch pot the four inch pot routine i was like you know what i'm putting them right in the
[01:27:24.080 --> 01:27:29.520]  bed this time we're gonna cut out that whole process we're gonna cut out that whole rigamaro
[01:27:29.520 --> 01:27:34.000]  which is great if you had some super rare seeds and or if you only had 10 seeds and you really
[01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:40.000]  really really needed them that's more of an exacting procedure right but uh we were planting
[01:27:40.080 --> 01:27:46.400]  a thousand seeds and you know not that i don't care about them but again i have the chance to be
[01:27:46.400 --> 01:27:51.040]  more picky so if you can't come out of the dirt without you know assistance and an ambulance
[01:27:51.040 --> 01:27:55.040]  carrying you along the way then you're not going to be a winner here sorry if you need all our
[01:27:55.040 --> 01:27:59.840]  extra coaxing then you're not going to be a winner in this party and obviously when you do a big uh
[01:27:59.840 --> 01:28:05.360]  phenol hunt like that you're going with feminized seeds i do both bro yeah whatever do you i'll mix
[01:28:05.360 --> 01:28:11.280]  them in the room i don't care okay now when you know when you run both so do you send out for
[01:28:11.280 --> 01:28:15.600]  testing or you just do it the old-fashioned way and cut the males as you see old-fashioned way
[01:28:15.600 --> 01:28:24.160]  brother when when day 14 comes my my team and i were we're in there every day you know until day
[01:28:24.160 --> 01:28:33.840]  45 50 looking for herms all right so another gold bar from day 14 he starts looking up to day 45
[01:28:33.840 --> 01:28:38.400]  vigilant getting those males out of it out of there and that's not to say you're not going to
[01:28:38.400 --> 01:28:45.760]  have a herm after day 45 50 but the the chances drop significantly if she's going to herm it's
[01:28:46.400 --> 01:28:53.520]  98 percent of the time going to happen before that nice yeah and if you're if you're new to
[01:28:53.520 --> 01:28:59.120]  this then just take take a little bit of time to uh google what uh like cannabis balls look like
[01:28:59.120 --> 01:29:04.320]  because uh once you you know once you identify them it's going to be a lot easier as you see it
[01:29:04.320 --> 01:29:10.080]  time and time again to notice it sooner and sooner definitely and you know you can uh go to the
[01:29:10.080 --> 01:29:16.160]  belief cannabis uh belief takeover underscore instagram and we do um you know herm or no herm
[01:29:16.160 --> 01:29:20.560]  in our story it's a little game we like to play when we're at that point you know i'll just post
[01:29:20.560 --> 01:29:25.280]  pictures and i'll be like you know is it a herm or not and you know in the beginning i get at the
[01:29:25.280 --> 01:29:30.400]  beginning of the phenol it's easy because there's some that are just you know playing and playing as
[01:29:30.400 --> 01:29:37.520]  day herms early on you know really bad really bad girls um so they're easy and then i get progressively
[01:29:37.520 --> 01:29:41.760]  you know each phenol i get a little harder and harder by the time you know day 45 comes around
[01:29:41.760 --> 01:29:45.040]  you got bigger more mature flowers so it's going to be harder to find them and cite them at that
[01:29:45.040 --> 01:29:51.120]  time so it's a fun little game and then that people learn you know people some some you know
[01:29:51.680 --> 01:29:55.200]  newer breeders have been like fuck bro i'm lucky i'm seeing it i've never seen this like
[01:29:55.200 --> 01:30:00.160]  all the time like in this many detail this many different pictures and forms you know this is
[01:30:00.160 --> 01:30:07.040]  definitely helpful so we don't disclose the breeder um so nobody gets shamed we just we just
[01:30:07.040 --> 01:30:13.280]  show we just show the sexual organs and let people make up their own mind i feel like you know herms
[01:30:13.280 --> 01:30:20.240]  man is part of the game it's part of how everything gets better because you guys are pushing the
[01:30:20.240 --> 01:30:26.480]  limits on these genetics and combining things and seeing what works and just just throwing the books
[01:30:26.480 --> 01:30:32.240]  at things man so you so herms are gonna come to me i feel like that's just something that needs to
[01:30:32.240 --> 01:30:37.840]  be dealt with i think um i think shame on certain breeders and i don't know any but certainly if they
[01:30:37.840 --> 01:30:44.480]  do put out herms knowingly if they do put money before that quality because you know if you do
[01:30:44.480 --> 01:30:50.000]  that man you're gonna have a it's a ticking time bomb you know you're not gonna have that longevity
[01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:54.560]  and um and guy you know like belief i know i mean you know that you know like that's in any
[01:30:54.560 --> 01:30:59.600]  business you know qualities what's going to keep you there you know long term you can be fly by
[01:30:59.600 --> 01:31:06.000]  night make a quick car but uh if it doesn't run or doesn't hold up it's not gonna last so yeah
[01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:11.920]  rasta absolutely yeah i mean i think you know the two shameful things that a breeder would do in
[01:31:11.920 --> 01:31:20.160]  that situation is releasing something untested without stating it right like if you say look
[01:31:20.160 --> 01:31:26.720]  these are not tested buy at your own risk and they still decide to buy that's perfectly fine
[01:31:26.720 --> 01:31:32.800]  but if you release it and you don't state that and it's untested that's shameful unless you know
[01:31:33.360 --> 01:31:38.320]  unless you like unless you say it um and then again if you test it and find a high rate of
[01:31:38.320 --> 01:31:43.360]  herms and still release it those are the two thing other than that the breeder you can't be
[01:31:43.360 --> 01:31:48.000]  blaming a breeder for a herm here and there uh if a whole line if people are online saying you know
[01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:52.000]  this i bought this pack in a herm and there are guys like i bought it her and there are guys like
[01:31:54.160 --> 01:31:57.840]  that probably wasn't tested or it was tested and released anyways
[01:31:58.880 --> 01:32:04.720]  either way in that in that way the breeder would be to blame for that that's putting money above
[01:32:04.720 --> 01:32:09.840]  people and these people are out there growing you know it could be the hardcore cancer patient
[01:32:09.840 --> 01:32:14.960]  that needs their meds and doesn't have the money to go to a dispensary so they have to grow and
[01:32:14.960 --> 01:32:18.880]  they're depending on that grow and they have limits from some silly government that's telling
[01:32:18.880 --> 01:32:24.480]  how many plants they can grow so they're walking the edge of having enough meds and they get herms
[01:32:24.480 --> 01:32:32.800]  that's a problem bro that's a problem any commercial grower though i mean it's on you
[01:32:32.800 --> 01:32:37.200]  you're a commercial grower you're a professional if you're growing seeds you should be looking for
[01:32:37.200 --> 01:32:43.360]  herms of course the breeder should not be supplying herms but the grower also has the
[01:32:43.360 --> 01:32:49.120]  responsibility to make sure their plants are stable yeah because he's he's the master of that garden
[01:32:49.120 --> 01:32:54.560]  and belief is in oklahoma so now i have to be the one watching what's going on in this garden
[01:32:54.560 --> 01:32:57.280]  i mean i can come watch your garden you know we do consulting
[01:32:58.160 --> 01:33:05.520]  is there ever an instance where you would use herm pollen to do anything trying to keep anything
[01:33:05.520 --> 01:33:14.720]  going i have not heard i have not i mean well well yes and no i guess because of s1 kind of
[01:33:14.720 --> 01:33:18.560]  you got that in a way right right right so the you know all feminized lines you're going to be
[01:33:18.560 --> 01:33:23.280]  doing that on purpose but if it's like an accidental herm that occurred in a room
[01:33:23.360 --> 01:33:30.720]  would i use it would i take that and use it not unless it was a super fire plant and she hermed
[01:33:30.720 --> 01:33:35.840]  and i was going to use that for a project that so so i have two types of projects for breeding right
[01:33:36.720 --> 01:33:41.360]  one would be to release seeds to sell and the other one would be like sometimes i do lower
[01:33:41.360 --> 01:33:46.960]  branch projects where i just take one branch off a plant and i dust it and it's going to produce
[01:33:47.920 --> 01:33:52.320]  and i'm looking for now i'm looking for a clone only strain that i can sell as clone
[01:33:53.120 --> 01:33:58.320]  so i'm going to hunt through those any strain that doesn't pass testing because of herm rate
[01:33:58.320 --> 01:34:02.640]  which i have a couple of those laying around at thousands of seeds and stuff like that so i'm
[01:34:02.640 --> 01:34:07.920]  going to hunt through that so i know their herms i'll take that on i don't care i'll take that on
[01:34:07.920 --> 01:34:11.920]  and i'll take that on and i'll take that on and i'll take that on and i'll take that on and i'll
[01:34:12.480 --> 01:34:17.120]  so i'm going to hunt through that so i know their herms i'll take that on i don't care
[01:34:17.120 --> 01:34:22.080]  i'll take that on i'll find the winners and i'll sell those as clone only or if it's in high demand
[01:34:22.080 --> 01:34:27.920]  i can s1 that winner as well and people can still get a taste of that genetic so having a herm in a
[01:34:27.920 --> 01:34:31.120]  breeding line is not the end of the road as long as you know how to deal with it you got and you've
[01:34:31.120 --> 01:34:36.640]  got you know diversity in your game we're not just selling seeds you know we have the clones as well
[01:34:37.360 --> 01:34:41.360]  and we're soon going to be adding reg seeds because right now it's just fem seeds so we'll
[01:34:41.360 --> 01:34:46.400]  have reg some people only buy regs some people only buy femmes some people buy both so we want
[01:34:46.400 --> 01:34:50.000]  to have seeds for everybody we don't want that red guy out there you know saying hey i can't
[01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:53.600]  ever grow cannabis i'd like to grow up but he doesn't make any reg seeds so we want to make
[01:34:53.600 --> 01:34:58.560]  sure we supply that to people who want it so we have the clones you know we have the tissue culture
[01:34:58.560 --> 01:35:04.800]  lab is in is going to be uh up and coming soon it's in the works um so you know we want to cover
[01:35:04.800 --> 01:35:10.960]  in all bases not necessarily edibles yet but we want to be diversified you know clone sales
[01:35:11.360 --> 01:35:15.440]  you know like i said i halted the clone sales on the website because we're trying to catch up to
[01:35:15.440 --> 01:35:25.600]  what we have um you know that's great that's great because when we i can shut that off and that lack
[01:35:25.600 --> 01:35:30.480]  of revenue or that stop in revenue from that isn't going to affect me really because we got the seed
[01:35:30.480 --> 01:35:35.360]  sales going on and we got the consulting going on so we try to be diversified and now we got the
[01:35:36.080 --> 01:35:40.880]  we're putting more rooms up for flowers so we can supply more flowers to the people of oklahoma
[01:35:40.880 --> 01:35:44.720]  because that's the question we get all the time is where can we give belief flowers it's like i'm
[01:35:44.720 --> 01:35:50.320]  sorry you can't we don't really grow like that you know what i mean i think we talked about last time
[01:35:50.320 --> 01:35:56.000]  we we pheno how grow your own yeah you know grow your own get some belief genetics and get a clone
[01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:59.600]  and get it you know grow that stuff you know you could buy my recipe for my nutrients i use
[01:36:00.240 --> 01:36:04.400]  take it and just do all that and you know you're getting pretty close you know if you care about
[01:36:04.400 --> 01:36:08.880]  your plants and you care about the details if you care about your humidity and your temperature and
[01:36:08.880 --> 01:36:13.440]  your light you know and your dry backs and your ppms and your phs you're gonna do well
[01:36:14.480 --> 01:36:20.080]  you're gonna do well so damn man you're dropping lots of bars for me if you guys are trying just
[01:36:20.080 --> 01:36:25.200]  to get in the in the game get a foot in the game find a foothold he's saying so many things i love
[01:36:25.200 --> 01:36:31.200]  that just starting out the five-year plan the 10-year plan now coming with the diversifying
[01:36:31.200 --> 01:36:37.360]  everything he's doing so he's not only um depending on seeds or clones or you know and that kind of
[01:36:37.360 --> 01:36:42.000]  thing so man that much respect for that uh belief i think you're helping a lot of people if they're
[01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:46.880]  listening you know what i mean thank you ross dropping a lot of knowledge now one question i
[01:36:46.880 --> 01:36:56.080]  have let's say hypothetically um you you you have a you have a cut or or plant um clones you sell
[01:36:56.080 --> 01:37:02.320]  clones um is there do you have issues with people also selling your same clones because i see some
[01:37:02.320 --> 01:37:06.800]  of that coming up now lately and i'm just curious to know as a big dog in the game what do you think
[01:37:06.800 --> 01:37:10.880]  you know about that kind of stuff okay so it's interesting you brought that up yeah i just had an
[01:37:10.880 --> 01:37:15.600]  issue i had to address with a couple people in oklahoma that were selling my clones at a
[01:37:15.600 --> 01:37:23.920]  substantially lower price so uh i see you brad yeah so i just i i actually had to address that
[01:37:23.920 --> 01:37:30.800]  just recently uh with with three different farms um and they were they were receptive they were you
[01:37:30.800 --> 01:37:34.720]  know they two of them flat out agreed okay no problem i'll stop doing that i was like thank
[01:37:34.720 --> 01:37:39.280]  you very much i appreciate that you don't have to do that so i appreciate that um another guy you
[01:37:39.280 --> 01:37:44.560]  know we came to terms i guess like whatever and you know i don't have a contract with that guy
[01:37:45.200 --> 01:37:52.400]  um i didn't tell him a list of things to not do with my stuff and again i'm not the plant police
[01:37:52.400 --> 01:37:56.400]  i'm not going to be running around the industry telling people what they can do what they can't do
[01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:03.360]  but if you buy a ten thousand dollar cut and you're out there undercutting me on that
[01:38:05.120 --> 01:38:10.240]  i don't think that's moral i don't think it's more especially right away look if six months a
[01:38:10.240 --> 01:38:15.120]  year passes i'm dropping the price and you want to drop the price that's fine no problem
[01:38:15.120 --> 01:38:19.280]  the response usually is people say well i'm not belief i can't sell for ten thousand so i have to
[01:38:19.280 --> 01:38:24.000]  sell it for less i said well then don't sell it or go build your name so that you are somebody like
[01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:28.960]  belief and then you can sell for ten thousand but i did this for decades to get to that point
[01:38:28.960 --> 01:38:34.400]  so i kind of like to be respected in that regard um so if somebody buys my seeds they can do
[01:38:34.400 --> 01:38:40.960]  whatever they want i don't care right please go breed with them go for it please because it's fire
[01:38:40.960 --> 01:38:45.600]  i want everybody to have fire that helps my mission it's good go breed with them if somebody
[01:38:45.600 --> 01:38:50.880]  finds a fire cut as a clone for my seeds and they want to sell it please do that that's called return
[01:38:50.880 --> 01:38:56.640]  on investment people should be getting a return on their investment when they buy my seeds it
[01:38:56.640 --> 01:39:01.840]  shouldn't be throwing away two hundred dollars you should take that two hundred dollars and be
[01:39:01.840 --> 01:39:07.600]  able to make a hundred thousand dollars this is the way i see it so go do that go breed with it
[01:39:07.600 --> 01:39:12.240]  you find a winner you want to s1 it do that go ahead i'm not going to be pissed about that
[01:39:12.960 --> 01:39:17.040]  copycat did that with the white truffle not that i've read the white truffle but i'm kind of like
[01:39:17.040 --> 01:39:24.160]  a co-parent you know i mean i don't care who cares copycat's audience is because it's his
[01:39:24.160 --> 01:39:29.280]  audience because of his hustle i don't have anything to do with his hustle he can do whatever
[01:39:29.280 --> 01:39:39.680]  he wants is it would i do it no do i find it to be moral no who cares it's his life it's his business
[01:39:40.320 --> 01:39:46.000]  if there's people who want to buy it and he's supplying it then he can do what he wants i don't
[01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:51.760]  agree with it if i if i had a magic wand to make him stop doing that i don't know if i'd want that
[01:39:51.760 --> 01:39:55.760]  responsibility i'd probably wave it i'd probably say you know make your own stuff or something like
[01:39:55.760 --> 01:40:01.200]  that but i'm not and i don't have time for that and nor does anybody i think if you're more focused
[01:40:01.200 --> 01:40:06.000]  on your hustle than worrying about what somebody else is doing you're going to find what you want
[01:40:06.640 --> 01:40:11.680]  so i mean as a businessman though i'm not going to have somebody selling my ten thousand dollar
[01:40:11.680 --> 01:40:19.280]  cuts for ten dollars that has happened that has happened so we actually i actually got with my
[01:40:19.280 --> 01:40:24.560]  lawyer and i'm i have a contract now if you buy something over a thirty five hundred dollar cut
[01:40:24.560 --> 01:40:28.800]  you're welcome to sell it if you'd like but you have to sell it the same price as i'm selling
[01:40:29.760 --> 01:40:35.760]  boom that's fair that's fair and just just because the chat's going off i mean we get a we get a lot
[01:40:35.760 --> 01:40:43.120]  of people that don't have that big mind that open mind where you can see the whole world and you
[01:40:43.120 --> 01:40:48.080]  just see ten thousand dollar cut and you can't go past that like the reason that is is man we're
[01:40:48.080 --> 01:40:53.600]  talking about exclusivity we're talking about if you're up on that list of ten thousand and
[01:40:53.600 --> 01:40:58.400]  this man is saying you're going to be one of very few to even have this now think about that if you're
[01:40:58.400 --> 01:41:05.280]  one of very few to have this you have a commercial facility now you run this when that shit hits the
[01:41:05.280 --> 01:41:11.200]  dispensary or however you're selling it you're selling out so you're thinking ten thousand when
[01:41:11.200 --> 01:41:16.960]  you should be thinking a hundred thousand or a million you know and that's kind of why um that's
[01:41:16.960 --> 01:41:20.880]  i think that's and you can elaborate on that belief but i feel like that's what you're getting
[01:41:20.880 --> 01:41:29.040]  with that um you know with that price point definitely and you know there's the hype there
[01:41:29.040 --> 01:41:36.400]  of course and hype sells in this industry but the hype is on on a foundation of fire right it's on a
[01:41:36.400 --> 01:41:41.200]  foundation of large phenyl humps it's on a foundation of over and over and over and over again
[01:41:41.760 --> 01:41:48.080]  um so you know the contract is really simple look just if you're buying this cut in order to protect
[01:41:48.080 --> 01:41:55.760]  your interest as a buyer and my interest as the breeder or the pheno hunter um let's just have an
[01:41:55.760 --> 01:42:01.120]  agreement that we're not going to spread it all around it's that simple and and we're constantly
[01:42:01.120 --> 01:42:06.160]  pheno hunting so in six months it's a total different story in 12 months it's a totally
[01:42:06.160 --> 01:42:10.880]  different story you know look at runs like it's super famous one day and then people are hating
[01:42:10.880 --> 01:42:15.760]  on the next day blue dream saying it's going to continue to happen over and over and over again
[01:42:16.320 --> 01:42:23.440]  it's silly but it is what people do um so the way we stay ahead of that and not worry about that kind
[01:42:23.440 --> 01:42:29.120]  of stuff is we just keep breeding new fire stuff and improving our craft and giving people the best
[01:42:29.120 --> 01:42:34.320]  of the best so it's not really a concern it's more in the rear view um but i think that there should
[01:42:34.320 --> 01:42:38.880]  be some kind of respect there hey i'm not going to take your cut and sell it now for that much
[01:42:39.040 --> 01:42:47.760]  less you know what i mean but then there's the added there's the added um issue if somebody buys
[01:42:47.760 --> 01:42:58.560]  a cut from me for 10 000 and then let's say like that person sells it to another guy for 10 000
[01:42:58.560 --> 01:43:04.480]  okay so he's within my contract and he's fine that second person that bought it for 10 000 let's say
[01:43:04.480 --> 01:43:11.120]  they drop the price to 20 bucks i have no contract with that person so i'm not going to go
[01:43:11.120 --> 01:43:17.600]  chasing that person that person has no obligation to me whatsoever they don't know me they didn't
[01:43:17.600 --> 01:43:23.600]  make a contract with me the only obligation that i'd hope they'd realize is a business obligation
[01:43:23.600 --> 01:43:29.040]  to maintain the value of that clone and not to also sell it short because if they pay 10 000
[01:43:29.040 --> 01:43:34.000]  they now have a vested interest in the value remaining high of that clone but if they're a
[01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:40.960]  big nursery that can make a hundred thousand for selling it for 10 bucks a piece then their value
[01:43:40.960 --> 01:43:48.400]  is on the 10 clone their value is to sell it so there has been that that has occurred as well
[01:43:49.120 --> 01:43:54.000]  again it's too far for me to chase that stuff i really don't care if people text me like hey this
[01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:58.560]  guy's selling your 10 000 for 20 bucks i'm going to contact that person say you know will you please
[01:43:58.560 --> 01:44:04.720]  not do that that's it that's the end of it if they say you know forget you bro i'll be like all
[01:44:04.720 --> 01:44:08.960]  right well have a good day i wish you wouldn't do it but i can't control you i'm not going to go
[01:44:08.960 --> 01:44:13.520]  mafia style i have guys go um goons go knocking people's doors down you know what i mean what am
[01:44:13.520 --> 01:44:18.080]  i gonna do i'm gonna be a gangster now go get a gun and threaten somebody like what am i gonna
[01:44:18.080 --> 01:44:22.160]  call the cops like what am i supposed to do like sometimes you can't control things you just gotta
[01:44:22.160 --> 01:44:27.920]  let it go it's called life yes sir hey well let me on that same line sorry brian but i want to stay
[01:44:27.920 --> 01:44:33.920]  on that um so you talked to legal is there is there ever a way you think there would be a way
[01:44:33.920 --> 01:44:42.320]  that people could um trademark genetics or patent or lock that into where i don't i own it well
[01:44:42.320 --> 01:44:48.960]  that's happening already monsanto has successfully done that to a certain extent um the way that the
[01:44:48.960 --> 01:44:55.360]  way that we're looking moving forward is looking at more of a dna analysis and a certification that
[01:44:55.360 --> 01:45:02.080]  comes from the dna analysis so that if i have a 10,000 dollar cut i can post that dna analysis or
[01:45:02.080 --> 01:45:09.120]  make that available to people um in some public arena where if somebody buys that cut from somebody
[01:45:09.120 --> 01:45:13.680]  else and wants to verify it or before they verify you know before they buy it they want to verify
[01:45:13.680 --> 01:45:17.840]  they can compare that analysis that they've done independently with the one that we've had done
[01:45:17.840 --> 01:45:24.560]  and that would certify that that's the right cut that that's the cut so um i'm not sure about on
[01:45:24.720 --> 01:45:33.200]  you know i don't know um yeah i'm not sure how it goes but we'll see in the future i mean that's
[01:45:33.200 --> 01:45:38.720]  what we're looking at doing now um federal legalization can probably bring more opportunity
[01:45:38.720 --> 01:45:43.680]  for for a trademark something like that i think that's coming in the future brian's trying to talk
[01:45:43.680 --> 01:45:47.360]  about two minutes now yeah belief i just wanted to give you the opportunity to talk about well
[01:45:47.360 --> 01:45:52.080]  okay then what makes a ten thousand dollar cut uh compared to the others in your mind you know
[01:45:52.080 --> 01:45:58.240]  you're doing all this homework you've been doing it for decades okay so the customer knows from at
[01:45:58.240 --> 01:46:03.760]  least from your mouth today like what makes that an elite elite cut that you feel like that's a
[01:46:03.760 --> 01:46:09.200]  fair price for it good question that's an amazing question i wish people would ask this more because
[01:46:09.200 --> 01:46:12.480]  i think they're intimidated and maybe they think there's no answer they're going to put me in some
[01:46:12.480 --> 01:46:20.000]  kind of tough situation it goes back to the amount of seeds that we're hunting and the grading scale
[01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:27.760]  right so i'm always looking at selling these cuts as a return the potential return on investment for
[01:46:28.320 --> 01:46:33.360]  the the buyer so i'm not going to sell something to any buyer where they're not going to be able
[01:46:33.360 --> 01:46:40.560]  to make the money back and then some right so when people tell me i want to come buy some more
[01:46:40.560 --> 01:46:45.440]  chimera from you the cuts i had last time turned out great i took it to the dispensary it sold
[01:46:45.440 --> 01:46:52.160]  quickly okay then i have another guy who calls me and says hey i need to get that white truffle or i
[01:46:52.160 --> 01:46:58.720]  need to get some chimera or i need to get that data because i'm continuing to take this sfvog
[01:46:58.720 --> 01:47:03.200]  to the dispensary and they don't buy it anymore because the demand is not there it's not hype
[01:47:03.200 --> 01:47:07.280]  anymore it's not popular the demand is not there people aren't asking for it and when i put it on
[01:47:07.280 --> 01:47:13.840]  the shelves it doesn't sell so there's the start of the return on investment right there can you
[01:47:13.840 --> 01:47:18.800]  walk into a dispensary in oklahoma this is what happens because this is where we're based and we
[01:47:18.800 --> 01:47:26.240]  deal with a lot of commercial cultivators um with clone sales they've told me over and over again
[01:47:26.240 --> 01:47:33.920]  when i walk in the dispensary with your genetics they sell when i don't they don't all things being
[01:47:33.920 --> 01:47:41.120]  the same product being the same grower being the same the name has hype right the name has
[01:47:41.120 --> 01:47:48.000]  credibility the name has integrity in the industry so people have seen that they felt that
[01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:52.480]  and they've had that that's the confidence that we have as a business to say people are going to
[01:47:52.480 --> 01:47:58.960]  enjoy that so that's the start of the roi now when when i first started phenol hunting before i had
[01:47:58.960 --> 01:48:07.280]  ten thousand dollar cuts um you know we were selling we're selling cuts for 20 bucks and then
[01:48:07.280 --> 01:48:13.600]  i found something better than that so it was worth more and people paid it and they they took
[01:48:13.600 --> 01:48:19.680]  it and they grew it and they enjoyed it and they came back for more so the roi was there versus the
[01:48:19.680 --> 01:48:24.880]  20 cut so then i started doing bigger and bigger phenol hunts and the bigger the phenol hunts got
[01:48:24.880 --> 01:48:32.160]  the more picky i could be about the selections i made so those cuts that were 20 dollar menu
[01:48:32.160 --> 01:48:38.560]  20 dollar items when i first got started were no longer being selected they were being called out
[01:48:38.560 --> 01:48:46.960]  and i was picking better genetics so better genetics is is really the question when you
[01:48:46.960 --> 01:48:51.680]  have better genetics when we saw the plants that have been shown on here that that kool-aid man
[01:48:52.400 --> 01:48:58.080]  is that going to sell for more than the sfv og that people have been growing forever i mean could
[01:48:58.080 --> 01:49:03.040]  be that the cooling man has grown poorly and the sfv has grown better in that case the sfv would
[01:49:03.040 --> 01:49:10.080]  sell but the vast majority of the time that new fire hype is going to sell and that's what it is
[01:49:10.640 --> 01:49:16.960]  it's it's hype because it's that good there's a lot of times hype is because it's good
[01:49:18.080 --> 01:49:24.480]  usually you know hype can't stand up if it's not good if if they released runs and said this is the
[01:49:24.480 --> 01:49:31.360]  best new thing we got and it was boof people would reject it it has to be good hype can be
[01:49:31.360 --> 01:49:37.280]  short-lived like marco was saying earlier a fly by night hype that that could be fake but that long
[01:49:37.280 --> 01:49:44.080]  live type that cookies cookies is still grown you know those cuts those original cookies cuts are
[01:49:44.080 --> 01:49:52.400]  still freaking grown they're still used for crosses they've stood the test of time so the ri continues
[01:49:52.800 --> 01:50:00.320]  return on investment continues that that value in in the clones continues at the dispensary when you
[01:50:00.320 --> 01:50:08.080]  go to sell it so the higher up you go in the menu you're going to be more and more chance of it being
[01:50:08.720 --> 01:50:16.480]  a big producer right so like i said the chimera one she's super fire super dank i put her on the
[01:50:16.480 --> 01:50:23.200]  low menu because she's not a big producer she doesn't justify the ten thousand dollar price tag
[01:50:24.880 --> 01:50:29.680]  a grower a commercial grower is not going to be able to take her into a commercial environment
[01:50:29.680 --> 01:50:34.960]  and grow more than they would have grown or better than they would have grown necessarily well
[01:50:34.960 --> 01:50:39.600]  they're going to go better maybe not more than they would have grown versus some other strain
[01:50:40.560 --> 01:50:49.680]  but when you get a 10 000 cut it has this balancing of extreme high uh yield and extremely
[01:50:49.680 --> 01:50:56.880]  high quality and like the dip and sticks isn't the extreme high side of yield but on quality she is
[01:50:57.760 --> 01:51:04.640]  the chimera is all the way up chimera number two and number three all the way up all the way up to
[01:51:04.640 --> 01:51:14.640]  the top on yield and quality it's the some of the best cannabis i've ever grown hands down i like her
[01:51:14.640 --> 01:51:20.480]  better than truffle she's better than truffle the tests say so my nose says so my effect says so the
[01:51:20.480 --> 01:51:27.680]  people say so and truffle is hype is crazy so then she's worth more than truffle right if it's better
[01:51:27.680 --> 01:51:32.720]  than the other one it's worth more how do they justify the price of a lamborghini versus a ford
[01:51:32.720 --> 01:51:39.280]  escort well the lamborghini is better boom the lamborghini is better and if it wasn't
[01:51:39.280 --> 01:51:42.720]  lamborghini would not sell any lamborghinis and they would go out of business
[01:51:44.880 --> 01:51:51.040]  ten thousand dollar cuts were not a thing people would stop buying them commercial cultivators come
[01:51:51.040 --> 01:51:56.720]  to me time after time after time and say what's the newest greatest ten thousand dollar cut you
[01:51:56.720 --> 01:52:02.560]  have oh and by the way do you have any twenty thousand dollar cuts do you have anything better
[01:52:02.560 --> 01:52:10.480]  than this what am i going to do i'm going to go make bigger pheno hunts i'm going to go find a
[01:52:10.480 --> 01:52:15.520]  twenty thousand dollar cut that's what i'm going to do i'm going to fill that need and those clients
[01:52:15.520 --> 01:52:20.640]  and those people who smoke it are going to be in heaven thanks to the man who had balls to stand up
[01:52:20.640 --> 01:52:25.680]  and say i'm going to invest in myself i'm going to invest in my patients i'm going to invest in my
[01:52:25.680 --> 01:52:30.800]  clients i'm going to buy them the best that they can be just like lamborghini would go by the best
[01:52:30.800 --> 01:52:35.520]  tires they can put on their lap they're not going to put some cheesy tires on our car so if you want
[01:52:35.520 --> 01:52:39.280]  the best for your clients you're going to be willing to shell out that money and now if you
[01:52:39.280 --> 01:52:45.440]  take that ten thousand dollar cut and you grow hundreds of them and you go over and over and
[01:52:45.440 --> 01:52:53.680]  over again how much did it cost you per plant boom that's what i was literally about to say
[01:52:53.680 --> 01:52:58.240]  belief like if you're buying a if you're buying a lamborghini with the way that the plant works
[01:52:59.040 --> 01:53:04.960]  you know whatever your price range is and you get to make the lamborghini time and again
[01:53:04.960 --> 01:53:09.360]  with with tried and true genetics that you and your team have personally run through
[01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:16.000]  and maybe maybe that wasn't explained especially at the beginning for a lot of a lot of individuals
[01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:22.560]  of what some breeders do and put in the work while others like you had mentioned probably
[01:53:22.560 --> 01:53:26.480]  just breed too quickly you try to put out so much stuff that there's no way they actually did
[01:53:26.480 --> 01:53:33.360]  the homework so the consumer feels that especially at the commercial level i think that's why yourself
[01:53:33.360 --> 01:53:39.600]  and other breeders really stand out to the tried and true community because behind the scenes
[01:53:39.600 --> 01:53:44.720]  like you had mentioned they gotta they gotta make the numbers and they have to get that bag appeal
[01:53:44.720 --> 01:53:50.560]  so they're constantly on the hunt man i mean that's the feno hunt is kind of the same way as
[01:53:50.560 --> 01:53:54.320]  like writing new songs or you know whatever analogy you want to use you have to stay
[01:53:55.120 --> 01:54:00.560]  hype you have to stay relevant you have to stay in the in the community's mind and that's why
[01:54:01.440 --> 01:54:07.760]  hats off to you again man with the just the perpetual ideas that you had from not only
[01:54:07.760 --> 01:54:12.800]  starting with the best stock but building up and having the time to really think of it like best
[01:54:12.800 --> 01:54:19.920]  moves almost like street moves with the dominance of of your stable i mean that's what it's really
[01:54:19.920 --> 01:54:25.840]  about as a breeder i would think is having the best stable showing off the prettiest girls uh
[01:54:25.840 --> 01:54:31.120]  you know in your neighborhood yeah rasta absolutely and you know that's not to say we
[01:54:31.120 --> 01:54:34.880]  don't have love for the people who don't have a budget you know we have a 20-dollar clone meal
[01:54:34.880 --> 01:54:41.040]  menu here in oklahoma and some of the stuff on that 20-dollar menu was previously in a 7500
[01:54:41.040 --> 01:54:47.600]  price range why did it go down to 20 because i've had her long enough the hype has kind of run out
[01:54:47.600 --> 01:54:52.000]  the people have her i'm not stupid i know somebody else has sold her for less money by now
[01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:58.800]  you know what i mean let the people have her the ice cream cake on my on my 20-dollar menu is insane
[01:54:58.800 --> 01:55:05.360]  bro i got that absolutely insane and the reason i put it on that 20-hour mini is because i didn't
[01:55:05.360 --> 01:55:10.480]  hunt that heavily uh connected hunted that gifted it to me he's got something right there you know
[01:55:10.560 --> 01:55:18.560]  that's fire bro that's insane if quality alone was what you're looking at and you were in a room
[01:55:18.560 --> 01:55:22.640]  and you never knew anything about the cannabis industry or anything about trends and you took
[01:55:22.640 --> 01:55:26.960]  the ice cream cake and you took the white truffle and you took the chimera and you had 100 people
[01:55:26.960 --> 01:55:32.960]  some of them would pick each one of those jars so that means that somebody would prefer an ice
[01:55:32.960 --> 01:55:39.440]  cream cake cut to a chimera when the chimera is on my 10 000 menu and the ice cream cake is on the
[01:55:39.440 --> 01:55:46.240]  20-dollar menu in town i've had more than one person say that ice cream cake is like their
[01:55:46.240 --> 01:55:52.240]  daily deal they have so many choices and that's their daily their deal man but look i look at it
[01:55:52.240 --> 01:55:56.400]  like this man a lot of people don't think about it like coming up you know being a little bit
[01:55:57.120 --> 01:56:01.360]  older like man like when your mom had a refrigerator right you had that refrigerator
[01:56:01.360 --> 01:56:06.560]  your whole life it seemed like you know what i mean and it lasted right what happened was the
[01:56:06.560 --> 01:56:11.680]  refrigerator companies started cheapening the parts so you'd have to buy more refrigerators
[01:56:11.680 --> 01:56:19.760]  right they put products out now for us to test the consumer test them what you get with your
[01:56:19.760 --> 01:56:25.520]  stuff belief is you did the work you've got the product fully tested so when i get it i know it
[01:56:25.520 --> 01:56:32.880]  works and instead of the way the industry is and most products are now is build something for a
[01:56:32.880 --> 01:56:39.360]  certain period of time you know so what i'm trying to get at is the mindset like it's more of a you
[01:56:39.360 --> 01:56:45.760]  do the work you put the hustle in you grind and then you reap benefits whereas a lot of your lower
[01:56:45.760 --> 01:56:52.240]  price um or or or some some approaches different business approaches maybe just to put it out for
[01:56:52.240 --> 01:56:56.720]  the masses and they end up doing more of the testing for you kind of giving feedback so i
[01:56:56.720 --> 01:57:02.320]  don't know i feel like that i like that i appreciate that more that you know you do that work because i
[01:57:02.320 --> 01:57:07.040]  always like to let the pros do their job you know what i mean like if i'm going to be building a
[01:57:07.040 --> 01:57:12.160]  building the electrician knows a lot more about electricity than the glass man so you know what i
[01:57:12.160 --> 01:57:17.120]  mean and so as a breeder that's why i look to somebody like you and i'm going to grow your
[01:57:17.120 --> 01:57:23.440]  stuff because you put in that work i don't have i don't have the time to hunt all this per se you
[01:57:23.440 --> 01:57:28.480]  know i want to do smaller hunts you know and and be more successful those smaller hunts so i think
[01:57:28.480 --> 01:57:33.120]  that's where um you know that's where your work's appreciated and that's where i think people should
[01:57:33.120 --> 01:57:38.560]  look more uh more too when they're thinking about your stuff yeah i appreciate that man we see the
[01:57:38.560 --> 01:57:46.320]  same way definitely the only business is repeat business that was our mantra man uh the only way
[01:57:46.320 --> 01:57:50.320]  to get people to come back so when you were even mentioning the customer service aspect
[01:57:50.960 --> 01:57:55.440]  uh i mean how how else could you do it you know i mean there's just you got to build a brand you
[01:57:55.440 --> 01:58:00.160]  got to have people talking about your stuff and then you put the time and effort into it and one
[01:58:00.160 --> 01:58:05.760]  day people want to wear your t-shirts and hats and stuff because it it means something to them i mean
[01:58:05.760 --> 01:58:09.760]  there's there's something in branding there's something in marketing we've seen that time and
[01:58:09.760 --> 01:58:14.880]  time again so if you have the if you have that lamborghini product and you have the marketing and
[01:58:14.880 --> 01:58:21.440]  branding aspect to that you know then paying paying whatever you feel comfortable with to
[01:58:21.440 --> 01:58:26.400]  start off with high end maybe you don't need the lamborghini startup but you want to buy uh that
[01:58:26.400 --> 01:58:32.720]  mercedes-benz aspect um but then you get to multiply mercedes-benz's in your facility you
[01:58:32.720 --> 01:58:37.040]  know so then you have just this huge thing of mercedes-benz rocking make your money with that
[01:58:37.040 --> 01:58:43.280]  hey the next move maybe maybe it's a porsche and you move yourself up on that aspect um and again
[01:58:44.080 --> 01:58:49.440]  this from a basement aspect um hunting seeds in 2022
[01:58:51.920 --> 01:58:57.520]  you almost are working with only high-end uh cars we're continuing with that analogy it doesn't
[01:58:57.520 --> 01:59:03.040]  really seem like the as long as you're smart with your money and do and do some basic research
[01:59:03.760 --> 01:59:08.000]  there's really nobody that's surviving after a few years that's putting out like
[01:59:08.560 --> 01:59:14.160]  you know just bullshit cars that that aren't going to run well um most individuals are putting out
[01:59:14.160 --> 01:59:18.480]  some pretty high-end stuff and then it's up to you uh you know with what you want to what you
[01:59:18.480 --> 01:59:23.440]  want to run through and the clone aspect i like because you can you can build a brand from that
[01:59:23.440 --> 01:59:29.040]  almost especially if you know and then while you're making money doing that and building up
[01:59:29.040 --> 01:59:32.640]  your facilities because that's usually kind of how it works right you're trying to make his
[01:59:32.640 --> 01:59:37.680]  the best money you you know more from a yield standpoint of what she's going to provide
[01:59:37.920 --> 01:59:42.400]  a lot of these individuals in oklahoma that's kind of what more we were consulting with is
[01:59:42.400 --> 01:59:46.960]  they all wanted to run from from seed they all you know which sounds great in theory
[01:59:47.600 --> 01:59:51.600]  but then you don't necessarily know what the yields there's just too many variables
[01:59:51.600 --> 01:59:56.240]  when you're really trying to put the numbers together so the clone makes sense from that
[01:59:56.240 --> 02:00:01.760]  aspect and then you're getting the the knowledge and stuff as as you're farming uh to really take
[02:00:01.760 --> 02:00:06.560]  it to the next level which is pheno hunting and that's also again how you're going to be able to
[02:00:06.560 --> 02:00:13.200]  to really brand yourself but from you know from the from the car standpoint having a variety of
[02:00:13.200 --> 02:00:16.880]  different things out there so then you got the lamborghini you got the mercedes you got the
[02:00:16.880 --> 02:00:22.320]  the high-end bmws uh and then you can let the consumer pick but they're at least allowed to
[02:00:22.320 --> 02:00:26.240]  know that this stuff is high-end and you can tell the difference i mean there's a difference
[02:00:26.240 --> 02:00:31.440]  between driving a toyota and a high-end car you know there's just a difference in that and so
[02:00:32.320 --> 02:00:38.960]  some people like that and some people don't you know don't but from my experience man especially
[02:00:38.960 --> 02:00:44.000]  from the underground stuff the people that have have money that have wealth not you know they
[02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:50.560]  have real wealth where it doesn't like the money aspect doesn't really even concern them that that
[02:00:50.560 --> 02:00:55.440]  market will always be there and so if you can find that especially on the commercial side of things
[02:00:55.440 --> 02:01:00.880]  as a dispensary where you are really reaching the doctor and lawyer type individuals the
[02:01:00.880 --> 02:01:06.720]  entrepreneur just successful minded individuals that might know how long it takes to do certain
[02:01:06.720 --> 02:01:13.120]  things the money will always be there for you if that's where your goal is and i think more
[02:01:13.120 --> 02:01:17.200]  individuals should take that approach like mr belief here where it's like i got a five-year
[02:01:17.200 --> 02:01:22.480]  plan i got a 10-year plan and then once that comes into fruition it's going to be pretty hard to catch
[02:01:22.480 --> 02:01:33.920]  up i agree absolutely yeah man it's uh and also you know things that may may uh maybe not overstood
[02:01:33.920 --> 02:01:40.080]  by people who haven't grown in a large commercial environment and done large phenol is there's a
[02:01:40.080 --> 02:01:46.320]  very large cost with doing a large phenol so for example in a phenol where there's you know we did
[02:01:47.040 --> 02:01:54.400]  2 000 seeds right 2 500 seeds and about 1700 harvested that was a 35 light room so when we're
[02:01:54.400 --> 02:02:02.400]  done with a phenol hunt 97 98 of those plants are not winners so what do we do with that
[02:02:04.720 --> 02:02:11.920]  we have a 35 lighter that we just grew 50 pounds or so and we have 50 pounds of bud
[02:02:11.920 --> 02:02:20.000]  that really isn't sellable except for the winners so three percent so you've got maybe
[02:02:20.000 --> 02:02:24.400]  a quarter ounce of this plant a half ounce of this plant an ounce of this plant maybe a qp of
[02:02:24.400 --> 02:02:31.440]  this plant of the winners and that's it the rest of it is stuff that myself i would not release as
[02:02:31.440 --> 02:02:38.640]  flower grown by belief because it doesn't it's not by standards so i have a 35 lighter if i would
[02:02:38.640 --> 02:02:45.360]  have planted chimera three in there i'm gonna get my three pounds plus a light right that's 100
[02:02:45.360 --> 02:02:52.320]  pounds 100 pounds of chimera times x dollars is a shit ton of cash that i'm not gonna get
[02:02:53.440 --> 02:02:59.600]  because i decided to phenol hunt so the investment is also something to consider
[02:03:00.160 --> 02:03:06.960]  when you're talking about the price of a clone right there's a huge amount of time and investment
[02:03:06.960 --> 02:03:13.760]  of energy and staff resources you're talking about a building licensing electricity there's a
[02:03:13.760 --> 02:03:20.000]  huge amount of money and at the end of that really yeah we can make we can make fresh frozen out of
[02:03:20.000 --> 02:03:27.280]  that right um and we do and there's definitely a return on that but it's not the return that we
[02:03:27.280 --> 02:03:34.080]  would get on our flower our flower sales price is significantly higher in terms of side by side
[02:03:34.080 --> 02:03:39.920]  due to the rosin because our flyer our fire flower is so fire that it demands a high price
[02:03:39.920 --> 02:03:45.840]  when it does so right the rosin when you take super that quality of flower and put into a rosin
[02:03:45.840 --> 02:03:51.200]  yeah the rosin is going to be insanely fire but there's also a rosin that is insanely fire that
[02:03:51.200 --> 02:03:58.240]  didn't come from flower that was that good so for we lose money when we take chimera three for
[02:03:58.240 --> 02:04:05.600]  example that's grown in flower form and we make extracts out of that so um that's the other thing
[02:04:05.600 --> 02:04:09.760]  to consider when you're talking about a large scale phenol hunt and that's just 35 lights you
[02:04:09.760 --> 02:04:14.080]  know we're going to do much larger phenol hunts than that than that in the future and you know
[02:04:14.080 --> 02:04:19.760]  you got to look at it if you got a light that's a commercially available light in a commercial
[02:04:19.760 --> 02:04:24.000]  facility if you're growing flower and i know i have plants that grow three pounds plus a light
[02:04:24.560 --> 02:04:29.760]  uh and let's just say for round numbers it's three thousand a pound uh which is not that'll
[02:04:29.760 --> 02:04:34.080]  be nine thousand dollars so i need to get nine thousand dollars out of that light and if i'm
[02:04:34.080 --> 02:04:39.680]  doing a phenol hunt where's that money going to come from you know i mean that that's why it all
[02:04:39.680 --> 02:04:47.200]  makes sense because there's a cost there's a return on investment buyers continue to come back and
[02:04:47.200 --> 02:04:54.320]  rebuy and see the benefits of it um if somebody wanted to take a 10,000 arca and breed with it
[02:04:54.320 --> 02:04:58.880]  like chimera automatically your your breeding project is going to do better than if you took
[02:04:58.880 --> 02:05:03.200]  some no-name strains that you were working on yourself not to be rude about no-name strain but
[02:05:03.200 --> 02:05:08.960]  just saying a strain like chimera or white truffle you're going to sell more seeds so there's the
[02:05:08.960 --> 02:05:14.480]  return on investment there's a demand so full circle it all makes sense the 10,000 arca is
[02:05:14.480 --> 02:05:19.440]  not for everybody and that's totally cool that's why we have different price layers on our menu
[02:05:19.440 --> 02:05:25.920]  and that's why we also have seeds that are as low as 100 for a 15 pack um which is very reasonable
[02:05:26.960 --> 02:05:30.880]  so we we understand there's different different buyers and different price points
[02:05:31.520 --> 02:05:33.120]  that's why we offer lots of different products
[02:05:35.760 --> 02:05:41.200]  nice yeah man you people don't realize you're paying labor too you're paying to
[02:05:41.200 --> 02:05:45.840]  pull the place you're playing paying for the lighting paying for the labor playing in its days
[02:05:45.840 --> 02:05:52.800]  and you know it takes months so it all adds up and you get yours on the back like you did all that
[02:05:52.800 --> 02:05:57.200]  work and you still you know you got to get it on the clone end or the seeding so it makes it makes
[02:05:57.200 --> 02:06:02.000]  a lot of sense definitely um people just don't like you said overstand the whole process they
[02:06:02.000 --> 02:06:08.400]  kind of just see them they take that and think you know take issue with it they just need they just
[02:06:08.400 --> 02:06:13.120]  need to see the whole the whole point of view um and i guarantee if they were in a position to sell
[02:06:13.120 --> 02:06:19.360]  those they might do the same as well and you know a lot of common reaction is you know like well not
[02:06:19.360 --> 02:06:24.400]  everybody can afford that or you know you're gouging people that's that's completely dissolved
[02:06:24.400 --> 02:06:31.680]  as a point because i have a 20 menu you know what i mean that's no longer a point if i was only
[02:06:31.680 --> 02:06:37.280]  selling those and out of phenol like that wouldn't happen because you're gonna find stuff that's
[02:06:37.280 --> 02:06:42.320]  super fire some semi-fire some of the booth so it just wouldn't happen that it would all be super
[02:06:42.320 --> 02:06:48.000]  fire that right there fire this is off the you know the 20 menu that i had you know when i first
[02:06:48.000 --> 02:06:55.840]  hooked up with you i mean fire you know yeah yeah i mean it's serious i can't imagine starting
[02:06:55.840 --> 02:07:01.920]  just starting to grow cannabis and have access to that you know yeah there's always bullshit t-shirts
[02:07:01.920 --> 02:07:08.320]  orangorilla has this now he's i blessed him with the chimera one yeah begrudgingly he's my best
[02:07:08.320 --> 02:07:16.160]  friend for 30 years it's all good but guess what he messed up and lost her so now i i have he's
[02:07:16.160 --> 02:07:22.560]  got to hit me again so now i'm like come on man i'm gonna make you watch that right it's stuff
[02:07:22.560 --> 02:07:28.000]  that's easily given is not really respected sometimes as well you know thank you 100 man
[02:07:28.640 --> 02:07:33.520]  yeah so so guys don't i'm serious like don't think you always have to spend those you know
[02:07:33.520 --> 02:07:40.800]  high dollar um literally you know i got this right off the uh the low cost menu and um love it man
[02:07:40.800 --> 02:07:46.240]  love her we'll never let her go even though she may not be commercial and like you said not going
[02:07:46.240 --> 02:07:52.560]  to give you that huge um yield you can work with her and um she's a big plant she does really well
[02:07:52.560 --> 02:07:59.680]  man very very nice plant and she washes at four and a half percent and she's terpia so yeah oh so
[02:07:59.680 --> 02:08:07.920]  terpy yes yes love it love it i love to see you guys doing well with those genetics man it makes
[02:08:07.920 --> 02:08:13.680]  me really happy because the first time we met and on and then we did the first video and and you know
[02:08:13.680 --> 02:08:20.480]  seeing you now come yeah growing on into your stuff man nice i love it i love it yeah man if
[02:08:20.480 --> 02:08:24.400]  you guys have any you know anything else you want to grow you see on my menu just ask right
[02:08:25.440 --> 02:08:30.880]  yes sir respect lots of fire yes i have no doubt
[02:08:34.640 --> 02:08:38.800]  all right we got any questions chad or you got anything brian what y'all thinking how we feeling
[02:08:40.560 --> 02:08:44.480]  yeah it was uh i guess the the last little part of that question was more like
[02:08:44.480 --> 02:08:49.840]  he i guess he kind of discussed it was you're bringing it it seems like more of a metaphysical
[02:08:49.840 --> 02:08:55.680]  aspect not only from obviously your lifestyle and the kind of theory maybe your belief systems and
[02:08:55.680 --> 02:09:01.680]  all that uh but there's just something to that and um people wanted to maybe kind of know like
[02:09:02.640 --> 02:09:07.200]  is there other ways maybe some books or something that made you see like hey man don't sweat the
[02:09:07.200 --> 02:09:12.160]  bullshit like you mentioned some of the things that happen hey that just kind of happens as
[02:09:12.160 --> 02:09:14.960]  more people find out about you not everybody likes you
[02:09:15.680 --> 02:09:20.720]  not necessarily i mean i would encourage people to you know more look inside themselves you know
[02:09:20.720 --> 02:09:25.920]  i mean books are great for reference points but we have all the answers i believe that we have
[02:09:25.920 --> 02:09:30.960]  all the answers inside ourselves and a little cool meditation a little alone time a little
[02:09:30.960 --> 02:09:37.040]  thinking time and you can solve that man just gotta be realistic and look you can't go running around
[02:09:37.760 --> 02:09:42.560]  you know controlling people so it's pretty obvious you give it up get up you gotta be able to let
[02:09:42.880 --> 02:09:47.680]  get up you gotta be able to let things go in life man um yeah i've read a lot of stuff uh
[02:09:48.320 --> 02:09:56.240]  obviously the rasta farai movement is something that i i appreciate and respect um it's interesting
[02:09:56.240 --> 02:10:06.400]  because for years before i went to jamaica and met my rasta family um sure i was listening to
[02:10:06.400 --> 02:10:11.840]  reggae but i wasn't really listening to it the same way like listening to the the positive lyrics and
[02:10:11.840 --> 02:10:17.920]  saying you know these are something that i would like to become this is something like i study but
[02:10:17.920 --> 02:10:24.000]  it's it's almost you know it's a lifestyle it's a religion almost in that there's standards and
[02:10:24.000 --> 02:10:32.800]  ethics and morals and beliefs that the rasta movement has collectively and just growing up
[02:10:32.800 --> 02:10:38.560]  on my own and kind of searching within myself and finding the truth through meditation and thought
[02:10:39.360 --> 02:10:45.280]  um i had come to certain conclusions about life you know one of those being you know
[02:10:45.920 --> 02:10:50.480]  uh not not to be too involved with gossip or what people think about you like people are allowed to
[02:10:50.480 --> 02:10:55.680]  think whatever they want to think about you that's totally fine like that's your right you have the
[02:10:55.680 --> 02:11:01.280]  right to think and say what you want so if you want to say something bad that's totally cool it's your
[02:11:01.280 --> 02:11:09.680]  choice you know um these tenets of not trying to control other people and knowing you don't have
[02:11:09.680 --> 02:11:15.120]  control of that it brings peace because it's difficult to try to run around and control people
[02:11:15.120 --> 02:11:22.960]  and allow other people's thoughts or words or actions to control you right weakness would lend
[02:11:22.960 --> 02:11:28.160]  somebody to be controlled by another person's thoughts or behaviors or words right that to me
[02:11:28.160 --> 02:11:35.120]  that would be weak if somebody says you know uh whatever they want to say about you if you fall
[02:11:35.120 --> 02:11:40.400]  victims that bro that's weakness i think it's easy to fall victim and to say back to that person well
[02:11:40.400 --> 02:11:46.880]  your mom you know is fat you know like but where does that get anybody that doesn't move us forward
[02:11:46.880 --> 02:11:51.920]  and it doesn't help and that vibe i don't want to be involved with um so i'm just going to skip all
[02:11:51.920 --> 02:11:57.760]  that and i'm just going to move forward and focus on what i focus on and when you do that the universe
[02:11:57.760 --> 02:12:03.200]  opens up to you man things become easier things work and they're in the flow it's when you're
[02:12:03.200 --> 02:12:08.080]  fighting everything the problems are attracted to you and arise that's when you're attracting
[02:12:08.080 --> 02:12:13.360]  and rasta we say that's when you attract the devil you know you're praying to the devil when
[02:12:13.360 --> 02:12:22.320]  you're complaining right so we practice gratitude and we're grateful we rise and give thanks for
[02:12:22.320 --> 02:12:30.880]  life every day you start off from a point of gratitude right so these these things that i've
[02:12:30.880 --> 02:12:36.080]  kind of found myself to be things that i wanted to live by universal truths or or things like you
[02:12:36.080 --> 02:12:41.040]  know be kind to people you know treat people like you want to be treated or better and it doesn't
[02:12:41.040 --> 02:12:45.280]  matter if somebody is rude you treat them well because how you're treating them is a reflection
[02:12:45.280 --> 02:12:50.480]  upon yourself not upon the way they treated you and anybody can respond poorly to somebody who
[02:12:50.480 --> 02:12:56.800]  has insulted them but it takes true strength and power to to stand firm and not let that affect you
[02:12:56.800 --> 02:13:02.960]  and let them go ahead and do or say what they want but not to participate in their negative
[02:13:02.960 --> 02:13:08.960]  and down vibration i might stay in positive vibration we stay up here we stay clean and
[02:13:08.960 --> 02:13:13.840]  correct right so if somebody comes with the negative vibes they can have them themselves
[02:13:13.840 --> 02:13:17.840]  i'm sorry that they do and if they want to talk about it maybe i can help but i'm not going to
[02:13:17.840 --> 02:13:24.000]  participate and i'm not going to share no thank you i'll be happy to share my positive vibes
[02:13:24.560 --> 02:13:28.880]  not going to share your negative vibes so these things that i that i came to conclusions on
[02:13:30.080 --> 02:13:34.960]  the first time i went well it was the second time i went to jamaica that i went to the rasta village
[02:13:37.200 --> 02:13:41.600]  and they told us you know don't bring any candy don't bring any alcohol don't bring any flesh
[02:13:42.160 --> 02:13:48.960]  you know come with respect don't take pictures unless you ask etc so when i got there and i
[02:13:48.960 --> 02:13:54.400]  stayed with them and we smoked and we we you know we sang niobean get rid of them you know
[02:13:54.400 --> 02:13:59.440]  and pounded upon the drum and danced on the fire and smoked chalice that you know yeah
[02:14:00.560 --> 02:14:06.000]  it has a connection that occurs and i realized and so today that we were independently on the
[02:14:06.000 --> 02:14:11.040]  same path that that rasta village and myself and all the rastas in that village were all in the
[02:14:11.040 --> 02:14:17.680]  same path i did not know that that is exactly how rastas lived until i went there when i went there
[02:14:17.680 --> 02:14:21.680]  i did not become a rasta i realized that i already was
[02:14:24.080 --> 02:14:29.840]  through my own effort you know what i'm saying and i think i i kept saying like for a couple
[02:14:29.840 --> 02:14:34.480]  years after i was like everybody's like you're a rasta you just don't know it yet because i think
[02:14:34.480 --> 02:14:40.560]  that souls want to gravitate to kindness and good and they want to be good but people do bad upon
[02:14:40.560 --> 02:14:45.440]  them and they have to work that out you know what i mean but people generally want to gravitate to
[02:14:45.440 --> 02:14:50.320]  being good i don't meet people out there who want to go do evil things on purpose and talk about it
[02:14:50.320 --> 02:14:57.440]  all the time and do that everybody i've ever met they want to do good sometimes good people do bad
[02:14:57.440 --> 02:15:01.440]  things and it changes that perception but they're not bad people they don't set a goal to be bad
[02:15:02.240 --> 02:15:06.080]  they're struggling through something they're struggling through some kind of trauma
[02:15:06.080 --> 02:15:13.440]  or pressure or history or whatever they got so um i mean i i guess i would tell people to search
[02:15:13.440 --> 02:15:16.960]  within themselves i wouldn't even recommend going and following rastafari if that's not
[02:15:16.960 --> 02:15:25.920]  necessarily something that's naturally attracting you um but you know there's certain things that
[02:15:25.920 --> 02:15:32.080]  rastas do we don't we don't um eat flesh we don't eat animal products we don't eat processed food
[02:15:32.640 --> 02:15:39.360]  you know i don't cut or comb my hair these are things these are things that ross's do because
[02:15:40.640 --> 02:15:44.560]  of the way we believe i don't cut or comb my hair because i love myself as i am
[02:15:45.520 --> 02:15:50.640]  cutting and combing and grooming my hair for me maybe not for everybody else out there and that's
[02:15:50.640 --> 02:15:57.040]  totally fine but for me that's a sign of not loving myself as i am for grooming myself and
[02:15:57.040 --> 02:16:04.000]  changing my physical features to a certain standard that i want to think about or uphold or be
[02:16:04.800 --> 02:16:12.240]  is not reasonable to me i love my hair i love the way it knots up when it doesn't get combed
[02:16:13.520 --> 02:16:20.400]  i love it the way i love it gray and black and salt i love myself so i love my hair i don't want
[02:16:20.400 --> 02:16:25.120]  to change it i like it the way it came and i don't really know if i'm smart enough to be able to
[02:16:25.120 --> 02:16:31.120]  change it or not i like it the way it is the body is an amazing system i'm not smart i don't
[02:16:31.120 --> 02:16:36.960]  overstand everything about the body so therefore i don't have the the foundation to go change it
[02:16:38.240 --> 02:16:44.480]  do i cut my toenails yeah okay they get in the way you know i mean do i brush my teeth yeah
[02:16:44.480 --> 02:16:49.200]  because my breath gets stinky and the teeth look gross i think that's a you know you got to find
[02:16:49.200 --> 02:16:56.400]  the balance there um and there are toothbrushes in the rasta village so you know it is it is a
[02:16:56.400 --> 02:17:01.840]  thing um so i would say just you know search within yourself and spend more time with these
[02:17:01.840 --> 02:17:08.800]  plants alone the chit chatters just got to go away yeah damn man i think what you said here
[02:17:08.800 --> 02:17:14.160]  at the end right this is last few minutes is the best thing of the whole episode like that's dope
[02:17:14.640 --> 02:17:19.360]  thank you for for breaking that down for people like to understand kind of the whole the way
[02:17:19.360 --> 02:17:25.520]  rasta's thinking and the concepts and stuff yeah i'm a big big respect yeah i respect every time
[02:17:26.480 --> 02:17:33.280]  no i've i've kind of heard that sentiment before of like i didn't uh you know all of a sudden
[02:17:33.280 --> 02:17:39.040]  become a rasta i've always been rasta and that was from og eddie lep oh yeah had a conversation
[02:17:39.600 --> 02:17:44.480]  with him and that and that was something that came up and then that kind of brings me to you
[02:17:44.480 --> 02:17:51.760]  know the the church that he kind of founded founded um what type of has that thought ever
[02:17:51.760 --> 02:17:57.680]  crossed your mind is there more that you'd be able to do maybe for pheno hunting or for patients or
[02:17:57.680 --> 02:18:07.520]  for gifting uh if you went maybe that route of uh being organized that way i think that that could
[02:18:07.520 --> 02:18:12.240]  that would be a helpful thing i think that many people like i would love to help more people
[02:18:12.240 --> 02:18:20.560]  i i love helping people um i would i would absolutely uh later in life maybe when i have
[02:18:21.200 --> 02:18:25.440]  less work going on and a little more time for that kind of thing i think that'd be great
[02:18:25.440 --> 02:18:31.200]  yeah my grandfather was a minister of the church of christ so and i grew up watching him at you know
[02:18:31.920 --> 02:18:40.080]  at the pulpit you know speaking so uh not that i ever was involved not any more than that in western
[02:18:40.080 --> 02:18:45.840]  you know religion um i think it's been bastardized way too much and so forth but that's another
[02:18:45.840 --> 02:18:53.520]  topic uh uh so yeah i it's there it's definitely there and you know whenever i can help i'd like
[02:18:54.320 --> 02:18:59.680]  cool yeah no that's that's just interesting and kind of like marco and brian are saying i love
[02:18:59.680 --> 02:19:04.800]  where you're coming from with that and uh you know it's kind of demonstrated i mean you blessed
[02:19:04.800 --> 02:19:09.760]  us uh with you know some seeds and shirts and these little things that now are bringing us so
[02:19:09.760 --> 02:19:15.040]  much joy and yeah you know it's those little things that pass forward so appreciate that
[02:19:16.400 --> 02:19:20.720]  question wise from chat we don't really seem to have a whole bunch of questions right now
[02:19:20.720 --> 02:19:24.640]  they kind of been going back and forth amongst themselves you've definitely answered some
[02:19:24.640 --> 02:19:30.080]  questions you know there was some inquiry about creature um you kind of touched on the creature
[02:19:30.080 --> 02:19:37.520]  and what she does and what she kind of adds to it um i i went to your new uh instagram and you know
[02:19:37.520 --> 02:19:43.680]  everybody watching uh the new instagram is in the notes but you have there's many accounts out there
[02:19:43.680 --> 02:19:48.640]  i didn't see creature on this one though but i know the last time you were on we pulled up creatures
[02:19:48.640 --> 02:19:53.440]  yeah yeah i haven't posted the creature i'll post her up she's she's sexy she deserves to be back
[02:19:53.440 --> 02:19:58.240]  yeah that's account uh the newest account we have is a main is our 78th account
[02:19:59.440 --> 02:20:02.240]  on instagram so we just keep refreshing you know
[02:20:04.560 --> 02:20:11.280]  yeah uh bee leaf number 298 yeah you said it though we can't hit 500 you know
[02:20:14.080 --> 02:20:19.360]  that's the great thing about a website though your website stays the same the website stays
[02:20:19.360 --> 02:20:23.760]  the same i actually have a pack of seeds i wanted to give away i wanted you guys to kind of decide
[02:20:23.760 --> 02:20:29.200]  uh however we're going to do that uh this is the jelly truffle so that's a collab between in-house
[02:20:29.200 --> 02:20:37.280]  and myself jelly breath bx1 number six times y truffle boom so how should we give them away chat
[02:20:38.320 --> 02:20:46.320]  what do y'all think let's let the chat say how we give them away yeah i've i've found that i've found
[02:20:46.320 --> 02:20:53.840]  that numbers is the smoothest because we have the answer clearly defined before we start and there's
[02:20:53.840 --> 02:20:59.760]  no interpretation other than if some which will always happen two people enter the same answer
[02:20:59.760 --> 02:21:06.720]  at the same time and one shows above but that's really the worst that can happen uh yeah experience
[02:21:06.720 --> 02:21:14.960]  wise picking a number is the best even though it isn't the sexiest yeah i agree yeah i get the same
[02:21:14.960 --> 02:21:20.240]  thing on my lives you know it's like i make it very clear it's the first one i see on my chat
[02:21:20.240 --> 02:21:25.040]  yours may be different it doesn't matter mine is the one that matters yeah well tell them about
[02:21:25.040 --> 02:21:30.480]  what's in the box what we got in those genetic what's in the box this is higher bro so i mean
[02:21:30.480 --> 02:21:35.680]  like our little boxes they're a little unique you know you get this little truffle jelly or what is
[02:21:35.680 --> 02:21:40.560]  that i can't this is uh yeah yep and then you get your little pack of seeds but the genetics are
[02:21:40.880 --> 02:21:53.520]  so the the jelly breath is bred by in-house right um and we tested that uh the bx1 the jelly
[02:21:53.520 --> 02:21:59.920]  breath bx1 for in-house and during that testing i identified the number six pheno to be our winner
[02:21:59.920 --> 02:22:10.000]  that we kept she's extremely trichome rich real fat round golf balls um she smells like pine gas
[02:22:10.000 --> 02:22:20.000]  and fresh like uh wet stones in a creek right there's that like almost clean kind of thing it's
[02:22:20.000 --> 02:22:25.760]  it's like yeah it's just wet and clean like in a little mineral con it's really cool it's really
[02:22:25.760 --> 02:22:32.720]  cool um but she's got that gas and she's got she's got that pine so she's just super sexy
[02:22:33.680 --> 02:22:38.800]  we've used her in every breeding project that we've done so far so the jelly breath is definitely
[02:22:38.800 --> 02:22:44.400]  one of my all-star gals um she was on the 5 000 dollar menu i think she's in the 3 500 dollar menu
[02:22:44.400 --> 02:22:52.560]  now um as far as a clone um and then of course we hit her with the white truffle pollen and their
[02:22:52.560 --> 02:22:58.320]  babies their offspring are super sexy the in the testing the phenos a lot of the white truffle
[02:22:58.320 --> 02:23:04.480]  phenos lean towards white truffle in the nose and in the blood structure and in the purple
[02:23:04.880 --> 02:23:11.600]  tones in flower their uh the white truffle is very dominant in these crosses and um i would say about
[02:23:13.040 --> 02:23:20.560]  i'd say most of the phenos are influenced about 75 to 65 by white truffle they're most i mean
[02:23:20.560 --> 02:23:24.000]  they're definitely white truffle with a tickle of this and a tickle of that in most cases
[02:23:24.720 --> 02:23:28.640]  and now do you see some of the phenos that don't that aren't purple at all
[02:23:28.640 --> 02:23:32.480]  they stay green or pretty much she takes the purple anytime you cross
[02:23:33.120 --> 02:23:38.960]  there's very very few very very few that didn't go purple in here let me think um
[02:23:40.800 --> 02:23:45.920]  bro i don't even know okay so the monster truffle there was a few phenos of that that stayed green
[02:23:45.920 --> 02:23:52.560]  but those weren't released due to intersex issues um i don't think anything that was released
[02:23:53.600 --> 02:23:58.000]  didn't go purple like every pheno every plant in there you know i take my rooms cold at the end so
[02:23:58.720 --> 02:24:04.880]  i'm inducing that for sure um but it's in the genetic so it's not that cold it's 65 degrees
[02:24:05.520 --> 02:24:11.760]  exactly cool and i just want to clarify real quick too um usually when i do it i only do
[02:24:11.760 --> 02:24:19.760]  us only um even canada is is rough canada and like belize same difference um is that is that
[02:24:19.760 --> 02:24:25.600]  kind of domestic only for this as well i don't have any problem bro we'll get it there cool
[02:24:26.480 --> 02:24:31.040]  as long as people find australia is like the only place right now because uh us took it off
[02:24:31.040 --> 02:24:35.680]  with shipping we can't ship to australia right now if anybody on australia i'm sorry about that
[02:24:35.680 --> 02:24:39.360]  maybe fly to some other place and pick up your seeds other than that i'll send them wherever
[02:24:39.360 --> 02:24:44.400]  brother cool i got a map behind me we send seeds all over the world that's awesome that's a
[02:24:44.400 --> 02:24:49.120]  beautiful thing that is awesome because i'm i've tried to ship a few things internationally it's
[02:24:49.120 --> 02:24:54.800]  fucking hard man so it's difficult trying to yeah i mean we got clones through uh alive to
[02:24:54.800 --> 02:25:01.520]  england and dude has the moms he's happy as can be 11 days in a box live clones wow you'd be over
[02:25:01.520 --> 02:25:07.440]  there with the willy wonka ticket buddy yes you were people be wondering how the fuck you did
[02:25:07.440 --> 02:25:12.080]  that shit right where'd you get this i don't even know that happened honestly i got a connection at
[02:25:12.160 --> 02:25:12.880]  the airport
[02:25:15.680 --> 02:25:23.360]  the panza oh shit all right well um it's open if you want to be leaf if you want to hop in the
[02:25:23.360 --> 02:25:29.440]  private chat here and type in a number you can do that okay uh we'll do that and then everybody in
[02:25:29.440 --> 02:25:35.680]  chat i will give you a heads up before we actually start and i'm not picking the number so no it's
[02:25:35.680 --> 02:25:40.800]  not going to be my favorite number let's do i'm gonna do a random just watching in there okay
[02:25:40.800 --> 02:25:47.680]  yeah i think that's more yeah pull your phone out there you go yeah man yeah yeah super scientific
[02:25:47.680 --> 02:25:52.400]  love yeah let's do um so what do you do you have people pick numbers in the comments over there
[02:25:52.400 --> 02:25:58.800]  yeah yeah let's go like one to a thousand sounds good okay so pick your number between one to a
[02:25:58.800 --> 02:26:04.640]  thousand and now who is it whoever picks that number first i reckon or whoever you see first
[02:26:04.640 --> 02:26:11.760]  and i'm gonna type in start so start one to a thousand there we go and then like 60 seconds
[02:26:11.760 --> 02:26:17.360]  or two minutes or whatever i'll just turn my camera around here my phone around and i'll push
[02:26:17.360 --> 02:26:23.040]  that generate button oh but then we then we have to go through all of the guesses see that's why
[02:26:23.040 --> 02:26:27.360]  it's good if we have the number beforehand because i can see as the guesses go by yeah we can do that
[02:26:27.360 --> 02:26:32.160]  i can generate it just type it in the private comments so do another start chat okay i'm gonna
[02:26:32.160 --> 02:26:40.720]  do a stop stop oh stop sorry just try to make it easy here jasper here he's done that because yeah
[02:26:41.840 --> 02:26:46.320]  sometimes you can see it go by and you're like all right write the name down don't have to look
[02:26:48.720 --> 02:26:54.160]  everybody stop stop stop no guesses yeah we did stop and i know we're usually on a little uh
[02:26:55.440 --> 02:26:59.920]  yeah i was gonna say there's a definitely a delay usually like a 20 second delay here but
[02:26:59.920 --> 02:27:04.880]  they've they've got the uh stop all stop sign thumbs up button right quick while we're waiting
[02:27:04.880 --> 02:27:11.920]  to get set up y'all give us a thumbs up we are guessing sign in too i guess they're uh they're
[02:27:11.920 --> 02:27:17.360]  making our stuff more and more that you have to sign in to see it oh yeah like and subscribe for
[02:27:17.360 --> 02:27:24.880]  sure oh yeah i'm just gonna put this in cap locks because cap locks is annoying but one guess only
[02:27:25.520 --> 02:27:31.280]  unless somebody guesses your number above you then you can re-guess uh so we're guessing one
[02:27:31.280 --> 02:27:39.040]  to a thousand one guess only anywhere but the land down under and we all know the number so
[02:27:39.920 --> 02:27:43.440]  yeah i don't know i didn't look at i'll go look let me go look well at least we're
[02:27:44.640 --> 02:27:46.000]  all's fair here here we go
[02:27:46.560 --> 02:27:56.080]  back all right so i am going to type in start and here we go all right excellent i'll be watching
[02:27:56.640 --> 02:28:04.480]  i'll be watching just go till they hit it chat yeah i kind of hope this goes to somebody that's
[02:28:04.480 --> 02:28:09.520]  new to this it's like wanting to get into like spring and summer farming and just rocks it with
[02:28:09.520 --> 02:28:18.080]  some free gear yes yeah no bullshit t-shirts with uh with cds from overseas with genetics
[02:28:18.080 --> 02:28:21.200]  i always joke that the t-shirt was worth more than the genetics
[02:28:22.560 --> 02:28:29.520]  this shit was rough man oh yeah old cd case or t-shirt oh yeah yeah the cd case we had that
[02:28:29.520 --> 02:28:33.280]  request we just sent some to germany it was like can you put it still a thing huh
[02:28:33.600 --> 02:28:37.520]  it's old tech those people are
[02:28:43.120 --> 02:28:49.120]  yeah really it's my new mixtape get your guesses in i haven't seen it yet
[02:28:53.840 --> 02:29:00.320]  i've seen one that's very very very close but nothing exact so yeah what i'll do too is i'll
[02:29:00.320 --> 02:29:08.480]  set a kind of a two minute timer here so if nobody guesses it exactly okay what do we do then
[02:29:09.600 --> 02:29:14.560]  well then we'll go with the closest yeah without going over like the price is right all right
[02:29:16.560 --> 02:29:27.360]  well we'll just get the the closest to it oh uh do i see i do see it i do see it where uh

[02:30:09.520 --> 02:30:15.760]  in-house and belief collaboration what's the best way for him to contact you uh to
[02:30:15.760 --> 02:30:19.920]  give you his details and all that so he should do two things to make sure it comes through
[02:30:19.920 --> 02:30:27.440]  number one is he should email us at belief cannabis at gmail.com belief cannabis at gmail.com
[02:30:28.080 --> 02:30:34.720]  and then the other thing you should do is dm us on instagram at belief takeover underscore so
[02:30:34.720 --> 02:30:42.640]  belief cannabis at gmail.com and then we've got you at belief takeover underscore don't forget
[02:30:42.640 --> 02:30:48.960]  the underscore yes contact us please both uh through both of those so we make sure we don't
[02:30:48.960 --> 02:30:55.120]  miss it or lose it or it does you know spam folder or whatever and those are 15 that's a 15 pack
[02:30:55.920 --> 02:31:03.680]  uh this is a 10 pack and this is one of them that's on my uh 350r uh cd now did they get an
[02:31:03.680 --> 02:31:10.720]  entry on the friday night live not absolutely on the spot boom absolutely yeah one guy got that
[02:31:10.720 --> 02:31:14.480]  and then he actually won on the friday live like man i feel guilty bro you're like giving me
[02:31:15.040 --> 02:31:19.040]  good stuff bro and i know keep it or give it to somebody who needs it i don't want it it's all
[02:31:19.040 --> 02:31:26.880]  yours right yeah well you guys heard it from chad's uh own mouth that he had two seeds right
[02:31:26.880 --> 02:31:34.000]  you got both of them so i'm decently good at math man and from a genetic standpoint
[02:31:34.000 --> 02:31:39.600]  that seems pretty badass for you to because i know uh knowing you decently well chad i
[02:31:39.600 --> 02:31:46.160]  i would imagine it takes a lot for you to be like these two are keepers it it is because i'm only
[02:31:46.160 --> 02:31:53.280]  messing around with like the 10.5s like the 10s aren't cutting it anymore it's got to be a 10.5
[02:31:53.280 --> 02:32:00.320]  and i literally have never grown anything with so much trichome coverage yes like you got a new
[02:32:00.320 --> 02:32:08.640]  rating scale now i do it's there's the there's a new bar there's a new bar so i feel the same
[02:32:08.640 --> 02:32:15.360]  way after growing this man's stuff yeah and the terpenes too like even if it didn't have the amount
[02:32:15.360 --> 02:32:21.600]  of trichomes the terpenes are enough for me to keep it so yeah it's exactly what i was looking
[02:32:21.600 --> 02:32:25.840]  for exactly what i was hoping for you know i went with a few things in this last run that were on
[02:32:25.840 --> 02:32:29.920]  the kind of the gassy or the chem side i was looking for something funk but i'm like you know
[02:32:29.920 --> 02:32:35.440]  i need something pleasing for the palate as well hoping you know hoping it had a good cross and
[02:32:35.520 --> 02:32:43.840]  dude yeah paid itself forward huge so i think i love it thank you well that was fun i love giving
[02:32:43.840 --> 02:32:49.760]  it to you the way yeah i absolutely love it so much fun always good and and i'm stoked to see
[02:32:49.760 --> 02:32:57.200]  too you know uh brian is someone who we see uh in many shows uh for a while uh so you know kind
[02:32:57.200 --> 02:33:03.440]  of a fcp regular which is always nice uh and there he goes yep thanks all right so appreciate that
[02:33:04.320 --> 02:33:10.800]  yep yeah big up brian rosspect good job contact me with any questions about those two and please
[02:33:10.800 --> 02:33:17.600]  keep me in the loop when you get pictures that'd be great yeah and then just potential ferraris
[02:33:19.040 --> 02:33:25.920]  hey hey billy frank before we go though um since he did win seeds give the folks a little bit of
[02:33:25.920 --> 02:33:30.640]  few quick tips on what to be looking for and what you would like to see from him as he's
[02:33:30.640 --> 02:33:34.720]  growing these things out if he's kind of giving you a little feedback i mean so if he's giving me
[02:33:34.720 --> 02:33:40.240]  feedback that's where we get our testers from you know what i mean and um the people who give me
[02:33:40.240 --> 02:33:46.160]  that every seven days give me just a brief note you know a couple sentences it's fine anything
[02:33:46.160 --> 02:33:50.880]  that stands out in your mind it doesn't have to be a long dissertation and maybe a few photos like
[02:33:50.880 --> 02:33:56.240]  a top view and a side view that's i'm good that's all i really like you know and then if you do that
[02:33:56.800 --> 02:34:01.280]  the thing with my testers is now we we sent out i sent out 50 packs and i only got a response from
[02:34:01.280 --> 02:34:08.240]  70 right so i said okay that's not gonna work you know it's got to be some kind of give and take here
[02:34:08.240 --> 02:34:14.400]  so well go ahead just to cut you so i you sent me a pack to test and i have them and i have
[02:34:14.400 --> 02:34:18.960]  the documentation but i wasn't sure on how you wanted to see that so you want that in the email
[02:34:18.960 --> 02:34:25.440]  kind of in a little bit of a write-up yeah yeah yeah send me an email um every seven days is great
[02:34:25.920 --> 02:34:30.640]  and then just send me some pictures and that's good um what i'm doing with my testers now is
[02:34:30.640 --> 02:34:35.680]  like if somebody contacts you says they want to test me if they look like they grow well okay
[02:34:35.680 --> 02:34:39.200]  because i want my stuff represented well so you got to be able to grow well if you're testing if
[02:34:39.200 --> 02:34:44.160]  you're not growing well you should probably learn how to grow well before you test um so if they
[02:34:44.160 --> 02:34:52.640]  grow well i'll say look it's 200 a pack of 10 if you send me updates every seven days and pictures
[02:34:52.640 --> 02:34:55.280]  i will refund you that 200 at the end of the group
[02:34:58.860 --> 02:35:05.340]  fair as hell fair yeah and beat that brother and they're gonna get winners so i mean basically
[02:35:05.340 --> 02:35:12.540]  they're getting seeds for free period all they gotta do is send me an email every seven days
[02:35:12.540 --> 02:35:18.380]  it's really not that tough exactly yeah nope and i've like this last one i've been keeping a grow
[02:35:18.380 --> 02:35:23.820]  diary so i'll put together the uh the compilation for you the compilation grow so you can binge
[02:35:23.820 --> 02:35:29.100]  watch it you know it's not not every week you gotta tune back in yeah yeah yeah we'll get you
[02:35:29.100 --> 02:35:33.500]  the binge watch version the binge watch version works really good too i love that's actually more
[02:35:33.500 --> 02:35:40.540]  efficient so maybe that's the new standard all right setting a new bar chair if there's a problem
[02:35:40.540 --> 02:35:44.620]  if there's a problem we know that right away because you know we order boxes and do all that
[02:35:44.620 --> 02:35:50.700]  stuff based on based on having no problem all right cool cool well yeah i think everything in
[02:35:50.700 --> 02:35:57.340]  chat is is just kind of winding down and wrapping up always uh always good times with contests here
[02:35:57.340 --> 02:36:02.620]  but you know i usually like to give everybody uh some you know last words opportunities to sneak
[02:36:02.620 --> 02:36:07.980]  in there um brian and marco let's do that and then maybe we'll touch on some house cleaning
[02:36:07.980 --> 02:36:16.540]  and then head it over to belief to take us out oh yeah i just uh wanted to thank marco again for uh
[02:36:16.540 --> 02:36:20.700]  you know inviting me over this weekend i you know it was kind of cool to see people excited
[02:36:20.700 --> 02:36:26.140]  about cannabis again uh here in denver and i'm sure around other parts of the country it's just
[02:36:26.140 --> 02:36:33.980]  kind of a yeah you know the it's like it's kind of lost its luster uh at that level where uh at
[02:36:33.980 --> 02:36:41.100]  least in dc there had to be like 10 15 000 people there marco yeah i say yeah you don't really see
[02:36:41.100 --> 02:36:47.420]  that anymore oh wow yeah and they and they were pretty hyped for like a group i mean again we're
[02:36:47.420 --> 02:36:52.780]  they're all stoners so it's not like it's well you know we've been locked down for a couple years too
[02:36:52.780 --> 02:37:00.220]  you know everybody's been you know i haven't but the world's been locked down so people are kind
[02:37:00.220 --> 02:37:08.540]  of feeling they're feeling it getting out and shit so yeah oh and then uh this weekend i will uh

[02:38:07.980 --> 02:38:13.740]  wow that's a huge water only so didn't uh yeah there's you know there's a lot of people out there
[02:38:13.740 --> 02:38:21.340]  that have magic sauce that can probably expand on even this and it's under a 480 watt light so
[02:38:21.340 --> 02:38:26.460]  you know if you got a thousand watts you might bring something else out of it too so that's how
[02:38:26.460 --> 02:38:33.660]  i roll uh housekeeping uh brian tomorrow with layton are you guys back on you got a topic for us
[02:38:34.220 --> 02:38:39.500]  yeah we're uh we're back with terp wizard we're doing a back to back uh he was with us with the
[02:38:39.500 --> 02:38:45.500]  bee um talking b tech uh and then of course you know peter's always got that i call it like his
[02:38:45.500 --> 02:38:51.660]  hail mary but you know and he's like uh so he brought on uh mr ken's uh somerville and uh yeah
[02:38:51.660 --> 02:38:57.180]  we just kind of chopped it up for b tech for three hours instead of just one hour so we're
[02:38:57.180 --> 02:39:01.740]  bringing it back so we can talk solventless tech uh probably also a little bit of genetics but
[02:39:01.740 --> 02:39:06.220]  mostly focused on solventless tech because so many people want to learn and kind of pick his brain i
[02:39:06.220 --> 02:39:11.900]  mean there are a lot of uh cute little names out there and stuff but i i feel like mr wizard over

[02:39:29.820 --> 02:39:35.180]  a brain to uh to pick because there's so many people that i admire that are talking about
