[00:00.000 --> 00:09.880]  What's up everybody this is Windy City Garden. So I'm a new grower. First let's
[00:09.880 --> 00:16.800]  get that out of the way. I am a medical patient based out of Illinois. They
[00:16.800 --> 00:22.880]  recently changed the law to allow medical grow and so I got my
[00:22.880 --> 00:28.600]  my license to do that and so that's what this garden is. This is a caretaker
[00:28.600 --> 00:34.480]  garden that I'm helping another medical patient with. So you can see what we got
[00:34.480 --> 00:39.960]  cooking in here just doing some little maintenance on these guys. So yeah we'll
[00:39.960 --> 00:43.760]  walk you through the property. We used to have five plants actually. We had a
[00:43.760 --> 00:48.760]  problem with root aphids earlier this year. We'd started off in this bed and
[00:48.760 --> 00:52.840]  out of the five plants that we'd put in the bed the root aphids killed
[00:52.840 --> 00:56.200]  everything but two of the plants. We ended up treating with nematodes and
[00:56.200 --> 01:00.960]  Dr. Zimes treatments and we ended up clearing the beds and we still were
[01:00.960 --> 01:05.480]  able to save two of the plants. This is the remnants of one and I'll get into
[01:05.480 --> 01:09.720]  why it's like that in just a second. If you want to lay any bets as to why
[01:09.720 --> 01:16.400]  that's what we've got left of a plant submit your submit your answers now. And
[01:16.400 --> 01:20.800]  then this was the other plant that we had in here. This is an Acapulco gold and
[01:20.800 --> 01:24.760]  we had pulled it out of the bed put it into new soil treated all the soil with
[01:24.760 --> 01:33.120]  nematodes and Dr. Zimes and we got rid of we got past the aphids problem. Up
[01:33.120 --> 01:38.280]  until this week we actually had a full the biggest bush that we had was this
[01:38.280 --> 01:43.360]  one right here and it came out I mean we had stake marks all the way out to here
[01:43.360 --> 01:47.360]  which is about four feet off the bed maybe three feet off the bed and had
[01:47.360 --> 01:51.680]  full trellis systems on it it was massive it was gonna be I mean I don't
[01:51.680 --> 01:55.320]  know a lot this is my first season but it was gonna be in the pounds yieldage
[01:55.320 --> 02:02.200]  for sure. What we're working with now though is four four plants these are
[02:02.200 --> 02:10.120]  critical plants from seed stockers based out of Spain so three of them are the
[02:10.120 --> 02:19.520]  clones of that and then this is an Acapulco gold and yeah this is this is
[02:19.640 --> 02:23.200]  what we've got for our garden. The one that was right here was actually a bag
[02:23.200 --> 02:30.520]  seed and you know so not surprising if that gives anybody else any any more
[02:30.520 --> 02:37.600]  tips well I guess I'll just say it that plant ended up herming and yeah so we
[02:37.600 --> 02:41.800]  had to cut it because it started to seed itself and I've been doing some
[02:41.800 --> 02:46.600]  inspection on these plants to see if they've been seeded at all and some of
[02:46.600 --> 02:49.480]  them look like they might have gotten in touch with pollen somebody said to look
[02:49.480 --> 02:54.000]  for brown brown pistol hairs which would indicate pollination and there
[02:54.000 --> 02:58.400]  are definitely some on some of these plants so we'll see hopefully the damage
[02:58.400 --> 03:04.080]  was somewhat contained but it's hard to say. We're growing in an organic super
[03:04.080 --> 03:10.320]  soil out here with a lot of down-to-earth amendments. I love the
[03:10.320 --> 03:16.760]  shape of these plants it's really nice focus.
[03:16.800 --> 03:24.280]  These are 15 gallon containers with you know blood meal kelp meal, langbenite,
[03:24.280 --> 03:33.680]  seabird guano, alfalfa meal, insect frass, all sorts of amendments dropped into
[03:33.680 --> 03:38.720]  there and yeah they're doing pretty well I would say. We started transitioning to
[03:38.720 --> 03:44.480]  flower on these three plants at the very beginning of August. I was very surprised
[03:44.480 --> 03:50.680]  to see how far along they got the very beginning of August. Oops there we go.
[03:50.680 --> 03:59.040]  And this one this Acapulco gold I think because it's got that deep sativa nature
[03:59.040 --> 04:03.960]  to it it's it's waiting for things to get closer probably to the 11 and 11
[04:03.960 --> 04:10.160]  hour cycle so we'll see how much later it takes until she really starts to to
[04:10.160 --> 04:17.360]  flower up. So yeah that's what we're working with. Four of the five plants
[04:17.360 --> 04:23.840]  that we had started with about halfway through the season we had killed three
[04:23.840 --> 04:31.840]  we had lost three that were also bag seed actually and you know turns out
[04:31.840 --> 04:38.340]  that was probably for the best because that bag seed was a was a herm so had
[04:38.340 --> 04:45.420]  some hermaphroditic tendencies. So yeah in terms of pest
[04:45.420 --> 04:48.260]  management since we got past the rudaphids we've just been deploying
[04:48.260 --> 04:56.260]  beneficial insects. We were using neem up until flower but then I saw the the talk
[04:56.260 --> 05:01.460]  with Scott Scamneys, Scott Scamness I'm sure I'm butchering his name where he
[05:01.460 --> 05:06.740]  talked about how the azaracanin in neem oil was a problem so we cut that out and
[05:06.740 --> 05:09.860]  we went basically right to beneficial insects at that point so we've got lady
[05:09.860 --> 05:16.260]  bugs we've got green lacewings which you can see down here we've got trichogamma
[05:16.260 --> 05:28.180]  trichogramma parasitic wasps and and assassin bugs so we've kind of got a
[05:28.180 --> 05:34.660]  full assortment of beneficial insects that are in here right now and hopefully
[05:34.660 --> 05:39.620]  that protects us from caterpillars and any other would-be pest until we can
[05:39.620 --> 05:46.220]  finish the season. Yeah so this is again this is a caretaker outdoor patch that
[05:46.220 --> 05:50.980]  I'm helping somebody with and in just a second I'll show you my indoor. Let's see
[05:50.980 --> 05:57.700]  genetics critical from seed stockers acapulco gold from Barney's farm
[05:57.700 --> 06:02.020]  critical from seed stockers critical from seed stockers they're just clones
[06:02.020 --> 06:06.100]  of each other so these are all the same plant it wasn't a you know that I picked
[06:06.100 --> 06:10.780]  out a particularly good pheno it was literally my first time growing and you
[06:10.780 --> 06:14.940]  know you google where to get seeds and you order some seeds so it was really
[06:14.940 --> 06:18.620]  like that simple and now that I'm like a little further into it I wish that I
[06:18.620 --> 06:22.540]  had gotten maybe better you know quote unquote American better American
[06:22.540 --> 06:27.780]  genetics or something that's maybe more aligned with where I'm growing maybe
[06:27.780 --> 06:31.300]  like breeders out of Michigan would have been maybe a good place to go or
[06:31.300 --> 06:35.580]  Massachusetts just in terms of finishing dates and all that kind of
[06:35.580 --> 06:41.540]  stuff and also stuff that's well suited for you know in October that can get wet
[06:41.540 --> 06:47.660]  or or cold but didn't know about that at the time didn't do enough research kind
[06:47.660 --> 06:53.140]  of just ordered seeds and and off we went and you know next season I think
[06:53.140 --> 06:59.020]  I'm gonna go in with a better plan but this has been a really fun learning and
[06:59.220 --> 07:07.220]  I guess pun not intended growing experience so yeah in Illinois we're
[07:07.220 --> 07:13.620]  legally allowed to grow five plants with a medical license and so now we're down
[07:13.620 --> 07:17.860]  to the four sadly because we lost this one it was uh yeah it was a hermaphrodite
[07:17.860 --> 07:24.460]  so just beware of bag seed man test it out before you run it full time and
[07:24.460 --> 07:28.820]  hopefully it didn't get too much to the rest of our crop because those seeds
[07:28.820 --> 07:35.940]  are gonna be useless really so yeah here's the outdoor let me know if you
[07:35.940 --> 07:40.860]  have any questions and I'll show you the indoor in just a second so I'll take you
[07:40.860 --> 07:43.780]  into the cave in just a second but I figured that we might start out here so
[07:43.780 --> 07:47.660]  that we can talk about sort of what I'm growing all organically using a lot of
[07:47.660 --> 07:53.140]  down-to-earth amendments and you can see what I got working with here is some
[07:53.140 --> 07:59.900]  neem seed meal gypsum for calcium we've got just an all-purpose 444 which is a
[07:59.900 --> 08:06.060]  blend of all of this stuff some humic acids this is azomite right here which
[08:06.060 --> 08:10.580]  is for micro nutrients from what I understand here's kelp meal and here's
[08:10.580 --> 08:15.900]  langdonite which is a high potassium source here's some alfalfa meal blood
[08:15.900 --> 08:24.820]  meal seabird guano crab meal then some combination of all of these are in my in
[08:24.820 --> 08:30.740]  in what was in the outdoor and what's in the indoor it's been pretty good I was
[08:30.740 --> 08:34.500]  looking for a system where I would basically build the soil and then all I
[08:34.500 --> 08:39.580]  would have to do is add teas and water occasionally and that's pretty well the
[08:39.580 --> 08:43.500]  direction that I've gone in I've really enjoyed it it's been fairly easy I'm
[08:43.540 --> 08:49.380]  growing in three gallon bags for most of my stuff at least on the indoor the
[08:49.380 --> 08:53.020]  outdoor is obviously bigger it's 15 gallons and then we're doing occasional
[08:53.020 --> 09:01.140]  earthworm casting teas along with this is recharge from real growers so
[09:01.140 --> 09:07.860]  infusing our micro microbiology and microbes into the soil to regulate pH so
[09:07.860 --> 09:12.300]  I can just water in regular water in between those and we're also adding in
[09:12.300 --> 09:20.540]  occasionally Epsom salts and silica the actual bags of these live over at the
[09:20.540 --> 09:25.260]  outdoor which is why so the way that the law works is kind of silly you can only
[09:25.260 --> 09:30.500]  have five plants per property it's not even per medical patient so if you have
[09:30.500 --> 09:33.340]  two medical patients that live under the same room you still only have five
[09:33.340 --> 09:36.540]  plants total in the house which is just like doesn't make any sense to me it
[09:36.540 --> 09:40.500]  seems like a poorly written law in Michigan you can have 12 recreationally
[09:40.660 --> 09:46.260]  I just don't understand why you know but in any event the law changed in January
[09:46.260 --> 09:50.700]  officially on the first of the year and in the recreational law they included
[09:50.700 --> 09:53.940]  the provision for home grow for medical patients and that's what inspired me to
[09:53.940 --> 09:58.300]  get to grow my own and that's what led me down the rabbit hole so really I got
[09:58.300 --> 10:06.100]  started after getting my my card I got started in March and basically started
[10:06.100 --> 10:09.020]  acquiring all of this stuff doing research on the internet we popped
[10:09.020 --> 10:12.140]  bag seed and then I ordered the other plants and we'll talk about that in just
[10:12.140 --> 10:17.740]  a second under here I've got my water which is basically just tap water that
[10:17.740 --> 10:21.420]  I'm aerating the chlorine out of using these air pumps and then I've got this
[10:21.420 --> 10:25.140]  bigger air pump for making compost teas well actually earthworm casting teas
[10:25.140 --> 10:31.380]  with recharge to inoculate the soil with along with some macro nutrients and some
[10:31.380 --> 10:37.060]  micro nutrients like I'll throw in some calcium and some and some azomite along
[10:37.100 --> 10:42.580]  with some phosphorus and potassium for and I'll and I'll try to make it you
[10:42.580 --> 10:48.180]  know I don't have I don't have a microscope to really see what I'm
[10:48.180 --> 10:52.580]  getting into it but what I understand and maybe this is like you know bro
[10:52.580 --> 10:57.420]  science maybe it's not is that if you use earthworm castings and you and you
[10:57.420 --> 11:02.580]  go for more than 24 hours in a compost tea you wind up with a more fungally
[11:02.580 --> 11:09.300]  dominated compost tea generally speaking you know fungally dominated
[11:09.300 --> 11:16.500]  compost teas are good for for flowering cycle which is what we're in and all of
[11:16.500 --> 11:21.500]  these plants that are in here here's the 2x4 tent that I've got again started
[11:21.500 --> 11:24.820]  this in March so I've just been trying to acquire equipment over the the course
[11:24.820 --> 11:32.260]  of the pandemic basically these are some auto flowers that I started 86 days ago
[11:33.140 --> 11:37.900]  and you know they've been fine but they're finicky I feel like auto flowers
[11:37.900 --> 11:40.940]  it's like if you don't get everything right and veg and then you flip into
[11:40.940 --> 11:46.140]  flower and everything's not right like you your yields gonna suffer your
[11:46.140 --> 11:50.780]  potency will probably suffer like I just don't know that it's the most in one way
[11:50.780 --> 11:54.180]  it's efficient because you could do a perpetual cycle of auto flowers it would
[11:54.180 --> 11:58.460]  start to cost a lot and seed but from a home growers perspective I think that
[11:58.460 --> 12:01.580]  that's one method that you could do once you get your system dialed in so that
[12:01.580 --> 12:07.740]  you're really good and that you're not wasting any moment of veg or any moment
[12:07.740 --> 12:10.380]  of flower so I think you need to be really dialed in to work with auto
[12:10.380 --> 12:15.460]  flowers successfully I think in the future I'm gonna work with photo periods
[12:15.460 --> 12:17.740]  just because there's a little bit more grace to it there's a little bit more of
[12:17.740 --> 12:21.980]  like if you mess up you know you still have time to like correct mistakes and
[12:21.980 --> 12:27.180]  veg before you flip into flower these are the critical plants this is the same
[12:27.180 --> 12:32.820]  this is the mother of the plants that are out in the outdoor right now pretty
[12:32.820 --> 12:36.740]  nice growth this is the first seed that I popped and I decided that it was time
[12:36.740 --> 12:42.020]  to throw it into flower because next time on the flip of this tent what I
[12:42.020 --> 12:46.740]  really want to do is I really want to do a proper pheno hunt so I've got a pack
[12:46.740 --> 12:52.660]  of 14 seeds that I that I'm gonna be running once everything is clear out of
[12:52.660 --> 12:58.620]  this tent so there's four plants in this tent and yeah this one is gonna be
[12:58.620 --> 13:02.060]  this is the mother plant for those other ones and we're just gonna try and grow
[13:02.060 --> 13:07.140]  as much nice bud on this as we can who's gonna do a little maintenance forgive me
[13:07.140 --> 13:12.100]  and then this one is a clone of that and what I want to do is I just want to kiss
[13:12.100 --> 13:15.940]  it with pollen in a couple of the bud sites so that I can make my own seeds
[13:15.940 --> 13:19.580]  I'm not going to use the hermaphrodite pollen from the other scene I've
[13:19.580 --> 13:22.820]  actually got a different pollen I'm going to use and I'll show you that in a
[13:22.820 --> 13:26.340]  second but in the meantime yeah so there's two gorilla glue autos going
[13:26.340 --> 13:29.740]  right there there's these two critical plants and then I got some pollen going
[13:29.740 --> 13:34.540]  in the next tent well almost going in the next tent so this is my 2x4 let me
[13:34.540 --> 13:39.620]  close this up real nice and tight so that I can be very intentional about
[13:39.620 --> 13:44.180]  where the pollen gets give me one second okay I'm so sorry about the blurple
[13:44.180 --> 13:47.900]  again like I'm just acquiring equipment and trying to make it work this is a
[13:47.980 --> 13:57.300]  night terror og plant from from warrior dankness out of Colorado so I I popped a
[13:57.300 --> 14:03.220]  couple of seeds and I ended up finding this male in here it is cool because um
[14:03.220 --> 14:07.100]  you know it's got a lot of characteristics that I like on a female
[14:07.100 --> 14:09.740]  like I like the way that this is stacking out and I really want to use
[14:09.740 --> 14:14.840]  the pollen from that so this is in the same room sadly so I mean maybe that's a
[14:14.840 --> 14:17.860]  big mistake is to have it in even in the same room even in two different tents
[14:17.860 --> 14:24.160]  everything is sealed up you can tell the zip ties on either of the all of the
[14:24.160 --> 14:27.160]  outside things so hopefully there's nothing leaking out of this except for
[14:27.160 --> 14:33.160]  when I open the tent and at that point you know hopefully we're not exposing
[14:33.160 --> 14:40.520]  things too long to to the air so yeah and the other tent is fully sealed every
[14:40.520 --> 14:47.140]  time that this gets open so that's the goal yeah the blurple light I'm sorry
[14:47.140 --> 14:51.880]  about that it really kind of sucks but you can see I got some boys in here
[14:51.880 --> 14:55.120]  we're gonna get the pollen out of this and I'm gonna just kiss a couple of the
[14:55.120 --> 14:59.560]  colas on the plant but I have going with the idea that then I've just got I'm set
[14:59.560 --> 15:06.960]  with my own seed for some amount of time because you know it's seeds not cheap
[15:06.960 --> 15:10.920]  and I'm not a cheap guy and I don't want to do this a cheap way but I'm also so
[15:10.920 --> 15:15.720]  interested in the in the characteristics of breeding and like what you might get
[15:15.720 --> 15:20.180]  and you know I'm a guy who likes to like just take projects and run with
[15:20.180 --> 15:25.040]  them so we're gonna give this a shot and see if we can make something something
[15:25.040 --> 15:32.980]  work yeah so that's all I got Peter let me know if you need me to record
[15:32.980 --> 15:40.180]  anything else and I'll be happy to talk ad nauseum about what my thoughts on on
[15:40.180 --> 15:45.700]  growing and all that kind of stuff thanks so much and have a great day
