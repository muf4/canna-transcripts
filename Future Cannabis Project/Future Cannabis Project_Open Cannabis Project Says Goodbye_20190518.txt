[00:00.000 --> 00:13.310]  Hi, I'm Beth Schechter. I'm the Executive Director of the Open Cannabis Project, which
[00:13.310 --> 00:19.950]  as many people know is closing on May 31st, 2019. I'm joined today by Dale Hunt, who is
[00:19.950 --> 00:27.950]  on my board and also who is a patent lawyer and botanist. Hi, Dale. We're at the Cultivation
[00:27.950 --> 00:35.830]  Classic. We just had our first and last legal advocacy, legal and advocacy clinic. You know,
[00:35.830 --> 00:40.590]  part of the reason we decided that we wanted to do this clinic is because, you know, as
[00:40.590 --> 00:46.070]  Open Cannabis Project has been happening for the past year and a half, one of the things
[00:46.070 --> 00:52.590]  that we've identified as a real need is a need for connecting growers and breeders with
[00:52.590 --> 00:57.950]  lawyers and legal resources. Lawyer fees are expensive, and so part of what we wanted
[00:57.950 --> 01:04.390]  to do with this legal clinic is to really create a resource that made legal content,
[01:04.390 --> 01:09.270]  legal educational content available to breeders and growers. Make it available, make it really
[01:09.270 --> 01:16.670]  affordable. It was a, you know, $12 to $24 sliding scale donation. All of those proceeds
[01:16.670 --> 01:21.790]  are going to the Craft Cannabis Alliance and to Vote Hemp. OCP is not taking any of those
[01:21.990 --> 01:26.710]  donations at this time or ever because we're going away. I felt like it was a success,
[01:26.710 --> 01:32.190]  and for people who weren't there, you know, we covered licenses and patents for strains,
[01:32.190 --> 01:37.830]  including some open source options. We covered interstate commerce, and we really talked about
[01:37.830 --> 01:43.470]  hemp and FDA. All of these matters, all of these laws are really complicated, and they
[01:43.470 --> 01:52.510]  surround us every day, and they impact us every single day. And, you know, part of the reason,
[01:52.510 --> 01:55.870]  you know, and I'll talk about Open Cannabis Project closing. I mean, as people know,
[01:55.870 --> 02:02.190]  there has been a big controversy that has been involved in Phylos, and that absolutely, and,
[02:02.190 --> 02:05.230]  you know, coming to light with some of the information that came through on that was
[02:05.230 --> 02:11.710]  a big reason why we closed. That's not the only reason, though. Another reason just had to do
[02:11.710 --> 02:15.790]  with, like, ongoing financial difficulty, which I think had to do with people not trusting us,
[02:15.790 --> 02:19.710]  which then had to do with this controversy, which was all the more reason to just be like,
[02:19.710 --> 02:26.190]  well, that doesn't seem like a battle that's worth fighting. But really, also, on top of that,
[02:26.190 --> 02:32.750]  part of the reason why we decided to close is because the conversation is shifting, and what
[02:32.750 --> 02:39.230]  we are realizing is our reality in cannabis is shifting. Part of what's happening right now is
[02:39.230 --> 02:46.510]  that we are grieving the death of an ideal, an ideal that mainstream cannabis would be a
[02:46.510 --> 02:50.830]  reflection of the people who brought it here. That's not what's happening. And because that's
[02:50.830 --> 02:55.790]  not what's happening, we have to take off our rose-colored glasses and do a better job of
[02:55.790 --> 03:02.670]  working together and organizing ourselves. And that involves not only, one, looking at the landscape
[03:02.670 --> 03:08.670]  very realistically. It also involves understanding what the law is, and understanding what the law is
[03:08.670 --> 03:14.110]  is hard. Understanding how technology works is hard. Understanding genetics and genetic data
[03:14.110 --> 03:20.350]  is very hard. And so it is, you know, it's understandable why people don't get it.
[03:21.070 --> 03:25.790]  At the same time, if we are going to organize from the ground up, and if we are going to really try
[03:25.790 --> 03:30.830]  to succeed right now, then part of what we have to do right now is we do have to have educated
[03:30.830 --> 03:35.710]  conversations, and we do have to understand the law. And so, you know, in order to have these
[03:35.710 --> 03:41.790]  educated conversations, we need to have lawyers help us to understand, like, what the F is actually
[03:41.790 --> 03:46.830]  going on in this country, in this state, in this jurisdiction, everywhere. And the fact that things
[03:46.830 --> 03:51.790]  are different by state by state, jurisdiction by jurisdiction, just doesn't help. So, you know,
[03:51.790 --> 03:56.670]  our hope had been prior to this legal clinic that this would be a key part of our programming going
[03:56.670 --> 04:02.750]  forward. And even though we're going away, there's definitely still demand for this, and we are
[04:02.750 --> 04:08.990]  talking to lawyers who are interested in helping with legal clinics like this. We had also begun
[04:08.990 --> 04:15.470]  a project where we were putting together standard open source and also commercial licenses for
[04:15.470 --> 04:20.590]  breeders and growers who wanted to license their strains. That work is also going to continue,
[04:21.630 --> 04:26.510]  and it will likely continue with new partners and new directions, and certainly be as, you know,
[04:26.510 --> 04:32.030]  democratic from the ground up as possible. But in any case, you know, that's a very, but you know,
[04:32.030 --> 04:35.630]  talking about legal resources for breeders and growers is a different conversation than
[04:36.190 --> 04:41.630]  open source your information, open source your strains, you know. Not to say that open source
[04:41.630 --> 04:45.470]  is really giving away your stuff for free, but a lot of people see it that way. It's just a different.
[04:45.470 --> 04:50.910]  That's what I'd like to talk about. Yeah. I had an idea just at lunch, and I thought, hey, let's put
[04:50.910 --> 04:57.550]  this in front of the camera. Because I have said, in fact, I said this at Emerald Cup on the panel
[04:57.550 --> 05:05.470]  that we were on, that there's a fundamental difference between open source copyright,
[05:05.470 --> 05:12.990]  open source software, and open source seeds. And I think that's the problem with everything people
[05:12.990 --> 05:19.710]  have promulgated so far with open source seed licenses. And that is that people are doing that
[05:19.710 --> 05:25.070]  in some way that's sort of like an alternative to intellectual property protection. And here's
[05:25.070 --> 05:33.310]  the difference. With open source software, that is, that starts with a fundamental pre-existence
[05:33.310 --> 05:39.790]  of intellectual property rights. Because software, software has copyright as soon as you create it.
[05:40.510 --> 05:47.550]  Copyright exists as soon as you create software. And that's because there's an international
[05:47.550 --> 05:52.510]  convention to that effect. On the other hand, people don't have intellectual property as soon
[05:52.510 --> 05:57.550]  as they create a plant variety. That's the problem. And so...
[05:57.550 --> 06:04.660]  It's not automatically assigned. Yeah. With copyright, the copyright is assumed to be yours.
[06:04.660 --> 06:09.540]  You grow a plant, you have to have more of a, just more of a process, right?
[06:09.540 --> 06:16.580]  Right. And so if you just optimistically or altruistically put your seeds out there in some
[06:16.580 --> 06:22.180]  sort of an open source system, it's an honor system. It's a trust system. And it requires
[06:22.180 --> 06:29.620]  some kind of community cooperation that is only as strong as all of the members
[06:29.620 --> 06:38.500]  cooperating in that system. So this thought I had at lunch was this. This whole copyright system
[06:38.500 --> 06:44.180]  didn't exist until there was an international convention to that effect. And that's only
[06:44.180 --> 06:47.380]  a generation old. Maybe a little bit more than a generation.
[06:47.460 --> 06:51.460]  You don't have to actually go and register it. Exactly. Exactly. When I was in law school or
[06:51.460 --> 06:57.540]  just coming out of law school, that was relatively new, at least in the US. It used to be that you
[06:57.540 --> 07:04.900]  had to register your copyright before you had any copyrights. So why not... Why don't we agitate for
[07:05.620 --> 07:10.500]  some breeder's rights that exist as soon as you do the breeding? In other words,
[07:11.140 --> 07:21.540]  we could create some massive system where there is this huge honor system among everybody who
[07:21.540 --> 07:26.420]  participates in an open source breeding system, but it's only as good as the least honorable
[07:26.420 --> 07:31.460]  member of that system. And gee, are there any dishonorable members of the cannabis community?
[07:32.020 --> 07:41.620]  There might be a few. Or as long as we're lobbying for change, why don't we lobby for some kind of
[07:41.620 --> 07:49.380]  an international convention for inherent rights of plant breeders that they have a right to the
[07:49.380 --> 07:56.260]  ownership of their cultivars as soon as they're created? Just like copyright. It might be crazy,
[07:56.260 --> 08:02.020]  but why not? It's worth considering. That is an amazing idea, and I think that that would help.
[08:02.740 --> 08:09.140]  I wonder though, are there... Now I wondered law student questions, not that I'm a law student,
[08:09.140 --> 08:16.820]  but it's like, okay, is there an existing reason in place why inventorship is not automatically
[08:16.820 --> 08:22.340]  assigned to other things anyway, including plants? Is this something that has been considered and
[08:22.340 --> 08:32.420]  rejected because of X or Y? I don't know. It could be hard to prove, but on the other hand,
[08:34.500 --> 08:38.180]  I don't know, maybe nobody's just ever asked the question. I don't want to give myself that much
[08:38.180 --> 08:44.260]  credit for being original, but... I think it's a good idea and it's worth pursuing.
[08:44.740 --> 08:51.220]  It's worth considering as an option. See, one of the differences between a utility patent and a
[08:51.220 --> 08:56.260]  plant patent is there's quite a bit of debate with a utility patent about whether what you
[08:56.260 --> 09:02.420]  think you invented is actually new, right? And so that's the purpose of a patent examiner. You have
[09:02.420 --> 09:06.900]  to go through this whole elaborate examination process to prove that what you think you invented
[09:06.900 --> 09:13.700]  is new. They have to do this examination, they do a search, they look at all the so-called prior art,
[09:14.260 --> 09:18.580]  and you establish whether it's new. On the other hand, if you breed a plant,
[09:20.740 --> 09:27.780]  pretty much by statistical definition, whatever you do in that breeding process is new. The genetic
[09:27.780 --> 09:36.660]  act of doing a sexual cross and creating a new cultivar, a new cross, it's not necessarily a
[09:36.660 --> 09:43.140]  cultivar until it's stable, but that new strain, that F1, is genetically new. Statistically,
[09:43.140 --> 09:49.460]  it's impossible that it's not new. And so that's original. It's the same theory of copyright. If I
[09:49.460 --> 09:56.100]  create something, if I write something new, as long as it's long enough to be new, it's original.
[09:57.060 --> 10:06.100]  So the originality is what constitutes its being deserving of a copyright. And to me, at least,
[10:06.900 --> 10:11.460]  you know, in my post-lunch addled brain, it seems like...
[10:11.460 --> 10:12.980]  I felt just like a writer this morning.
[10:12.980 --> 10:18.420]  Yeah, it seems like, at least theoretically, you've cleared the novelty hurdle, the originality
[10:18.420 --> 10:24.900]  hurdle. There's no examination process needed. So as long as you can establish ownership,
[10:25.780 --> 10:32.580]  you should be entitled to your rights, just like a copyright. And if you have the automatic
[10:32.580 --> 10:38.260]  existence of some intellectual property, then you should be able to have an open source system
[10:38.260 --> 10:45.380]  that would actually work. And so then, you know, I've been dubious about open source systems for
[10:45.380 --> 10:52.180]  seeds, which is why I haven't really jumped into it. Not because I don't support it, just because
[10:52.180 --> 10:53.220]  of its workability.
[10:53.220 --> 10:56.580]  Yeah, that's true. We've had a lot of debates about open source seeds.
[10:56.820 --> 11:03.620]  I'm in favor of it in concept. I've been dubious about its workability because it's only as
[11:05.780 --> 11:14.500]  workable as its least honorable member. But, you know, this could work in a very similar way to
[11:14.500 --> 11:15.460]  open source software.
[11:15.460 --> 11:21.860]  That's cool. Well, that is one idea. There are many ideas out there. Many ideas out there. And
[11:21.860 --> 11:27.460]  I know that people have thoughts, feelings. We've heard from a ton of people who've said that they
[11:27.460 --> 11:34.500]  are sad that Open Cannabis Project is closing. We hear you. We're sad, too. And I think we're
[11:34.500 --> 11:41.540]  also ready to let go of some baggage and move forward in some nimbler ways, and to do so from
[11:41.540 --> 11:47.300]  the community up. And so for people who are interested in thinking about these ideas,
[11:47.300 --> 11:54.900]  being part of the next step, one, go to opencannabisproject.org. There is one very simple
[11:54.900 --> 12:01.940]  survey now that we are going to be putting out some more going forward. But there's a simple
[12:01.940 --> 12:08.500]  sort of sunset survey right now. And if you have thoughts about what we should do after we close,
[12:08.500 --> 12:12.900]  we'd love to hear them. And, you know, if you have just general thoughts, send us a note at
[12:12.900 --> 12:18.660]  info at opencannabisproject.org. We look forward to hearing from you and to building
[12:18.660 --> 12:34.260]  something new together. It's already kind of... The seeds are planted. Things are happening.
