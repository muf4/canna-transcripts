[00:00.060 --> 00:04.380]  All right, so you had, so what was the question?
[00:04.380 --> 00:11.440]  Oh, Chris is very frozen right now.
[00:11.440 --> 00:16.240]  I had mentioned how, just to, you know, we were just talking off camera about the hunting
[00:16.240 --> 00:17.240]  and searching.
[00:17.240 --> 00:21.280]  I had mentioned that I popped about 30 seeds this morning.
[00:21.280 --> 00:23.280]  You back, Chris?
[00:23.280 --> 00:24.280]  Mm-hmm.
[00:24.280 --> 00:25.280]  Yep.
[00:25.280 --> 00:27.800]  And you're curious which ones, right?
[00:27.800 --> 00:30.800]  Yeah, yeah, what are you hunting, man?
[00:30.800 --> 00:35.560]  So I'd already looked through a couple of the Wilson Zero Honey Banana.
[00:35.560 --> 00:40.920]  I was very, very impressed from such a small population what was coming out.
[00:40.920 --> 00:44.960]  So I was highly motivated to search through again, even if it was another limited small
[00:44.960 --> 00:49.880]  population just because such marvelous things coming out.
[00:49.880 --> 00:58.880]  I did about 12 Cuban Black Haze crossed with the Animal Mints, which I think they kind
[00:58.880 --> 01:00.840]  of don't go together, which is why I like them.
[01:00.840 --> 01:06.520]  A lot of people who are like pro-haze or anti-cookies, so I kind of like that those are mingled together
[01:06.520 --> 01:09.160]  because I love just about everything.
[01:09.160 --> 01:14.640]  And the last one is Dude Pivco's interpretation on sour diesel.
[01:14.640 --> 01:19.120]  And I know it's a long shot, but I'm going through, I think I got 12 or 13 of those just
[01:19.120 --> 01:21.760]  to see if anything interesting comes out.
[01:21.760 --> 01:22.760]  Awesome.
[01:22.760 --> 01:27.960]  A lot of people are trying to find that original sour diesel and hunt through to find, you
[01:28.040 --> 01:32.560]  know, the one that was similar to those late nineties, early 2000s sours that it really
[01:32.560 --> 01:33.560]  got people excited.
[01:33.560 --> 01:34.560]  So, yeah.
[01:34.560 --> 01:36.080]  He has it for sure.
[01:36.080 --> 01:37.320]  I smoked his flower.
[01:37.320 --> 01:41.440]  He was gracious enough to gift me an eighth of his sour and me and my cousin who both
[01:41.440 --> 01:45.440]  kind of grew up with it, we did all the tests we could and it checked all the boxes.
[01:45.440 --> 01:48.400]  We died it out four times and relit it.
[01:48.400 --> 01:53.320]  And by the last time it was this big, it's still that first bubble, just drop your shoulders.
[01:53.320 --> 01:57.600]  The first hit that I had, I couldn't even exhale it when I was already screaming.
[01:58.240 --> 02:03.640]  It was like smoke, you know, I was, you know, yelling and I was that much excitement from
[02:03.640 --> 02:04.640]  the first inhale.
[02:04.640 --> 02:05.640]  It was all there.
[02:05.640 --> 02:07.040]  Like I was really just screaming.
[02:07.040 --> 02:09.280]  So I think it's still super recessive.
[02:09.280 --> 02:14.000]  I think he hunted through a whole big population to find it or probably got re gifted it.
[02:14.000 --> 02:16.560]  But I think it's worth a swing anyways.
[02:16.560 --> 02:17.560]  Cool.
[02:17.560 --> 02:23.960]  So just quickly to give everyone some context, Chris and I have been going back and forth
[02:23.960 --> 02:26.920]  for a couple of months trying to lock down a date to do this.
[02:26.920 --> 02:29.320]  It's a presentation he had given in person.
[02:29.320 --> 02:34.840]  It's my radar and I was like, let's do it again.
[02:34.840 --> 02:38.400]  It is torrential downpours in California right now.
[02:38.400 --> 02:45.440]  So it actually the sun, the clouds parted down here in L.A. but where Chris is up in
[02:45.440 --> 02:46.920]  where are you in NorCal?
[02:46.920 --> 02:47.920]  San Francisco.
[02:47.920 --> 02:48.920]  Okay.
[02:48.920 --> 02:49.920]  All right.
[02:49.920 --> 02:52.160]  So it is still pouring right there, right?
[02:52.160 --> 02:53.160]  Yep.
[02:53.160 --> 02:54.160]  Yeah.
[02:54.160 --> 02:55.160]  I think we might have a little bit of a lull.
[02:55.400 --> 02:57.200]  You look better than you've looked the entire time.
[02:57.200 --> 02:59.040]  So he was all glitchy before.
[02:59.040 --> 03:02.040]  But anyway, if it's glitchy, it's because of the rain.
[03:02.040 --> 03:03.040]  All right.
[03:03.040 --> 03:04.040]  Cool.
[03:04.040 --> 03:07.520]  So with that, I'm going to listen, but I'm going to jump off and you're in good hands
[03:07.520 --> 03:09.520]  with the good lobster.
[03:09.520 --> 03:10.520]  Cool.
[03:10.520 --> 03:15.240]  Well, I'll just I'll just start off with the presentation and then, you know, Travis, jump
[03:15.240 --> 03:21.640]  in if you want to, you know, anywhere you see appropriate to help guide this.
[03:21.640 --> 03:27.920]  So, yeah, so I did present this at Grow Generation in L.A. and thank you to them.
[03:27.920 --> 03:32.920]  You know, the first thing I want to do is say thank you to, you know, Future Cannabis
[03:32.920 --> 03:38.520]  Project for having me today, everyone in attendance and everyone who watches this, as well as
[03:38.520 --> 03:42.500]  Node Labs and Compounds Genetics for just giving me the opportunity to learn so much
[03:42.500 --> 03:44.320]  in this field.
[03:44.320 --> 03:49.520]  And then, of course, thank all the all the growers and all the OG growers, everyone who's
[03:49.920 --> 03:52.600]  taught me a tip or a trick.
[03:52.600 --> 03:56.760]  And and we're really all the growers today are standing on the shoulders of giants, of
[03:56.760 --> 04:01.260]  people who really, like, pioneered how to grow this plant.
[04:01.260 --> 04:06.160]  And so I'm very excited to be part of, you know, the future of this of this plant.
[04:06.160 --> 04:08.400]  And phenohunting is a huge part of that.
[04:08.400 --> 04:12.520]  So let's get into it.
[04:12.520 --> 04:17.800]  Just to introduce myself, I went to the University of Vermont studying evolutionary biology.
[04:18.080 --> 04:23.680]  I was a botanist for the for the state of California and kind of a self-trained tissue
[04:23.680 --> 04:25.760]  culture scientist.
[04:25.760 --> 04:28.320]  I love plants, huge plant nerd.
[04:28.320 --> 04:33.760]  I currently work as the main breeder and selector for Compound Genetics and the CSO of Node
[04:33.760 --> 04:36.120]  Labs.
[04:36.120 --> 04:40.360]  Chris Lynch and I worked together for the past three years and he taught me so much
[04:40.360 --> 04:42.600]  about this process.
[04:42.600 --> 04:48.000]  And we've been working together to do make compound genetic strains since then hunted
[04:48.000 --> 04:49.320]  a bunch of seed lines.
[04:49.320 --> 04:56.080]  And so I just think just this year we've hunted like that over a thousand seeds in in-house
[04:56.080 --> 05:02.600]  and about three or three to five thousand total with partners and other other people.
[05:02.600 --> 05:07.000]  We've stabilized hundreds of clones into our tissue culture lab.
[05:07.160 --> 05:12.600]  That's really what we do at Node Labs is we hunt gear with breeders and then we initiate
[05:12.600 --> 05:17.400]  it into the tissue culture laboratory and then have it available for commercial growers.
[05:17.400 --> 05:23.760]  And then you can see some of these more influential clones throughout the years that have been
[05:23.760 --> 05:28.420]  a part of either breeding and being right part of the, you know, chucking the pollen
[05:28.420 --> 05:31.200]  or stabilizing the clone of and getting the tissue culture.
[05:31.200 --> 05:32.200]  So yeah.
[05:32.200 --> 05:35.560]  Travis, you have any questions so far?
[05:36.400 --> 05:38.160]  I like this is Peter.
[05:38.160 --> 05:42.880]  I like you don't have the pen in your front pocket.
[05:42.880 --> 05:43.880]  You have the scissors.
[05:46.000 --> 05:50.600]  I think I think Aroya got that picture during a like a highlight they have coming out and
[05:50.600 --> 05:54.800]  I was literally like in the midst of some sort of like actual work.
[05:54.800 --> 05:55.800]  And they're like, take a picture.
[05:55.800 --> 05:58.280]  I was like, OK, that was not staged.
[05:58.280 --> 05:59.280]  Shockingly.
[06:00.360 --> 06:04.960]  OK, no real questions yet, but as far as who you are.
[06:04.960 --> 06:08.200]  I spent a bunch of my life in St. Johnsbury and in SF.
[06:08.200 --> 06:11.320]  So as far as the who am I, I'm digging it.
[06:11.320 --> 06:12.320]  Awesome.
[06:12.320 --> 06:13.320]  Oh, very cool.
[06:13.320 --> 06:14.320]  Yeah.
[06:14.320 --> 06:15.320]  Vermont, man.
[06:15.320 --> 06:16.320]  I love Vermont.
[06:16.320 --> 06:17.720]  But cool.
[06:17.720 --> 06:19.240]  So what is phenohunt?
[06:19.240 --> 06:20.720]  Why do we do it?
[06:20.720 --> 06:25.680]  You know, seeds when you pop seeds, every single one is different.
[06:25.680 --> 06:28.680]  And it's like it's like brothers and sisters in your family.
[06:28.680 --> 06:31.920]  Like you have the same parents, but you look different and you know, you're related, but
[06:31.920 --> 06:34.320]  you're not the same person.
[06:34.680 --> 06:37.680]  So the clones obviously are genetically identical.
[06:37.680 --> 06:41.680]  And so they behave a lot more, a lot more similarly.
[06:41.680 --> 06:46.880]  And really, you know, the the industry, the commercial growing of cannabis relies a lot
[06:46.880 --> 06:51.480]  on clones because, you know, the expression is uniform.
[06:51.480 --> 06:58.080]  So phenohunting is kind of a combined effort of growing the seeds, observing the phenotypes
[06:58.080 --> 07:05.400]  simultaneously retaining a clone from those from those original seedlings and then matching
[07:05.400 --> 07:10.320]  whatever is the best seed phenotype in the flowering room to the clone.
[07:10.320 --> 07:15.440]  And then, you know, and then working on that line to make a stabilized clone.
[07:15.440 --> 07:19.840]  So again, phenohunting, seed germination, phenotyping and clone stabilization.
[07:19.840 --> 07:25.120]  These are kind of like agriculture words like phenotyping and then clone stabilization is
[07:25.120 --> 07:30.200]  kind of like ag words you'd see in a university or something.
[07:30.200 --> 07:33.960]  So here's a cool example of this.
[07:33.960 --> 07:38.920]  Here's when we phenohunted mellows, which is a spritzer by Grape Castellane.
[07:38.920 --> 07:40.120]  Awesome, awesome line.
[07:40.120 --> 07:42.920]  You can see that there's a lot of different expressions in between these.
[07:42.920 --> 07:50.520]  So just as a little highlight, we could see the mellows eight on the left has like kind of a small bud.
[07:50.560 --> 07:56.040]  It is very purple, has kind of a small bud morphology and is more compact.
[07:56.040 --> 08:02.240]  The mellows seven also has that purple, but it has huge big buds that kind of build on each other, less compact.
[08:02.240 --> 08:06.840]  And then the mellows 14 also has that compact, but has a little bit of a different color to it.
[08:06.840 --> 08:11.320]  You can see it's like magenta instead of kind of like dark purple or gray.
[08:11.320 --> 08:16.360]  It's more magenta. So these sister can be wildly different.
[08:16.360 --> 08:22.360]  And just for the people at home, just to illustrate that, these are three clone selections we made from a phenohunt.
[08:25.000 --> 08:32.960]  So I talked a little bit about this before, you know, phenohunting like clones are king because of the quality and character being so important.
[08:32.960 --> 08:36.800]  When you're selling a batch of cannabis, you want it to all perform the same.
[08:36.800 --> 08:38.600]  So you want a jar here and a jar there.
[08:38.600 --> 08:43.320]  It should be the same experience. And you have to have clones for that, really.
[08:43.320 --> 08:48.000]  Another one that's kind of a sleeper for non-growers is canopy management.
[08:48.000 --> 08:54.160]  A couple of traits that can be wildly different among sisters is like stretch or veg speed.
[08:54.160 --> 09:01.240]  And, you know, indoor growers especially know that if you just have a slight difference in canopy height,
[09:01.240 --> 09:07.120]  it's going to dramatically affect the value of it or like the quality of the of the buds.
[09:07.160 --> 09:10.920]  And you get those really great yields when you have a really dialed in system,
[09:10.920 --> 09:13.680]  as well as having clones that all behave exactly the same.
[09:15.840 --> 09:22.520]  Variability of expression, obviously, you know, you want it to taste the same and affect you in the same way.
[09:22.520 --> 09:30.960]  So if we're really looking for even recreational or medicinal value, you want it to be, you know, impact you in a consistent way.
[09:31.000 --> 09:35.800]  And then novelty, this is kind of another sleeper, like counterintuitive thing, right?
[09:38.360 --> 09:43.720]  It's actually easier to make clone lines that are a lot different than seed lines that are a lot different.
[09:43.720 --> 09:47.640]  The variability amongst plants in a seed line is going to be a lot different.
[09:47.640 --> 09:52.840]  But if you really want to give the market something new and put it in a jar as a brand,
[09:52.840 --> 10:00.200]  it's easier to make a new clone to do that than to make a new seed line that performs at those rigors.
[10:00.200 --> 10:04.920]  And we can talk about why, but yeah, this is just how it works.
[10:04.920 --> 10:06.480]  Clones are king.
[10:06.480 --> 10:12.160]  How do you feel about running a clone for your initial round?
[10:12.160 --> 10:16.640]  Me personally, I like to take two cuttings off of the seedling.
[10:16.640 --> 10:25.840]  I keep one cutting as the backup and then flower one cutting immediately and then usually throw away or give away the seedling as long as I have a solid backup.
[10:25.840 --> 10:27.480]  Any thoughts on that?
[10:27.480 --> 10:29.160]  That's a great question.
[10:29.160 --> 10:31.920]  Yeah, I think that's a great practice.
[10:31.920 --> 10:36.160]  It definitely makes the timeline a little longer than typical,
[10:36.160 --> 10:41.040]  because if you're talking about a rooted and strong seedling that you're taking clones off of,
[10:41.040 --> 10:45.240]  you can get that plant flipped faster than its corresponding clone.
[10:45.240 --> 10:49.000]  And right, like so you're kind of subtracting two weeks off the process.
[10:49.000 --> 10:52.520]  So if you're trying to do like high throughput, it's going to be a little different.
[10:52.520 --> 10:57.000]  But the clone, the clone behaves a little differently than the seedling.
[10:57.040 --> 10:59.320]  You get better data.
[10:59.320 --> 11:00.480]  You get much better data.
[11:00.480 --> 11:03.960]  Exactly. You know how it will behave in the future a lot better.
[11:03.960 --> 11:08.880]  And then you avoid a couple of traits that are kind of endemic to seedlings.
[11:08.880 --> 11:13.440]  Two traits. Number one, the nodes are parallel.
[11:13.440 --> 11:18.880]  So the nodes typically originate from the same location, parallel fashion instead of alternating.
[11:18.880 --> 11:21.440]  And two, you don't get the same.
[11:21.760 --> 11:28.240]  There is a phytohormone called gibberellins that are more present in seedlings than in clones.
[11:28.240 --> 11:33.760]  And that makes more apical dominance like a bigger top bud than typical.
[11:33.760 --> 11:35.800]  So that's a great call.
[11:35.800 --> 11:43.840]  And I would recommend doing that, although for the home hobbyist, that might be a little bit difficult.
[11:43.840 --> 11:49.040]  And you're also screening through success of that clone taking.
[11:49.040 --> 11:54.320]  So if you might not end up running phenotypes that didn't clone well because of time.
[11:54.320 --> 11:57.920]  So that's kind of interesting, Rachel.
[11:57.920 --> 12:00.720]  Did that answer your question, Travis?
[12:00.720 --> 12:02.720]  Absolutely. I appreciate it.
[12:02.720 --> 12:06.480]  I love the point on how there's symmetric growth when there's seedlings.
[12:06.480 --> 12:14.560]  I feel like that can be very deceiving and just give mixed data on how it's going to perform for the rest of eternity if you're going to keep it.
[12:14.560 --> 12:18.960]  Absolutely. You don't really get bud structure or like you don't get like the proper structure yet.
[12:19.680 --> 12:25.680]  So what I wanted to talk about today is the underlying process and principles of phenohunting.
[12:25.680 --> 12:29.680]  Seed germination, keeping clone backups, selection process.
[12:29.680 --> 12:33.680]  And then if we have time, we can talk about some advanced techniques in phenohunting.
[12:33.680 --> 12:42.160]  This process really intrigues me because there's so many different ways to do it.
[12:42.160 --> 12:48.160]  And depending on your setup and how much bandwidth you have and time and lights and everything.
[12:48.800 --> 12:51.040]  You might employ a bunch of different strategies.
[12:51.040 --> 12:52.720]  And I think that's just fascinating.
[12:52.720 --> 12:54.400]  So we're going to talk a lot about that today.
[12:55.760 --> 13:04.800]  So the first part of this that I really like, and my team would probably say I'm a little overzealous about, is choosing a target.
[13:05.680 --> 13:12.960]  You shouldn't just like get seeds or if you're trying to make seeds, if you're breeding seeds and then in trying to select a clone and that, you should have like a plan.
[13:13.600 --> 13:18.960]  Because different, you're going to employ a different strategy depending on what plan you put down or put in there.
[13:19.520 --> 13:29.280]  And everyone has a limit on how much money they can spend and time they can spend to work through this, you know, the phenohunting process.
[13:29.840 --> 13:34.880]  And so you should really like dedicate your time and efforts on the stage that are going to make the most impact.
[13:36.480 --> 13:38.480]  So, you know, what do we mean by a target?
[13:38.480 --> 13:41.200]  Like, you know, you cross two things.
[13:41.200 --> 13:42.400]  Like, let's talk about that.
[13:43.760 --> 13:44.560]  What is it called again?
[13:44.560 --> 13:47.360]  Honey, what were the crosses you're hunting?
[13:47.360 --> 13:48.720]  The Wilson Zero by...
[13:48.720 --> 13:51.200]  Yeah, Honey Banana Wilson Zero.
[13:51.200 --> 13:57.760]  I feel like the Cuban Black Haze and the Animal Mints are a good example because they're so polarized.
[13:57.760 --> 14:02.880]  Where to me it would have a nice cookie inhale and a nice hazy exhale.
[14:03.520 --> 14:06.960]  So that's just from, you know, an uneducated approach.
[14:06.960 --> 14:08.720]  But like, that's what I'll kind of be looking for.
[14:08.720 --> 14:12.080]  I want not so much of a balanced flavor and inhale and exhale.
[14:12.080 --> 14:19.040]  I want like a little bit of diversity and with a nice calming effect, but still like functional, like from the Cuban Black, you know.
[14:19.520 --> 14:25.840]  Okay, so it sounds like most of the criteria you're going for are based on the experience of the smoke, right?
[14:25.840 --> 14:30.720]  Which means that you're going to keep, you should keep all or most of these phenotypes regardless how they grow.
[14:31.280 --> 14:36.960]  And get them all dried, all cured, all trimmed up, maybe even all CO8 and all smoke test.
[14:36.960 --> 14:45.760]  And you should really focus on the sensory and smoke test portion of that to like successfully and like do the best job you can to hunt that line, right?
[14:46.320 --> 14:59.520]  Which means that you shouldn't put, dedicate that much effort into screening for veg speed or plant morphology or yield or like sensitivity to light or susceptibility to bud rot, stuff like that, right?
[14:59.520 --> 15:03.520]  So that's sort of an example, a great example of like choosing the target.
[15:05.040 --> 15:07.680]  And then we can create a strategy based on that target.
[15:08.960 --> 15:14.400]  And again, this is coming from someone who like has to juggle a lot of resources in pheno hunting.
[15:14.400 --> 15:16.720]  So it's kind of like we can never do it all.
[15:16.720 --> 15:24.560]  We can never have everyone chat, you know, like screen every single plant for every single trait at every single stage.
[15:25.120 --> 15:28.480]  And what we want to do is dedicate our resources and focus.
[15:28.480 --> 15:29.120]  Whoops.
[15:29.120 --> 15:30.000]  Oh, okay.
[15:30.640 --> 15:32.880]  Just went way to the end.
[15:35.040 --> 15:35.760]  Give me a second.
[15:40.380 --> 15:41.180]  Sorry, folks.
[15:41.180 --> 15:41.420]  Okay.
[15:41.420 --> 15:42.380]  I don't know what happened there.
[15:44.620 --> 15:49.900]  That's one thing I actually wanted to touch on when you get, when I'm sure you'll get to it is like, what's the fine line?
[15:49.900 --> 15:57.500]  You know, it's like, yes, you can go through a hundred thousand seeds, but you're not going to be able to even meet 10% of them maybe.
[15:57.500 --> 16:03.340]  So what's the point where you could go through a 10 pack, but you're not going to have enough first dates to mingle enough.
[16:03.340 --> 16:08.700]  So I'd love to know where you think like those kind of like risk to reward lines are.
[16:08.700 --> 16:09.180]  That's intriguing.
[16:09.180 --> 16:09.660]  Absolutely.
[16:10.220 --> 16:11.580]  Well, I'll have a whole slide on that.
[16:11.580 --> 16:12.620]  And that's a great question.
[16:13.820 --> 16:16.060]  So first we'll talk about analysis of grow conditions.
[16:16.060 --> 16:17.660]  So like, yeah, okay.
[16:17.660 --> 16:22.300]  Let's start about, if we're trying to hunt something, how many flowering slots do we have?
[16:22.300 --> 16:23.260]  What is our grow style?
[16:23.900 --> 16:25.580]  How much bandwidth do we have?
[16:25.660 --> 16:30.540]  Is our team like, you know, is our, if we're, are we doing the loan as a hobbyist and we can check this every day?
[16:30.540 --> 16:32.220]  Would we want something more low maintenance?
[16:32.220 --> 16:33.580]  All these things like factor in.
[16:33.580 --> 16:35.420]  So we're going to blow through that.
[16:37.260 --> 16:44.860]  Analyzing the parents, knowing a little bit about the parents gives you a huge leg up in the pheno hunting process.
[16:44.860 --> 16:49.980]  You can't really get like a strong target if you haven't grown the parents or don't know anything about the parents.
[16:49.980 --> 17:02.860]  And I really think at this point in seed buyers, and if you're getting seeds, it's really incumbent on the breeder to be able to tell you nearly everything about the parents to really tell you like what this is going to be.
[17:04.460 --> 17:12.860]  And so, you know, asking ourselves these questions of saying, you know, what are the dominant terpenes?
[17:12.860 --> 17:13.660]  How does it grow?
[17:13.660 --> 17:15.340]  Is it a fast veg, slow veg?
[17:15.340 --> 17:16.540]  Is it susceptible to this?
[17:17.580 --> 17:18.540]  Does it herm?
[17:18.540 --> 17:19.180]  Things like that.
[17:19.180 --> 17:19.500]  Right.
[17:20.220 --> 17:27.980]  So a couple of the things we really want to avoid when analyzing the parents is, and this is written down here, avoid these.
[17:27.980 --> 17:32.220]  Lack of aroma, like don't grow stuff that doesn't have good terp.
[17:32.220 --> 17:33.740]  Oh, but I'll cross something with good terps.
[17:34.700 --> 17:40.140]  That is like one of those traits that if you can't get rid of it, it messes up.
[17:40.140 --> 17:41.660]  Like there's no point in keeping that.
[17:41.660 --> 17:43.180]  Oh, it's like, so look how beautiful it is.
[17:43.180 --> 17:44.220]  Oh, it doesn't smell good.
[17:44.220 --> 17:45.340]  It doesn't have that experience.
[17:45.340 --> 17:46.780]  Like ditch it.
[17:47.420 --> 17:51.980]  Obviously, high herm propensity, intersex traits, no good.
[17:51.980 --> 17:55.900]  Low THC testing can be shockingly difficult to like breed out.
[17:56.540 --> 18:03.340]  Excessive foxtailing and long plowering times are all things that like don't dig too much into those lines.
[18:03.340 --> 18:04.780]  They're too difficult to get out.
[18:07.420 --> 18:11.580]  I'm not going to touch on this too much, but you can see we kind of, we did that nice, you know,
[18:11.580 --> 18:13.660]  Travis, your example is a nice example of this.
[18:13.660 --> 18:22.060]  But like what you're talking about right there is a great example of like, okay, let's focus
[18:22.060 --> 18:26.540]  on those final, let's focus on those final stages of sensory and COA testing.
[18:26.540 --> 18:26.780]  Right.
[18:27.340 --> 18:32.460]  However, if you're trying to get a high yielder, we're going to really focus our efforts on like
[18:32.460 --> 18:36.300]  analyzing the bud structure and the plants in that actual flowering stage, like while
[18:36.300 --> 18:37.500]  they're in the nursery and stuff.
[18:37.500 --> 18:37.740]  Right.
[18:38.140 --> 18:44.460]  So that's just an illustration of strategy and being a very important part of juggling resources.
[18:46.460 --> 18:47.020]  Okay.
[18:47.020 --> 18:49.660]  This is what you touched on earlier, Travis.
[18:49.660 --> 18:55.580]  And I want to like make this type of lexicon, like these type of words and how we use them
[18:55.580 --> 19:02.140]  kind of typical in cannabis, but an average phenotype versus anomalous phenotype.
[19:02.140 --> 19:02.460]  Okay.
[19:02.460 --> 19:03.180]  What do I mean by that?
[19:03.660 --> 19:08.700]  You know, if you have, you have mom and dad, and then they have a child, they're, you know,
[19:08.700 --> 19:11.500]  likely they're just going to look a little bit like mom, a little bit like dad.
[19:11.500 --> 19:11.820]  Cool.
[19:11.820 --> 19:12.460]  Right.
[19:12.460 --> 19:16.300]  If you want something that's a really odd ball or unique, you probably need to hunt through
[19:16.300 --> 19:17.340]  a lot more seeds.
[19:17.340 --> 19:17.900]  Right.
[19:18.460 --> 19:24.140]  So without getting into the like genetics, actually how this works genetically, which
[19:24.140 --> 19:25.340]  we can't get into at the end here.
[19:26.780 --> 19:31.180]  If you just want the average phenotype, like, oh, I wonder what honey banana and will still
[19:31.180 --> 19:33.740]  I wonder what honey banana and Wilson zero looked like.
[19:33.740 --> 19:36.860]  Well, I like traits from honey banana and I like traits from Wilson zero.
[19:37.660 --> 19:38.780]  You don't need that many seeds.
[19:39.340 --> 19:41.260]  Like you can have really successful hunts.
[19:41.260 --> 19:46.220]  And some of the best strains in the world are from like 10 seeds, like bag seeds, three
[19:46.220 --> 19:48.060]  seeds, five seeds, 10 seeds.
[19:48.060 --> 19:51.820]  I mean, I would recommend 10 to 50 seeds for an average hunt.
[19:51.820 --> 19:57.740]  And our average hunt is like 25 seeds from a seed line, but I would rather hunt more
[19:57.740 --> 20:00.780]  different seed lines than more seeds from the same line.
[20:02.140 --> 20:02.860]  Does that make sense?
[20:05.980 --> 20:06.700]  Absolutely.
[20:07.260 --> 20:10.300]  I I've noticed that just from experience as well.
[20:10.300 --> 20:16.140]  I just went through a population of about 50 and there was only one that was clear cut.
[20:16.140 --> 20:18.780]  Like it was very, very close to the mother.
[20:18.780 --> 20:22.780]  You know, it had all of the good and bad things associated with it.
[20:22.780 --> 20:24.860]  And there was only one like that.
[20:24.860 --> 20:29.180]  Like you said, you know, a 10 pack, you'd only have a 20% chance if that's what you
[20:29.180 --> 20:30.060]  were looking for.
[20:30.140 --> 20:33.820]  So I think that's the sweet spot as well, you know, just from experience.
[20:34.460 --> 20:38.460]  And like compound genetics, seed packs, like we sell 13 seeds per pack.
[20:39.180 --> 20:43.740]  We're fully confident that if you buy one pack, you'll get a keeper clone that you really
[20:43.740 --> 20:44.700]  like that you can grow.
[20:45.820 --> 20:48.060]  That's when we do our testing and stuff, that's the whole point.
[20:48.060 --> 20:48.700]  Right.
[20:48.700 --> 20:52.860]  So when I, if I say, oh, you really need a hundred seeds and that, that kind of is like,
[20:52.860 --> 20:54.700]  well, then why are you selling 13 seed packs?
[20:54.700 --> 20:58.700]  It's like, I feel like if you're looking for the anomalous one, like you said, like out
[20:58.700 --> 21:04.460]  of the 50, I think I probably got 20 females to the end of flower that made it that far.
[21:04.460 --> 21:07.180]  And 10 of them are interesting enough to run again.
[21:07.180 --> 21:12.540]  So it's almost like a whole fresh hunt, you know, so I can do like an average one to get
[21:12.540 --> 21:12.860]  in there.
[21:12.860 --> 21:15.420]  You would find one you'd most likely be happy with.
[21:15.420 --> 21:20.140]  It might be a little fruitier, a little hazier, this, that, or the other, but there was winners
[21:20.140 --> 21:20.780]  left and right.
[21:20.780 --> 21:22.220]  But that one was the only one.
[21:22.220 --> 21:26.940]  It was just like a picture of like, you know, it's one, it was just there.
[21:27.660 --> 21:28.460]  Definitely.
[21:28.460 --> 21:32.140]  So yeah, so that's, that's like typically what people are doing, hobbyists and everything
[21:32.140 --> 21:33.180]  is average phenotype.
[21:34.060 --> 21:37.100]  Anomalous phenotype, you're usually looking for recessive traits.
[21:37.100 --> 21:40.940]  So a really good example of this would be like the, like breeding auto flowers.
[21:40.940 --> 21:44.380]  You can't do like a 10 seed pheno hunt to breed auto flowers.
[21:44.380 --> 21:45.580]  It's a recessive trait.
[21:45.580 --> 21:50.300]  You really need a greenhouse with, with a hunt, you know, 100, 500,000 seeds to be able
[21:50.300 --> 21:55.900]  to find combination of a recessive trait and a bunch of good and a bunch of positive traits
[21:56.780 --> 21:57.980]  coupled with that.
[21:57.980 --> 22:01.260]  So it really depends on your strategy and what you're specifically looking for.
[22:02.300 --> 22:07.180]  F2s are much better for anomalous phenotype than an F1 generation.
[22:07.180 --> 22:11.660]  F1 being the first hybrid between two, you know, distinct parents.
[22:14.780 --> 22:19.180]  If I have, if there's any like confusion on some of that lexicon, you know, peel back
[22:19.180 --> 22:19.580]  the layers.
[22:19.580 --> 22:21.100]  I'm happy to explain the test.
[22:21.100 --> 22:23.820]  That's yield specifically you're referencing with that, right?
[22:23.900 --> 22:29.580]  Maybe not necessarily a flavor profile or a cannabinoid that's specifically yield.
[22:29.580 --> 22:30.300]  It says on there.
[22:32.380 --> 22:33.980]  That's just anomalous in general.
[22:33.980 --> 22:34.220]  Okay.
[22:34.220 --> 22:34.460]  I see.
[22:34.460 --> 22:36.140]  That's just a subset of anomalous.
[22:36.140 --> 22:36.700]  Yep.
[22:36.700 --> 22:36.940]  Yes.
[22:36.940 --> 22:37.180]  Yes.
[22:37.180 --> 22:37.420]  Yes.
[22:38.380 --> 22:43.820]  So one thing I want to, I want to wave a big, big flag to anyone here is that like
[22:43.820 --> 22:46.620]  misconception, you need a lot of seeds to find a good phenotype.
[22:46.620 --> 22:48.940]  People might be like 10,000 seed phenotypes hunt.
[22:48.940 --> 22:50.860]  And I'm like, good luck screening through those.
[22:50.860 --> 22:51.820]  Like, I don't know how you're gonna do that.
[22:52.220 --> 22:58.220]  And you can have a great, like people can find great clones off just one seed pack.
[22:58.220 --> 22:59.900]  It's to happen many, many times.
[22:59.900 --> 23:01.900]  So go hunt seeds.
[23:01.900 --> 23:03.020]  Like you'll find something great.
[23:04.460 --> 23:04.940]  Okay.
[23:04.940 --> 23:06.620]  Phenohunting time that we're getting technical here.
[23:08.380 --> 23:09.900]  Phenohunting timeline.
[23:09.900 --> 23:11.820]  You have three different tracks here.
[23:11.820 --> 23:12.700]  So this is kind of cut off.
[23:12.700 --> 23:13.020]  Sorry.
[23:13.020 --> 23:14.860]  This is the flowering of the seedlings, right?
[23:16.620 --> 23:17.500]  Three different tracks.
[23:17.500 --> 23:20.540]  You have the flowering, which is the plants that you're putting the flower to do the
[23:20.540 --> 23:21.340]  phenotyping.
[23:21.980 --> 23:27.180]  And then you have the backup clones from those flowering plants that you're comparing.
[23:27.820 --> 23:31.660]  And then you have some of this selection, like phases and criteria.
[23:32.300 --> 23:35.580]  So I'm going to push through this a little bit fast because I don't want to get hung up.
[23:35.580 --> 23:39.260]  And there's a lot to go through here, but you know, you're going to germinate the seeds,
[23:39.260 --> 23:40.620]  transplant and veg.
[23:40.620 --> 23:44.060]  At this point, we're going to take, and Travis, you mentioned that earlier, taking clones
[23:44.060 --> 23:44.540]  off those.
[23:45.100 --> 23:48.380]  If you were to take, if you were to flower the clone, then this would kind of split and
[23:48.380 --> 23:50.380]  extend a bit until those clones are ready.
[23:50.460 --> 23:51.020]  To flower.
[23:52.460 --> 23:58.060]  But yeah, at that point, about three weeks in, you're going to be scouting for herms.
[23:58.060 --> 23:59.660]  Many, many seed lines have herms.
[23:59.660 --> 24:03.820]  It's like built into the genetics of the cannabis plant.
[24:03.820 --> 24:08.860]  So if you are pheno hunting, you should always be scouting for herms between weeks three
[24:08.860 --> 24:09.820]  and five primarily.
[24:11.340 --> 24:16.700]  By the time you're getting to week eight, nine of flowering, you now, your backup clones
[24:16.700 --> 24:19.980]  are potentially kind of big plants and managing those is quite difficult.
[24:21.340 --> 24:24.940]  You're going to do your harvest assessment, and then you're going to do your assessment
[24:24.940 --> 24:26.060]  on sensory and COA.
[24:26.860 --> 24:31.100]  This phase, the harvest assessment is oftentimes like overlooked, like, oh crap, we need to
[24:31.100 --> 24:31.420]  harvest.
[24:31.420 --> 24:35.660]  And then you only look at the flower, you might end up like missing a lot of important
[24:35.660 --> 24:36.700]  traits to log there.
[24:37.820 --> 24:39.900]  So that's the general pheno hunting timeline.
[24:42.300 --> 24:43.020]  Ooh, a graph.
[24:43.500 --> 24:48.780]  During this selection timeline, like you said earlier as well, we should be narrowing things
[24:48.780 --> 24:49.580]  down as we go.
[24:50.460 --> 24:55.100]  Like we talked about, holding the clones, if you have a hundred different seeds and
[24:55.100 --> 25:01.100]  you're flowering a hundred plants, holding a hundred clones for the entire duration of
[25:01.100 --> 25:02.540]  that is quite difficult.
[25:02.540 --> 25:04.460]  It's hard to keep them all healthy.
[25:04.460 --> 25:06.060]  It's hard to keep them all labeled properly.
[25:07.180 --> 25:11.820]  Data tracking and all that crap is kind of like, no, we're not going to do that.
[25:12.060 --> 25:19.500]  It seems easy, but when you do this in volume, it's shockingly difficult and a lot of mistakes
[25:19.500 --> 25:21.660]  end up getting made when you do this again and again.
[25:22.460 --> 25:28.060]  So through this, we should be looking at trying to reduce our selections all the way.
[25:28.060 --> 25:31.180]  And notice that we're already reducing this before we even start flowering, right?
[25:31.820 --> 25:37.180]  Don't move into your flowering room or your flowering tent, plants that are blatantly,
[25:37.180 --> 25:41.260]  seedlings that aren't healthy, plants that are blatantly not strong, or they're sick
[25:41.820 --> 25:45.340]  to six inches tall when the other ones are 18 inches, like you're already killing those.
[25:45.900 --> 25:47.420]  So you should always overstock.
[25:47.420 --> 25:51.820]  If you're trying to flower 10 plants, you should germinate 15 or 20 seeds.
[25:51.820 --> 25:53.580]  Like that's just good for you to want to practice.
[25:55.500 --> 26:00.860]  You're going to reduce some when you're like on that harvest day, because you don't like
[26:00.860 --> 26:04.380]  the way that some of them look and they didn't perform that well.
[26:04.380 --> 26:06.460]  And they have some certain trades you want to avoid.
[26:06.460 --> 26:10.380]  You can kill some if you get a COA and you get some other quantitative data.
[26:10.380 --> 26:13.820]  And then finally, when you're smoking on it and you say, this is the one, that's when
[26:13.820 --> 26:16.140]  you determine your winner out of that hunt.
[26:20.610 --> 26:21.110]  Okay.
[26:22.290 --> 26:25.890]  This is like one of my favorite slides in this, because a lot of this pheno hunting,
[26:25.890 --> 26:28.290]  it's focused on that sensory experience.
[26:28.290 --> 26:34.130]  It's focused on, you know, looking at different weed and deciding, oh, I really like this clone.
[26:34.690 --> 26:39.810]  But these are kind of the skills involved that aren't that related to that, that are critical.
[26:39.810 --> 26:41.490]  So number one, data tracking.
[26:42.210 --> 26:46.530]  Gosh, a lot of this is spreadsheet management guys are pretty boring, but having accurate
[26:46.530 --> 26:50.930]  notes that trends that have the same numbers and the same, you know, they look familiar
[26:50.930 --> 26:51.970]  to you at the beginning.
[26:51.970 --> 26:55.570]  And then, you know, four months later, you still know what you're talking about and the
[26:55.570 --> 26:56.130]  numbers add up.
[26:56.130 --> 26:57.170]  It's pretty damn important.
[26:58.450 --> 26:59.250]  Following your plan.
[26:59.890 --> 27:01.490]  Like you have that target.
[27:02.850 --> 27:06.290]  You can obviously, you know, you shouldn't throw away a clone you really like, because
[27:06.290 --> 27:11.410]  you have a certain plan and you're putting in a box, but having a plan is important.
[27:12.210 --> 27:19.250]  And then I also say be brutal, like, oh, but it smells so nice, but it's an impossible
[27:19.250 --> 27:23.650]  plant to trim or it has a test set 15, you know, 12%.
[27:24.050 --> 27:27.170]  It's like there's certain things that are kind of like, dude, it's not a winner.
[27:27.170 --> 27:28.610]  Like, let's grow winners.
[27:28.610 --> 27:31.170]  Be brutal, kill the plants that don't check the boxes.
[27:31.890 --> 27:36.690]  And then lastly, loving your backup clones, keeping those backup clones for four months
[27:36.690 --> 27:37.730]  while they're just sitting there.
[27:38.290 --> 27:40.450]  You know, focusing on those is really important.
[27:40.450 --> 27:45.250]  That's the biggest mistake people make is letting those kind of like letting those,
[27:45.810 --> 27:47.250]  the health decline in those.
[27:47.250 --> 27:52.690]  And I'll tell you right now, it's like Murphy's law that you find the one, you go back to
[27:52.690 --> 27:55.570]  the nursery and that's the only plant that's dead.
[27:55.570 --> 27:59.330]  And you're like, no, it happens so more often than you think.
[27:59.970 --> 28:05.010]  I feel like a way that costs a little bit of work, but as long as you do the chore, to
[28:05.090 --> 28:08.130]  me, it helps ensure the health of the next generation.
[28:08.130 --> 28:11.650]  So let's say you kept the seedling or you have your backup cutting.
[28:11.650 --> 28:16.130]  Once it starts out growing its container or becoming a nuisance with its health or its
[28:16.130 --> 28:21.570]  or its space limitations, you kind of just take another cutting, which is another process,
[28:21.570 --> 28:25.730]  but you just throw that into a one or a three gallon with some fresh soil or something with
[28:25.730 --> 28:30.930]  nutrition that by the time you have enough data, you'll have a happy plant to rip more
[28:30.930 --> 28:31.650]  cuts off of.
[28:31.730 --> 28:35.170]  And you can even just gift away the other one or, you know, just kill it.
[28:35.170 --> 28:39.570]  And that strategy has worked for me before, because I totally agree keeping those backups
[28:39.570 --> 28:43.730]  is important and tedious and loses attention sometimes.
[28:43.730 --> 28:47.570]  So I feel like just ripping a new cut, letting it root up and just throwing it in enough
[28:47.570 --> 28:49.170]  root room where you just give it water.
[28:49.170 --> 28:50.210]  You don't have to trip on it.
[28:50.210 --> 28:51.250]  And it's like, it's good.
[28:51.970 --> 28:52.530]  Totally.
[28:52.530 --> 28:57.650]  And, and you know what, if that can be a condensed number, because things aren't looking that
[28:57.650 --> 29:00.770]  great and you're halfway through this, or you're three quarters away through this process,
[29:00.850 --> 29:05.170]  three quarters away through this process and you're, and you're at 25 promising phenotypes,
[29:05.730 --> 29:11.090]  giving your love and attention to 25 winners is a lot better than trying to keep a hundred
[29:11.090 --> 29:13.250]  sort of happy and then having some die.
[29:13.250 --> 29:16.770]  And I guarantee the one that die will be the one that you love.
[29:16.770 --> 29:23.090]  So I 100% agree recloning it, you know, keeping those, but how you keep the clone mothers
[29:23.090 --> 29:24.770]  is very dependent on your setup.
[29:24.770 --> 29:27.570]  If you're a tent grower, if you're a commercial grower, it's going to be completely different.
[29:27.890 --> 29:28.390]  Yeah.
[29:29.330 --> 29:29.830]  Okay.
[29:30.290 --> 29:31.490]  Ooh, bought me.
[29:33.090 --> 29:33.650]  Okay.
[29:33.650 --> 29:35.570]  So seed germination.
[29:37.650 --> 29:42.370]  There are two different, there are two different types of germinations that happen in the,
[29:44.050 --> 29:50.210]  in the seed world, in the plant kingdom, epigelial germinations and hypogeal germinations.
[29:50.210 --> 29:56.850]  The difference is that the seed coat, like carry, it gets carried up with the extending
[29:57.730 --> 30:04.050]  hypocoddle and new foliage and the cotyledon and like gets elongated out of the substrate.
[30:04.050 --> 30:08.770]  And then hypogeal, the seed coat stays in the substrate and then the shoot goes up.
[30:11.010 --> 30:16.210]  Cannabis is an epigelial and because it has epigelial, epigelial seeds have specific
[30:16.210 --> 30:18.370]  problems that you can, that you want to avoid.
[30:21.410 --> 30:26.690]  So seed germination, I'm not going to get too much into the, the really, I actually have
[30:26.690 --> 30:27.650]  another protocol on this.
[30:27.650 --> 30:32.850]  You can download off our website, but there's a couple of, there's a bunch of different
[30:32.850 --> 30:33.890]  techniques for this.
[30:33.890 --> 30:36.450]  I like to do some pre-rinse of the seeds.
[30:37.570 --> 30:41.570]  And I want to shout out to Alan of Root Down Genetics for helping me develop this protocol,
[30:41.570 --> 30:50.210]  the pre-rinse with, with hypochlor, excuse me, H2O2 being the primary agent for that
[30:50.210 --> 30:50.710]  rinsing.
[30:51.250 --> 30:54.770]  But a lot of people put seeds in paper towels to germinate.
[30:55.490 --> 30:59.730]  When you're doing that, it's really easy to like check on each individual seed, but
[30:59.730 --> 31:01.410]  it's a little more annoying to transplant.
[31:02.210 --> 31:06.530]  This is good technique if you have like, if you have like a seed pack or like a couple
[31:06.530 --> 31:07.090]  seed packs.
[31:08.050 --> 31:11.410]  If you want to, if you're running a lot of seeds, like you're not going to do this
[31:11.410 --> 31:11.890]  technique.
[31:11.890 --> 31:16.610]  So anyway, there's a bunch of different ways to do seed germination.
[31:16.610 --> 31:20.450]  I'm going to kind of plow through this and there's much more we can talk about this.
[31:20.770 --> 31:25.730]  Pre-rinsing, again, you can download the protocol on the website and we'll put a link to that
[31:25.730 --> 31:27.090]  later, put that in the chat.
[31:28.610 --> 31:28.850]  Okay.
[31:28.850 --> 31:34.210]  Most common problems with germinating seeds, damping off etiolation and germinating upside
[31:34.210 --> 31:34.450]  down.
[31:35.250 --> 31:42.050]  So damping off is, is kind of a catch all name for a like rotting out disease that happens
[31:42.050 --> 31:43.410]  for seedlings and small plants.
[31:43.970 --> 31:49.250]  And it's typically that like a long, elongated place where it interfaces between the soil
[31:49.250 --> 31:56.050]  and the, and the, you know, the substrate and the beginning of the, the crown is really
[31:56.050 --> 31:57.410]  crown formation.
[31:57.410 --> 32:01.970]  So having clean seeds really, really helps this and not over watering really, really
[32:01.970 --> 32:05.170]  helps us to etiolation is the other one.
[32:05.170 --> 32:08.850]  Etiolation is a fancy word for that, like excessive elongation.
[32:08.850 --> 32:14.690]  The plant has when the light intensity, that's kind of cut off excessive elongation of the
[32:14.690 --> 32:16.370]  plant when the light intensity isn't high.
[32:16.530 --> 32:21.410]  You kind of want to run your seedlings once they have a couple true leaves with like high,
[32:21.410 --> 32:25.810]  pretty highlight, pretty common problem to run them under like baby them under low light.
[32:25.810 --> 32:29.650]  And then they get like super stringy and they become impossible to manage.
[32:30.770 --> 32:36.530]  There is a trick that you can put like twist ties, or you can use collar tags to kind of
[32:36.530 --> 32:37.410]  support them.
[32:37.410 --> 32:40.530]  Can show you how to do that, but there's some tricks to that, but really common.
[32:40.530 --> 32:46.130]  And then germinating upside down is one that often happens in like rock wool or, uh, uh,
[32:46.930 --> 32:53.250]  or root riot, like plugs where the actual, you know, that hypogeal remember, sorry, epigeal
[32:53.250 --> 32:58.450]  germination, that elongation of the cotyledon kind of goes down into it and gets, since
[32:58.450 --> 33:01.650]  the substrate isn't like loose, it gets stuck.
[33:02.370 --> 33:11.490]  So that's why like, uh, aggregate substrates like, uh, um, vermiculite or like soil are
[33:11.490 --> 33:17.650]  best for seedlings and, you know, and the stabilized substrate like rock wool or, uh,
[33:17.650 --> 33:23.650]  root riot plugs are best for clones, but I would stick to aggregate, uh, aggregate soils
[33:23.650 --> 33:24.690]  when using seeds.
[33:27.250 --> 33:27.650]  Okay.
[33:27.650 --> 33:31.410]  So you, uh, you, you touched, touched on this a little bit like cloning for pheno hunting.
[33:31.410 --> 33:38.770]  Um, and there's a couple, I'm presenting four different techniques for cloning and, uh,
[33:38.770 --> 33:40.290]  there is a lot of technique to this.
[33:40.290 --> 33:46.370]  So first thing, taking the clone as the top of the seedling, meaning the apical bud of
[33:46.370 --> 33:46.930]  the seedling.
[33:46.930 --> 33:50.690]  I don't know if you can switch the screen, but I'm going to, I'm going to use this, you
[33:50.690 --> 33:56.450]  know, like if the plant is a, uh, is, is elongated like that, that would be like cutting that
[33:56.450 --> 34:01.330]  top off and then cloning that that's going to give the plants a really weird expression.
[34:01.330 --> 34:02.130]  Just don't do this.
[34:02.690 --> 34:07.170]  What you want to do instead is let the plant elongate and then take one of the lower buds
[34:07.170 --> 34:08.770]  as your, as your clone.
[34:08.850 --> 34:13.570]  If you are flowering that seedling, if you're doing what Travis mentioned there and you're
[34:13.570 --> 34:15.810]  flowering the clones, then that is a totally suitable technique.
[34:15.810 --> 34:18.210]  And you can take that top and then flower that one.
[34:18.210 --> 34:23.170]  That's very interesting to me because usually I won't top the seedling until I'm ready to
[34:23.170 --> 34:24.290]  take cuttings off it.
[34:24.850 --> 34:28.770]  I'll take, you know, the top couple, you know, six nodes, like you said, and you can get
[34:28.770 --> 34:30.290]  two cuttings out of it.
[34:30.290 --> 34:35.410]  I'll usually keep the top, top one as the backup and then flower the second level or
[34:35.410 --> 34:38.210]  the like, you know, second shelf, as I call it, kind of.
[34:38.210 --> 34:40.770]  So that works fine if you're, if you're doing that.
[34:40.770 --> 34:47.570]  What I'm, what I'm specifically saying don't do is flower that, a topped seedling, a seedling
[34:47.570 --> 34:48.850]  that has a top cut off it.
[34:50.290 --> 34:52.050]  That is going to behave super weird.
[34:52.050 --> 34:55.410]  Like that usually grows because the parallel nose is going to grow two mains.
[34:55.410 --> 34:58.690]  And it's like, you're really growing that plant like an oddball.
[34:58.690 --> 35:00.370]  I see what you're saying.
[35:00.370 --> 35:02.930]  Right when you said don't do this, I was like, that's how I do this.
[35:04.210 --> 35:06.210]  If you're flowering those clones, then that's perfect.
[35:07.170 --> 35:13.490]  So, but my preferred, my preferred technique is to take clones when you're bottom pruning,
[35:13.490 --> 35:15.410]  right when you're ready to go to flower.
[35:15.410 --> 35:16.690]  So the plants are like teens.
[35:17.250 --> 35:21.730]  And what you do is that you don't bother cutting clones off plants that you don't like for
[35:21.730 --> 35:22.610]  flower.
[35:22.610 --> 35:22.850]  Right.
[35:24.530 --> 35:27.090]  Here's another, here's another part of this.
[35:27.090 --> 35:29.890]  You start to number them, the pheno numbers.
[35:29.890 --> 35:35.410]  I'm fed a lot of like casual, you know, casual cannabis consumers don't know why there's
[35:35.410 --> 35:40.050]  numbers there like GG4, like, you know, Gorilla Glue 4.
[35:40.050 --> 35:41.330]  Why is that 4 there?
[35:41.330 --> 35:43.410]  It's because that's the phenotype number.
[35:43.410 --> 35:48.050]  When we move the plants in, you're going to, if you have 25 seedlings or 25 plants that
[35:48.050 --> 35:51.970]  you're flowering, you number them 1 through 25.
[35:51.970 --> 35:56.930]  When you take the clone off them, that's now clone that corresponds to plant number one.
[35:56.930 --> 35:57.810]  So that's number one.
[35:58.450 --> 36:02.850]  So when we do this selection, I showed you mellows, mellows 7, 8, and 14.
[36:03.650 --> 36:08.370]  Those were different pheno numbers in the room of like a 25 seed hunt.
[36:08.370 --> 36:12.450]  So anyway, that to me is the lowest labor and highest success rate.
[36:12.450 --> 36:15.730]  And, and then those lowers usually make great clones.
[36:15.730 --> 36:17.090]  So that is a great technique.
[36:17.730 --> 36:18.450]  Other techniques.
[36:19.650 --> 36:20.930]  This is for big hunts.
[36:20.930 --> 36:26.290]  If you clone from promising phenotypes in week four to six of flowering, if you're doing,
[36:26.290 --> 36:29.730]  it's very hard to keep clones of a thousand seed pheno hunt.
[36:30.370 --> 36:36.050]  If you can go into a field at week four to six, you have a pretty high likelihood of
[36:36.050 --> 36:42.050]  being able to gather a clone and revege it.
[36:42.050 --> 36:43.490]  Reveging takes forever.
[36:43.490 --> 36:46.690]  And it's like not, this isn't a great technique and it might fail.
[36:47.330 --> 36:50.290]  The failure is much, fail rate is much higher in this.
[36:50.930 --> 36:55.650]  But it's still a pretty good technique if you're talking about doing a low labor
[36:56.930 --> 36:58.370]  pheno hunt of a lot of seeds.
[36:58.930 --> 37:03.970]  And then lastly, we have, if you have tens of thousands, if you have a field of 10,000
[37:03.970 --> 37:08.370]  phenotypes, hitting, trying to get the clone later in flower, when you really know, wow,
[37:08.370 --> 37:09.650]  this is amazing.
[37:09.650 --> 37:15.330]  But man, flowering a plant that late, taking a clone and having it be successful that late,
[37:15.330 --> 37:16.370]  super, super difficult.
[37:17.490 --> 37:24.210]  But you can see that we're juggling essentially labor and effort, depending on how many seeds
[37:24.210 --> 37:24.690]  we're growing.
[37:26.290 --> 37:27.730]  Travis, does that make sense?
[37:27.810 --> 37:30.450]  Do you want to embellish on that or is that too much here?
[37:30.450 --> 37:31.410]  Absolutely.
[37:31.410 --> 37:38.130]  And I think for the first time ever next spring, I might utilize the hoops to do more of a
[37:38.130 --> 37:40.850]  number three approach, which would be my first time.
[37:40.850 --> 37:45.490]  That was actually going to be one of my specific questions at the end if you didn't touch on
[37:45.490 --> 37:45.730]  it.
[37:45.730 --> 37:51.010]  But that piques my interest because, you know, you got to, I feel like you got to go through
[37:51.010 --> 37:55.010]  at least a hundred if it's something totally unknown, or at least I want to, I want to
[37:55.010 --> 37:56.610]  look at a big population.
[37:57.410 --> 38:00.370]  And I like that clear, concise, laid out approach.
[38:00.370 --> 38:01.250]  It makes sense.
[38:01.250 --> 38:02.530]  And all those things are true.
[38:02.530 --> 38:06.450]  Taking the cuts then is a little easier, but it's still lame and they don't always root
[38:06.450 --> 38:07.730]  or veg back out.
[38:07.730 --> 38:10.770]  And revegging plants is kind of just lame.
[38:10.770 --> 38:14.290]  And you got to do it though, you know?
[38:14.290 --> 38:15.970]  It makes sense, definitely.
[38:15.970 --> 38:21.090]  A little trick to this as well that I mentioned here is dig as deep in the canopy as possible
[38:21.090 --> 38:25.010]  because oftentimes the apexes, which are typically kind of the best clones,
[38:26.610 --> 38:29.090]  are also the most mature and finished flowers.
[38:29.090 --> 38:32.770]  But if you have a big plant, especially outdoors, if you dig really, if you kind of like get
[38:32.770 --> 38:36.930]  on your hands and knees and like look under, you know, like where the presence of the Christmas
[38:36.930 --> 38:37.970]  trees are hiding, you know what I mean?
[38:37.970 --> 38:42.050]  Like getting under that, that's usually really good clone material because they're, they're
[38:42.050 --> 38:46.930]  a little bit like more veg and they may only have like one or two little buds on them.
[38:46.930 --> 38:47.970]  Yeah, that's good insight.
[38:47.970 --> 38:49.250]  That makes a lot of sense.
[38:49.250 --> 38:49.730]  Yeah.
[38:49.730 --> 38:54.050]  And I'd rather take 10 of those than take one of everything in a field of 10,000.
[38:54.050 --> 38:54.690]  It's just crazy.
[38:55.650 --> 38:59.650]  I know that Humboldt Seed Co. uses that and I think they've done that before for large
[38:59.650 --> 39:01.250]  pheno-hunts and it works pretty good for them.
[39:03.810 --> 39:04.530]  Cool.
[39:04.530 --> 39:06.050]  Considerations in flowering seeds.
[39:06.050 --> 39:06.450]  Okay.
[39:06.450 --> 39:07.730]  You flower clones all the time.
[39:07.730 --> 39:08.690]  You're an expert grower.
[39:09.410 --> 39:10.210]  What about seeds?
[39:11.490 --> 39:16.850]  There's a couple things that impact this and one thing I will say, you know, hot take on
[39:16.850 --> 39:20.850]  the comments here will be use cocoa.
[39:20.850 --> 39:22.050]  Don't use rockwool.
[39:22.050 --> 39:22.770]  I love rockwool.
[39:22.770 --> 39:23.810]  I love growdan.
[39:24.130 --> 39:25.090]  I love all those guys.
[39:25.090 --> 39:25.890]  They're great.
[39:25.890 --> 39:30.770]  But cocoa has a much lower wilt point for field capacity.
[39:31.410 --> 39:35.330]  So there's actually different substrates have like a percent water capacity that then it
[39:35.330 --> 39:35.810]  wilts at.
[39:36.370 --> 39:42.130]  So cocoa can get to 15% water capacity and not wilt, whereas rockwool wilts at around
[39:42.130 --> 39:42.370]  20%.
[39:43.410 --> 39:44.130]  What does that mean?
[39:44.770 --> 39:49.810]  If you have a really fast growing plant in the same irrigation and the same substrate
[39:49.810 --> 39:54.690]  in the same room next to a slow growing plant and you're watering them the same, the fast
[39:54.690 --> 39:57.410]  growing plant is going to get drier much faster.
[39:57.970 --> 40:03.170]  So what that does is cocoa allows you to be a little bit more like forgiving for different
[40:03.170 --> 40:04.130]  plant sizes.
[40:04.130 --> 40:09.330]  That might be one might be really wet because you watered it yesterday and grow slow.
[40:09.330 --> 40:10.690]  The other one grows really fast.
[40:10.690 --> 40:12.130]  It's really dry.
[40:12.130 --> 40:14.690]  Those plants aren't one isn't going to die.
[40:14.690 --> 40:16.370]  So that's a little bit of a tidbit there.
[40:16.930 --> 40:22.930]  You also want to your bottom pruning or pruning technique might be you don't really care about
[40:22.930 --> 40:24.290]  yields with a phenol hunt.
[40:24.290 --> 40:31.650]  So you can stack more plants in and bottom prune them higher than a normal plant.
[40:31.650 --> 40:36.130]  So that would kind of be my recommendation to see because you only need to see one apex.
[40:36.130 --> 40:41.650]  Really, you need to see one bud and bud structure, but you don't need like a whole giant plant
[40:41.650 --> 40:42.850]  to know if it's a good phenol.
[40:44.210 --> 40:45.330]  I firmly agree with that.
[40:45.330 --> 40:47.330]  It looks like those are like two gallons or so.
[40:47.330 --> 40:48.450]  They're in one gallons.
[40:49.170 --> 40:52.130]  Yeah, these are one gallon pots and look how high they're pruned.
[40:52.130 --> 40:55.010]  So this is actually from one of the same thing in my phenol hunt.
[40:55.010 --> 40:59.490]  I like to like let a clone root out pretty much a little bit in there, maybe a couple
[40:59.490 --> 41:01.330]  days and then just flip them all right away.
[41:01.330 --> 41:03.570]  I firmly agree with that approach.
[41:03.570 --> 41:07.730]  The other thing that this allows you to do is if you have any herms on those little bottom
[41:07.730 --> 41:10.450]  prune things, you don't have to be on your hands and knees to see them.
[41:10.450 --> 41:13.490]  You look through at essentially eye level or chest level to see the herms.
[41:14.210 --> 41:17.330]  I feel like with the smaller plant, you can thoroughly look at each one.
[41:17.330 --> 41:21.170]  You can almost look at every intersection and kind of just get in a broad.
[41:21.170 --> 41:25.410]  If you have a big, humongous test plant, it's hard to really get in there, intimately check
[41:25.410 --> 41:25.970]  everything out.
[41:25.970 --> 41:28.370]  With that, you can really snoop around.
[41:28.930 --> 41:29.490]  Absolutely.
[41:31.570 --> 41:34.690]  And things like automated irrigation can be a little difficult too if you have a bunch
[41:34.690 --> 41:35.730]  of different size plants.
[41:36.450 --> 41:36.950]  Okay.
[41:38.050 --> 41:44.050]  This is a reversed, this is STS on a reversed black rose plant.
[41:45.570 --> 41:47.410]  We just harvested some seeds from.
[41:47.410 --> 41:50.530]  So this is a good example of a feminized plant.
[41:50.530 --> 41:55.490]  But okay, quick crash course on regular versus feminized seeds because your hunting strategy
[41:55.490 --> 41:58.210]  is going to be pretty significantly different with these different types.
[41:58.210 --> 42:01.330]  Is, you know, regular come from a male plant.
[42:02.210 --> 42:04.690]  Regular seeds come from a male plant pollinated in female plant.
[42:04.690 --> 42:10.450]  Feminized come from reversing a female and using a chemical agent and then creating pollen
[42:10.450 --> 42:11.730]  from that to make a cross.
[42:13.490 --> 42:19.810]  Compound genetics, we do essentially all reversed feminized seeds where we are obsessed with
[42:19.810 --> 42:20.290]  clones.
[42:21.090 --> 42:28.050]  And what we don't want is to make a seed line from a plant that we don't know how it, what
[42:28.050 --> 42:31.410]  exact traits it has in flower as a female.
[42:31.410 --> 42:36.530]  So we really like to reverse females because we know exactly what traits we're passing
[42:36.530 --> 42:39.250]  on the next generation.
[42:40.930 --> 42:46.850]  So if you do run regular seeds, I highly recommend using sex testing before you flower so you
[42:46.850 --> 42:50.210]  can avoid the males, unless you want males and you want to start breeding.
[42:50.850 --> 42:55.010]  But I definitely recommend some great providers that such as Leafworks, Medicinal Genomics
[42:55.010 --> 42:56.290]  and MyFloraDNA.
[42:56.290 --> 42:59.970]  They all have great, you know, Eleanor at Leafworks is awesome.
[42:59.970 --> 43:01.410]  And we love the team there.
[43:01.410 --> 43:03.090]  So they do great work.
[43:05.570 --> 43:08.690]  Okay, again, data collection.
[43:08.690 --> 43:12.290]  This is the boring part of this, but it's still important for people.
[43:12.290 --> 43:13.570]  Use caller tags.
[43:13.570 --> 43:18.450]  One of the most common things, especially with the backup clones and the flowering plants
[43:18.450 --> 43:23.250]  is you water the plant and the tag either gets buried in the substrate or it gets flooded
[43:23.250 --> 43:29.330]  out of the pot and it's on the table somewhere and you go, fuck, and you lose the corresponding
[43:29.330 --> 43:30.050]  clone.
[43:30.050 --> 43:31.890]  Use caller tags and you will never have this problem.
[43:33.490 --> 43:38.530]  Also, you know, numbering and coding, creating a, you know, really trying to be thoughtful
[43:38.530 --> 43:39.650]  about that is very important.
[43:40.930 --> 43:45.490]  And then we like to make a map of the room of the different phenotypes.
[43:45.490 --> 43:50.050]  So like, if you have just have a tent, you can like look at a piece of paper and remember
[43:50.050 --> 43:52.770]  which phenos are where in the room so you can like check on them.
[43:54.530 --> 43:55.490]  Okay, I already have that.
[43:55.570 --> 43:56.850]  Yeah, selection phases.
[43:56.850 --> 43:58.770]  We have five primary selection phases.
[43:59.810 --> 44:04.690]  The veg phase where we decide, you know, veg phase, mid flower to look for those herms
[44:04.690 --> 44:08.850]  because we're going to be killing, herms, we just kill it off and kill the clone, right?
[44:08.850 --> 44:12.930]  Upon harvest, post processing, and then COA and sensory where we're actually smoking it
[44:12.930 --> 44:14.210]  and getting data.
[44:17.570 --> 44:22.290]  You know, key, you know, we're really digging, when we talk about the corresponding data
[44:22.370 --> 44:27.410]  metric for each one of these phases, veg, veg speed, like overall health is going to
[44:27.410 --> 44:27.970]  be key for that.
[44:28.850 --> 44:32.850]  The, the herm is going to be huge for the mid flowers, we'll stretch data.
[44:33.810 --> 44:38.370]  And then three is just going to be, is going to be a ton of data on that.
[44:38.370 --> 44:44.450]  That's going to be so much of the plant's morphology, bud structure, color, fade, trichome,
[44:45.010 --> 44:48.770]  overall health, yield, so much of that from what we see in the room.
[44:48.850 --> 44:53.250]  Post processing, things like trim difficulty and yields.
[44:53.250 --> 44:56.450]  However, yields can be quite difficult in this pheno hunting phase, right?
[44:56.450 --> 44:59.170]  We just talked about how you're going to bottom prune it weird and you're going to do this
[44:59.170 --> 45:06.050]  and that, like yield data is pretty damn, like anecdotal and irrelevant for the pheno
[45:06.050 --> 45:06.610]  hunting phase.
[45:06.610 --> 45:09.570]  It's much more relevant when you're running the clones a second time.
[45:11.250 --> 45:17.330]  So to me, I get my yield data estimates at this phase at the harvest stage, not at post
[45:17.330 --> 45:17.890]  processing.
[45:19.490 --> 45:24.130]  By judging how strong the plant is, how big the plant is, how big the buds are, how many
[45:24.130 --> 45:25.890]  buds there are, it's bud structure.
[45:25.890 --> 45:29.570]  And I guess just over the years as you get an eye for like what a big yielding plant
[45:29.570 --> 45:30.450]  looks like, so to speak.
[45:33.650 --> 45:39.730]  This is an example of what like at node labs we do at each of these, we have like hundreds
[45:39.730 --> 45:44.930]  of these, I think it's like 140 different things we'd record during these, but you can
[45:44.930 --> 45:49.490]  see that we have some like, we try to have some like objective measurements for each
[45:49.490 --> 45:50.610]  one of these phases, right?
[45:51.250 --> 45:56.850]  Resistance to environmental stress is not, is something that like opportunistic.
[45:56.850 --> 46:00.930]  Like if something happens that causes stress, we're going to say, well, that one didn't
[46:00.930 --> 46:01.730]  even react to it.
[46:01.730 --> 46:02.370]  Wow.
[46:02.370 --> 46:07.250]  If something, if we have a disease or an insect outbreak and then one of the plants like just
[46:07.250 --> 46:09.810]  doesn't care about it when the other one got hit hard.
[46:09.810 --> 46:10.930]  Okay, here we go.
[46:11.490 --> 46:19.010]  But many of these are, you know, we try to go with these objective, like numbered measurements
[46:20.130 --> 46:22.850]  and record each one of these piece of agronomic data.
[46:24.850 --> 46:29.650]  I got this idea to made this protocol from an avocado breeding textbook.
[46:31.010 --> 46:32.290]  Sorry, I'm a huge plant nerd.
[46:32.290 --> 46:33.810]  So that's what I do in my free time.
[46:35.410 --> 46:36.850]  Where they graded everything on a one to five.
[46:36.850 --> 46:39.090]  I was wondering how you dialed all this in.
[46:39.090 --> 46:40.210]  You were reading my mind.
[46:40.210 --> 46:41.890]  I was like, I was really dialed in.
[46:41.890 --> 46:44.050]  He's like, all the thoughts compiled.
[46:44.050 --> 46:44.930]  This is so cool.
[46:45.570 --> 46:46.370]  I appreciate it.
[46:47.410 --> 46:51.490]  But yeah, I've read a lot of, I mean, there's a lot of really interesting literature on
[46:51.490 --> 46:52.690]  breeding other plants.
[46:52.690 --> 46:58.610]  And a lot of those, a lot of that, it's really, most of it's extremely dense and a lot of
[46:58.610 --> 47:01.410]  it doesn't apply to cannabis, but the stuff that does is really instructional.
[47:01.410 --> 47:02.450]  I think it's really interesting.
[47:02.450 --> 47:04.290]  And that's like what the company's doing.
[47:04.290 --> 47:05.490]  No labs and compound genetics.
[47:05.490 --> 47:11.810]  We're trying to bring like high end science and technology as well as the art and the
[47:11.810 --> 47:15.810]  love of the plant and just like actually smoking weed and grading it and being like, we love
[47:15.810 --> 47:16.370]  this product.
[47:17.090 --> 47:19.730]  We want to combine those two things, the art and the science.
[47:20.690 --> 47:21.650]  That's what we do.
[47:21.650 --> 47:27.970]  But anyway, with this data collection, this is getting in the weeds of like nerdy stuff,
[47:27.970 --> 47:34.930]  but we have this one through five grading thing, but it can't always be quantitative.
[47:34.930 --> 47:35.970]  What do I mean by that?
[47:35.970 --> 47:36.690]  Okay.
[47:36.690 --> 47:38.290]  Difficulty of trimming.
[47:38.290 --> 47:41.250]  Like we just want no ones we want very easy.
[47:41.250 --> 47:41.890]  Right.
[47:41.890 --> 47:43.010]  So it's like a golf score.
[47:43.010 --> 47:44.370]  Like the lower the score, the better.
[47:44.370 --> 47:44.690]  Great.
[47:44.690 --> 47:45.090]  Right.
[47:45.090 --> 47:46.930]  Everything that's one's all around.
[47:46.930 --> 47:48.370]  Like what a great plant.
[47:48.370 --> 47:52.530]  But there's other stuff that when you're measuring it, you can't really put a number like stretch.
[47:53.730 --> 47:55.410]  It's not really good to have no stretch.
[47:55.410 --> 47:57.650]  It's also not good to have extreme stretch.
[47:57.650 --> 48:01.010]  So a lot of these are end up being like threes are the best.
[48:01.570 --> 48:05.410]  So we're still struggling with this to say, like, I can't really give it like a score
[48:05.410 --> 48:05.730]  numbers.
[48:05.730 --> 48:06.290]  Oh my God.
[48:06.290 --> 48:10.450]  Like it's a hundred out of a hundred because there's a lot of these things that are kind
[48:10.450 --> 48:12.130]  of more like, well, it just wants to be average.
[48:12.130 --> 48:13.330]  It wants to be manageable.
[48:13.330 --> 48:14.450]  So we're still struggling with that.
[48:14.450 --> 48:15.570]  It's interesting.
[48:15.570 --> 48:18.850]  I feel like that could be facility specific as well, which is interesting.
[48:18.850 --> 48:24.210]  If someone has limited veg space, like they may want a four, maybe not necessarily a five,
[48:24.210 --> 48:25.970]  but maybe a four would fit great there.
[48:26.610 --> 48:29.970]  Someone, when they were doing their planning, they ended up with too much veg space.
[48:29.970 --> 48:34.450]  You could do like some Urkels or Bubbas or whatever stuff that just like crawls along.
[48:34.450 --> 48:39.170]  And I feel like there's a, there could be a strategy if everything else is that important
[48:39.170 --> 48:41.570]  or where it's worth keeping in the right facility.
[48:41.570 --> 48:42.210]  Absolutely.
[48:42.210 --> 48:48.130]  So, I mean, that's what we do at Node Labs is go is, is we we're doing an overall grade
[48:48.130 --> 48:52.770]  to be like, this is great weed and it's commercially viable and it smells great.
[48:52.770 --> 48:55.410]  And it, and it gets, it makes you feel great and all those things.
[48:56.290 --> 49:01.890]  But also we record these other things that are not necessarily like quantitative or like
[49:01.890 --> 49:04.770]  good or bad, but just say like, well, what works for, what do you like to grow?
[49:05.330 --> 49:06.210]  You like stretchy stuff?
[49:06.210 --> 49:06.370]  Okay.
[49:06.370 --> 49:07.170]  We have stretchy stuff.
[49:07.170 --> 49:09.730]  If you don't like, you're better with no stretch.
[49:09.730 --> 49:10.610]  Oh, we have that too.
[49:10.610 --> 49:12.370]  But recording it's important, you know?
[49:13.330 --> 49:17.490]  And that's kind of where we're trying to really set ourselves apart is provide people elite
[49:17.490 --> 49:21.170]  clones, but also have like all the data and how to grow it.
[49:21.810 --> 49:23.570]  That's really where I, my passion lies.
[49:25.730 --> 49:27.250]  Well, advanced pheno hunting techniques.
[49:27.250 --> 49:29.330]  Oh, we do have time to plow through this.
[49:29.330 --> 49:31.730]  So this should be exciting.
[49:33.170 --> 49:34.610]  When's your cutoff at an hour?
[49:34.610 --> 49:35.970]  We have about 10 minutes left or so.
[49:37.490 --> 49:38.130]  Peter?
[49:38.130 --> 49:39.170]  Did you have a cutoff time?
[49:40.370 --> 49:41.490]  Oh, I don't have a cutoff.
[49:41.490 --> 49:43.010]  I've just figured it's an hour.
[49:43.810 --> 49:45.090]  I'm so used to Zoom meetings.
[49:45.090 --> 49:46.770]  I figure it's an hour and then we have to wrap up.
[49:47.410 --> 49:51.490]  We can keep going, especially if you're interested in the conversation, which I certainly am.
[49:51.490 --> 49:53.890]  And I'm sure we'll get some intriguing questions.
[49:53.890 --> 49:54.450]  Oh, let's do it.
[49:55.090 --> 49:56.690]  Yeah, let's get through this.
[49:56.690 --> 49:59.010]  And I'd love to turn it into more of like a discussion afterwards.
[49:59.010 --> 49:59.570]  That sounds great.
[49:59.570 --> 50:00.210]  Awesome.
[50:00.210 --> 50:00.370]  Yeah.
[50:00.370 --> 50:02.930]  Sorry, I'm just like plowing through this, but...
[50:02.930 --> 50:03.890]  No, I'm digging it.
[50:03.890 --> 50:04.530]  Yeah, it's great.
[50:04.530 --> 50:05.030]  Cool.
[50:05.730 --> 50:06.050]  All right.
[50:06.050 --> 50:07.890]  So advanced pheno hunting techniques.
[50:08.930 --> 50:14.530]  Node Labs, you know, we're primarily a, you know, we're breeding and pheno hunting testing
[50:14.530 --> 50:16.770]  facility, but we're also a tissue culture laboratory.
[50:17.330 --> 50:22.850]  And we've developed a process called in vitro pheno hunting, where we germinate the seeds
[50:22.850 --> 50:26.770]  at the laboratory in vitro and they're sterile upon arrival.
[50:28.290 --> 50:33.490]  Our darling new seed line clone, which we really think is like the best of the best,
[50:33.490 --> 50:38.930]  we're in love with, Gastropop, Gastropop number five specifically, was born at the lab.
[50:39.650 --> 50:44.130]  And what we're doing is essentially germinating the seeds in the sterile environment,
[50:44.930 --> 50:48.210]  taking a clone and then doing exactly the technique you talked about,
[50:48.210 --> 50:51.970]  Travis, where we're taking the clone and then we're flowering the clone.
[50:51.970 --> 50:56.290]  And then that little seedling, it still lives at the lab to this day.
[50:56.290 --> 51:02.130]  It's never, ever been exposed to a single fungal or bacteria spore in its entire life.
[51:02.850 --> 51:07.170]  And we developed this technique when Hoplite and Viroid was like
[51:08.290 --> 51:09.250]  super scary.
[51:09.250 --> 51:11.970]  And a lot of people were trying to figure out how the heck to manage it.
[51:11.970 --> 51:15.730]  We like, we consider ourselves like best in the universe at managing it.
[51:15.730 --> 51:18.450]  And we haven't had a positive test in like a year or something like that.
[51:19.170 --> 51:23.490]  But we're excellent at managing it.
[51:23.490 --> 51:27.250]  But at this point, we were like, oh my God, we have to, these elite genetics,
[51:27.250 --> 51:28.050]  we have to protect them.
[51:28.610 --> 51:32.930]  And what this also does is expedite the tissue culture process by a lot.
[51:32.930 --> 51:33.970]  So we can get this done.
[51:33.970 --> 51:35.170]  I think it's like 10 months.
[51:35.810 --> 51:43.810]  We can get, we can grow it at the laboratory, hunt it, test it again in a flowering run,
[51:44.370 --> 51:49.730]  and gather all the data and have it be available at the lab to a commercial client,
[51:49.730 --> 51:53.250]  which is kind of like unprecedented as far as timeline goes.
[51:54.690 --> 51:55.970]  Yeah, that's kind of amazing.
[51:55.970 --> 51:56.470]  That's cool.
[51:57.090 --> 51:57.330]  Yes.
[51:57.330 --> 52:02.770]  So, so it's, yeah, for again, the Uber, like commercial propagation nerds,
[52:02.770 --> 52:05.170]  this is kind of the top of nerd mountain for that.
[52:05.170 --> 52:10.050]  But we're very excited about this process.
[52:10.050 --> 52:12.850]  We did 12 different hunts of this at the lab this year.
[52:14.050 --> 52:15.890]  And we're really excited about like expanding this program.
[52:15.890 --> 52:16.450]  It's really cool.
[52:18.530 --> 52:19.410]  Okay.
[52:19.410 --> 52:20.930]  Some cool genetic stuff.
[52:24.610 --> 52:31.010]  So many seeds, 95% of the seeds you see out there these days are like F1 generations,
[52:31.010 --> 52:36.210]  you know, like honey banana by Wilson Zero, it's two different populations crossed.
[52:36.210 --> 52:43.730]  But you don't see that many, like digging deeper and going further into the gene pool.
[52:44.450 --> 52:47.170]  One of the interesting things to do is to make S1s.
[52:47.970 --> 52:51.650]  That's kind of the shorthand for self-pollinated first generation.
[52:52.370 --> 52:55.170]  But we make a good amount of them when we make seed lines.
[52:55.170 --> 52:59.410]  And what it does a lot of is allow us to learn about the parent
[52:59.410 --> 53:04.210]  and what the allele frequency at the parents are.
[53:04.210 --> 53:07.970]  This is all great stuff if you're interested in this, just like Google these words.
[53:09.730 --> 53:12.850]  Definitely recommend you Google Hardy Weinberg analysis,
[53:13.490 --> 53:19.090]  which is a really fascinating mathematical model to convert allele frequency or like
[53:19.730 --> 53:23.170]  what you see in the field to actually like analyzing the genome.
[53:23.170 --> 53:26.450]  So before they had genome sequencing, that's how they were able to map,
[53:27.410 --> 53:31.410]  quote unquote, map the genome of a plant by using its,
[53:33.090 --> 53:36.530]  the frequency and pattern of its recombination.
[53:37.330 --> 53:41.170]  And this is like Mendelian genetics where you start to see some of those recessive traits
[53:41.890 --> 53:46.370]  in the F2 generation or the S1 generation, which are very, very similar.
[53:46.930 --> 53:50.930]  And we're not going to dig too deep into this, but really interesting stuff when we're talking
[53:50.930 --> 53:56.370]  about getting to that next phase of phenohunting and breeding is using techniques like this.
[53:57.650 --> 54:02.450]  I like how it was like the most advanced bro science they had before genomics back then.
[54:03.090 --> 54:07.330]  I always marvel at being in the now and looking at it as the past.
[54:07.890 --> 54:13.250]  I wonder how, what we're doing now on the cutting edge of medical cannabis will be looked at in like
[54:13.250 --> 54:17.170]  a couple of hundred years, you know, it's like, will it be like, Oh, before this, like these guys
[54:17.170 --> 54:20.930]  were really trying, like, I love it that it's always the cutting edge of stuff. It's just.
[54:21.650 --> 54:26.530]  Yeah. You know, I love, I love the idea that even though the genetics, you know,
[54:27.410 --> 54:31.570]  genomics and genetic sequencing companies and the tools which we're going to talk about a second are
[54:31.570 --> 54:38.530]  so advanced, like there's still so many, most of the plants in the world got there with these
[54:38.530 --> 54:45.490]  techniques and, you know, Gregor Mendel, you know, crossing P varieties and just being like, Huh.
[54:46.690 --> 54:51.010]  It's just fascinating that those techniques stood the test of time and are still being used today.
[54:51.010 --> 54:56.690]  And to me, there's still the most valuable tool for cannabis out there to make great varieties.
[54:57.250 --> 55:02.290]  Okay. Tools for pheno hunting, obviously potency and terpene analysis is really important,
[55:02.290 --> 55:07.090]  especially for commercial growers. So, you know, providers like SC labs and Bell Costa labs are
[55:07.090 --> 55:12.050]  excellent, excellent providers of services that can give you a ton of information when you do those
[55:12.050 --> 55:23.010]  COAs. Purple scientific makes a handheld THC potency measuring device. So you can imagine if
[55:23.490 --> 55:31.250]  you're doing a thousand seed pheno hunt, boy, that helps you screen a lot. So what a cool tool to use.
[55:31.250 --> 55:34.930]  And that's something that I'm really excited to like, get more into and employ more.
[55:36.450 --> 55:42.050]  Genomics companies are also making a lot of tools such as snip chips and other panels.
[55:42.050 --> 55:47.650]  And this is the foundation of marker assisted selection, rapid genomics, trilogy, leaf works,
[55:47.650 --> 55:52.610]  again, medicinal genomics. These are all really interesting companies that can provide tools for
[55:53.330 --> 56:00.530]  those people. And sex testing is probably the most basic version of that. But all these companies are
[56:00.530 --> 56:08.530]  working to make additional really valuable and really exciting tools that can help pheno hunters
[56:08.530 --> 56:15.090]  not even go to the flowering phase, but it's a seedling and you put a tiny cutting of a leaf
[56:15.090 --> 56:20.290]  and it can tell you, for instance, what cannabinoids it should make, which is like,
[56:20.850 --> 56:24.770]  when we really are able to use those tools to the next level, this is going to radically
[56:24.770 --> 56:32.610]  revolutionize cannabis pheno hunting and breeding. Lastly, I'll say that the art of
[56:33.570 --> 56:41.330]  actually grading the sensory of these in a really specific way is something that I'm really excited
[56:41.330 --> 56:49.010]  about the people pushing this forward. And Kevin Jodry, who pioneered the Ganjie program,
[56:49.010 --> 56:55.490]  it's kind of like a Somali, right? Ganjie program, has this really cool principle of fruit,
[56:55.490 --> 57:01.650]  floral, fuel, and earth being the kind of cornerstones of flavor. And to me, almost like
[57:01.650 --> 57:07.890]  wine tasting, like really digging into how, you know, not just be like, oh, it smells, it's fire,
[57:07.890 --> 57:14.290]  but like really digging into all the different aspects of that really fascinate me. And the
[57:14.290 --> 57:18.770]  perfect tasting event where you really get a lot of people's feedback and you're able to channel
[57:18.770 --> 57:25.490]  all that sensory experience into like data, the science behind that is still like, the way that's
[57:25.490 --> 57:30.690]  done is still very much being pioneered right now. And, you know, the Ganjies are one of the
[57:30.690 --> 57:36.690]  most interesting groups out there. This thing on the right is something that I just made. I
[57:36.690 --> 57:41.810]  really want to adapt it to the Ganjie map, but using something like this, and I should be like,
[57:41.810 --> 57:46.610]  wow, it smells sweet. And I go, okay, what kind of sweet, right? Or filling those in those bubbles,
[57:46.610 --> 57:52.450]  I think is a cool way to guide your palate. I like the musky section. I feel like that one
[57:52.450 --> 57:57.650]  gets overlooked, like kind of like basement or carrot turps or just like subtle ones that
[57:57.650 --> 58:01.090]  they get overlooked that aren't that common, but are cool nonetheless.
[58:01.890 --> 58:08.610]  Or kind of like a background note, like some of the things, you know, I think less tuned or more
[58:08.610 --> 58:13.650]  newcomers to the space usually get like the, I like to call it like the melody, like the forefront
[58:13.650 --> 58:20.530]  nose, but then there's oftentimes a base note behind it to something else. And if a strawberry
[58:23.730 --> 58:29.890]  flavor is presented with a sour citrus, it comes off a lot different than if it's presented with
[58:29.890 --> 58:34.930]  a cushy cream, right? Those are totally different experiences, both of them as well like strawberry.
[58:34.930 --> 58:41.330]  So how you actually present that, and then I do think, you know, commercial cannabis,
[58:42.290 --> 58:49.810]  when we're actually making these descriptions on the packaging, really actually having the person
[58:49.810 --> 58:55.970]  read something, go, ooh, like, you know, industrial sealant, acrid, lime, lemon, apricot,
[58:55.970 --> 59:01.250]  hibiscus, and then it like sort of actually smells like that is a lot more compelling than kind of
[59:01.250 --> 59:06.770]  doing a word salad of something that it could smell like that markets. So there's a lot more
[59:06.770 --> 59:10.770]  to do. Do you have a specific genetic that you were just describing that was specific? I wanted
[59:11.010 --> 59:16.210]  to know what it was, if it was too. No, I just randomly scanned my eyes over that slide.
[59:16.210 --> 59:21.090]  Like lemon fuel cleaner, you have me there, and then cooler and cooler.
[59:21.650 --> 59:27.170]  Well, I mean, I will say, I will do like shameless plug of this gastropop seed line we have.
[59:27.170 --> 59:33.010]  Oh, hell yeah. And gastropop is just really remarkable because it combines some of the like,
[59:33.490 --> 59:41.810]  some of the more savory, especially like kerosene and fuel aromas with some really like nice sour
[59:41.810 --> 59:50.290]  and bright berry and like kiwi. So it's really remarkable. And to me, the thing that, you know,
[59:50.290 --> 59:56.130]  I'll tell anyone who listens about the gastropop aroma specifically, because it's selected for aroma.
[59:56.770 --> 01:00:00.050]  Is that a line or that's like one of the selections that you guys did out of the lab?
[01:00:00.930 --> 01:00:07.570]  Yes. Yeah. So gastropop five is a clone. Yeah. The clone, a clone we have, and we just released
[01:00:07.570 --> 01:00:13.250]  a seed line related to it. So those are available now and we'll have a lot more crosses coming. So
[01:00:13.250 --> 01:00:18.450]  get excited about that. And, you know, check out our website if you want to learn more about that
[01:00:18.450 --> 01:00:25.170]  and purchase seeds. But the thing about that and what we've seen translates to its progeny
[01:00:25.170 --> 01:00:31.730]  and what it gets crossed to is that like if you smell it and taste it, the taste and the smell
[01:00:31.730 --> 01:00:38.610]  don't, it's not like a one. It's not just like that, you know, OK, like kiwi. It seems to like
[01:00:38.610 --> 01:00:43.410]  a vault. It's a whole movement. And no one smells that jar. It goes, cool. Yeah, I got it. Everyone
[01:00:43.410 --> 01:00:48.210]  like smells it and smells it again and again and again. Keep coming up with more adjectives and
[01:00:48.210 --> 01:00:52.850]  fill in more boxes. That's when we look around and go like, I think we really have something here.
[01:00:52.930 --> 01:00:57.170]  And it's intriguing and it makes people really think and it brings back memories. And
[01:00:58.210 --> 01:01:01.170]  it's not kind of one dimensional. So that's something we're very, very excited about.
[01:01:01.170 --> 01:01:06.290]  When you guys find one that special, are you guys kind of like cracking the jars each day to test it
[01:01:06.290 --> 01:01:11.010]  out? Because one like that, I feel like could develop very dynamically through the cure,
[01:01:11.010 --> 01:01:15.890]  where if it has that going on, like each day could almost be like I use sometimes I like
[01:01:16.450 --> 01:01:21.330]  doing a smoke like the first 20 days or so. And sometimes they'll like it's like a different
[01:01:21.330 --> 01:01:27.010]  variety each time. It's absolutely like and there's some stuff like sorry till it gets where
[01:01:27.010 --> 01:01:31.490]  it's going, till they all kind of marry and the flavors mellow out. But sometimes they're a trip
[01:01:31.490 --> 01:01:38.130]  like on the way to getting there. Absolutely. No. And as it in any commercial producer has to assume
[01:01:38.130 --> 01:01:43.250]  that the weed that actually gets sold is going to be more oxidized than whatever you smelled
[01:01:43.250 --> 01:01:47.410]  right on the fresh, even if you ground it up right after trimming it. Right. So if you are
[01:01:47.410 --> 01:01:52.130]  selecting commercially, you got to think you got to do what you just did, which is like, OK,
[01:01:52.130 --> 01:01:57.890]  crack the jar a month later. Is it still fire? OK. Awesome. Right. And that profile definitely
[01:01:57.890 --> 01:02:04.210]  changes as time goes on. So that's a really good point. Some some stuff seems to go to that,
[01:02:04.210 --> 01:02:11.010]  like kind of a weird like I've talked to I talked recently about certain aromas that like disappear
[01:02:11.010 --> 01:02:16.690]  real easy. Watermelon and cherry to me, it like blows away with like a gust of wind. You're like
[01:02:16.690 --> 01:02:22.050]  it's gone. Right. But if you get it right at that fresh moment, it's delightful. But I don't think
[01:02:22.050 --> 01:02:26.850]  I've had those same conversations and it seems like mostly fruity ones for us, like specifically
[01:02:26.850 --> 01:02:32.690]  this purple diesel that we had in like around 2010, as soon as it was combustible was the best
[01:02:32.690 --> 01:02:38.050]  time to smoke it, like almost still wet, like Biester's, like, you know, not even fully dry,
[01:02:38.050 --> 01:02:45.250]  let alone cured. It had all that great flavor, like the least amount of dry, but still combustible.
[01:02:45.330 --> 01:02:48.290]  So strange. We've nerded out about that, too. I don't really get it.
[01:02:49.170 --> 01:02:52.770]  Yeah. And other turps that seem to like last forever, like you can find,
[01:02:52.770 --> 01:02:57.250]  you know, I've talked about like, you know, bags you find in the center console of your car three
[01:02:57.250 --> 01:03:00.930]  months later, like, oh, and you smell it like that's fire. Like, wow. Like, how the heck do
[01:03:00.930 --> 01:03:06.930]  that? You know, there's certain things that do that. So very interesting. So, yeah, I think
[01:03:06.930 --> 01:03:10.930]  that's that's the whole presentation. I'd love to. Yeah. Questions, comments, comment section,
[01:03:11.890 --> 01:03:18.290]  open it up to whatever we want to do here. Amazing. Yeah, I don't know if it's the thiols
[01:03:18.290 --> 01:03:23.330]  or something more than just the terpenes. Like that's something that we speculate about just
[01:03:23.330 --> 01:03:27.490]  from like, you know, you know, just our point of view or whatever. But it's got to be something
[01:03:27.490 --> 01:03:33.970]  different that like it cures away and becomes like plantier and like more hay like as it should be at
[01:03:33.970 --> 01:03:37.730]  the sweet spot. Some of them are like that definitely intrigues me. Well, like going back
[01:03:37.730 --> 01:03:43.170]  to the gun, you think to the nose is still the best tool for actually determining quality.
[01:03:43.170 --> 01:03:49.410]  Yeah. Unfortunately, terpene tests like they can tell you a lot. It's important. But here's a
[01:03:49.410 --> 01:03:56.690]  really great example. GMO Starfighter Wi-Fi cut we have, which is like freak plant, but heavy on
[01:03:56.690 --> 01:04:05.890]  the GMO. It's like a rotting, like rotting gym socks, like disgusting. It's extremely foul smelling,
[01:04:05.890 --> 01:04:11.170]  right? It has like the same exact terpene analysis is one that like smells like grapes.
[01:04:13.010 --> 01:04:18.370]  So the terpene analysis can't tell me that this is absolute accurate, you know, disgusting. Like
[01:04:18.370 --> 01:04:23.410]  it's not doing enough in the nose. You give that to anyone. It's not subtle like it's rank.
[01:04:23.970 --> 01:04:32.050]  So interesting example that. I haven't found a question yet, but one thing that I wanted to touch
[01:04:32.050 --> 01:04:39.490]  on to get some feedback, I feel like if you have enough space, putting the testers into a room
[01:04:40.210 --> 01:04:46.610]  that is about done with flowering to get their initial set going so that even if there is some
[01:04:46.610 --> 01:04:51.170]  rogue pollen that you don't catch, there's a minimal chance that it's going to cause any
[01:04:51.170 --> 01:04:56.210]  problems. And then if that room is going in, staying in flower, you'll get kind of like the
[01:04:56.210 --> 01:05:01.490]  first three weeks of the next round where they're not necessarily like full flower yet. So they're
[01:05:01.490 --> 01:05:06.450]  not vulnerable. So I wanted to ask, like, if you have any thoughts on that, that's something I try
[01:05:06.450 --> 01:05:13.090]  to employ every time, if the situation's available, just because like, it just minimizes the risk of
[01:05:13.090 --> 01:05:17.890]  pollen flying just in case you miss a herm or something, you know, explain that to me again,
[01:05:17.890 --> 01:05:22.290]  you're talking about like layering different runs of flowering. Exactly. So let's say flower room
[01:05:22.290 --> 01:05:28.130]  one is eight weeks done with flower on a 10 week flower run. You put your tester clones that are
[01:05:28.210 --> 01:05:33.490]  rooted in their one gallon into there. You let them, you know, sit in there for two weeks. They're
[01:05:33.490 --> 01:05:39.090]  just starting to show what they're doing. That room clears out. And then now that that room is
[01:05:39.090 --> 01:05:45.250]  on day zero, day one of flower, those seed, those testers are going to have another three weeks,
[01:05:45.250 --> 01:05:49.570]  really, or so before the plants are vulnerable to pollen because they're just flipping. They're
[01:05:49.570 --> 01:05:55.010]  just kind of still vegging, essentially. So that's a strategy that I've grown to employ from, you
[01:05:55.010 --> 01:06:00.690]  know, making mistakes. And I feel like if you can do that, it helps minimize the chance of pollen
[01:06:00.690 --> 01:06:04.850]  flying around. Then by the chance, by the time the flower room is actually setting in, you should
[01:06:04.850 --> 01:06:08.850]  know by then, or it's probably sterile pollen that's going to fly, you know, is like my thought
[01:06:08.850 --> 01:06:15.810]  process. Or it doesn't, it doesn't necessarily, even if it gets pollinated at week seven, it can't
[01:06:15.810 --> 01:06:19.570]  form a seed at that point. It's like, just going to be a little like, you know, micro nothing.
[01:06:20.770 --> 01:06:24.690]  But yeah, no, that's an interesting technique to use. I mean, I think that would be for like a
[01:06:24.690 --> 01:06:28.210]  homegrower technique. I don't think that that would be something employed commercially, but
[01:06:28.210 --> 01:06:34.530]  Yeah, space is like too important on like scale. Yeah. But I feel like to prevent something wrong
[01:06:34.530 --> 01:06:39.730]  happening, like if they did dedicate or engineer that space in the room and kind of plant it into
[01:06:39.730 --> 01:06:45.890]  the SOPs, I think, I think it could help alleviate problems, even for big grows. It takes up space.
[01:06:45.890 --> 01:06:46.850]  It takes time, but
[01:06:47.410 --> 01:06:53.010]  Well, that's a good, that's a good point. Like, I mean, this goes back to the slide of like
[01:06:53.890 --> 01:06:57.730]  growing strategy that like the growth strategy for pheno hunting, you got to like, really think like,
[01:06:57.730 --> 01:07:01.570]  wait, we can break all the rules here. You know what I mean? This is like different, right?
[01:07:01.570 --> 01:07:06.690]  So one of the things I've thought of is like, what about high throughput pheno hunting in like,
[01:07:06.690 --> 01:07:12.370]  you know, four inch tall plants or something like that, right. Just to screen out some initial,
[01:07:12.370 --> 01:07:15.810]  you know, for, for a growth strategy where you're just trying to find a certain terp or something
[01:07:15.810 --> 01:07:19.650]  like that. Right. It's something you could do. And I think it would be really interesting.
[01:07:19.650 --> 01:07:23.890]  I'd love to go to the comment section, if we can get some questions or anything like that.
[01:07:25.170 --> 01:07:27.490]  Absolutely. I was just scrolling through before.
[01:07:31.550 --> 01:07:36.350]  And if anyone has any comments, throw them in there. I've been busy rolling my blunt as usual,
[01:07:36.350 --> 01:07:36.850]  but.
[01:07:39.390 --> 01:07:47.230]  So Chilbert from UK has a not be, not be topped when pheno hunting. If it's running from the
[01:07:47.310 --> 01:07:51.710]  seedling, I wouldn't recommend it because if you have the parallel nodes sites,
[01:07:51.710 --> 01:07:56.030]  you kind of get an oddball plant morphology from that. And we talked about the lower earlier that
[01:07:56.030 --> 01:08:01.710]  like you can top it if you then use that clone and flower that clone. But if you're flowering
[01:08:01.710 --> 01:08:08.670]  the plant, don't top the, don't top the plant. Here's one that just popped up that I could
[01:08:08.670 --> 01:08:12.750]  go on for days about at what point should we be renaming things?
[01:08:13.870 --> 01:08:14.590]  Oh boy.
[01:08:15.390 --> 01:08:20.350]  Yeah. Maybe we won't go there. Cause I can go and that one. So I have a lot of firm opinions.
[01:08:21.790 --> 01:08:23.390]  Dude, hot take. What's your opinion?
[01:08:24.110 --> 01:08:29.870]  Okay. What's, what's it, let me ask you a hot seat. What's a cultivar is, is, is a,
[01:08:29.870 --> 01:08:32.190]  what's a common one is skunk number one, a cultivar.
[01:08:34.510 --> 01:08:39.310]  Well, you've, you've, it's, it's, this is kind of odd. If there's a number next to it,
[01:08:39.310 --> 01:08:40.510]  how many skunk number one's are there?
[01:08:40.510 --> 01:08:42.910]  I assume it's a clone and it's a cultivar,
[01:08:42.910 --> 01:08:46.350]  but I know people have like sold seeds of skunk number one. So I think the rules are
[01:08:46.350 --> 01:08:50.670]  getting a little blurry at this point. There's no set hard rules. And, and you know, there are
[01:08:50.670 --> 01:08:57.550]  rules once cannabis, if cannabis gets federally legalized, the USDA will actually enforce this
[01:08:57.550 --> 01:09:03.630]  shit, which is like kind of crazy to think about. But, but like, you won't be able to sell that.
[01:09:03.630 --> 01:09:07.710]  They'll be like, you can't number that. That's a cultivar. There'll be a cultivar registry,
[01:09:07.710 --> 01:09:09.870]  which other plants have, there's like a list.
[01:09:10.430 --> 01:09:15.870]  Um, I personally don't like that term, how it gets used in cannabis, almost similar to phenotype
[01:09:15.870 --> 01:09:21.150]  where it's like, what does it really mean? Because it seems like to me, if someone got
[01:09:21.150 --> 01:09:25.550]  a pack of skunk number one, they're going to call that a skunk number one cultivar,
[01:09:25.550 --> 01:09:29.150]  where there's gotta be tens of thousands of those on the planet. You know, to me,
[01:09:30.030 --> 01:09:36.750]  it should be that one genetic, whether it's some assist or whether it has sisters or many sisters,
[01:09:36.830 --> 01:09:42.510]  you know, it's the one genetic. And it's like, that's when names change to me. If it's special
[01:09:42.510 --> 01:09:47.310]  enough to be its own genetic, it should have its own name. It's not skunk number one anymore.
[01:09:47.310 --> 01:09:55.150]  Now it's pot of gold or your Exodus cheese or any of the number of individual ones that came
[01:09:55.150 --> 01:10:01.310]  from skunk number one to me, like UK cheese deserves a name, you know, the other 10,000
[01:10:01.310 --> 01:10:05.950]  that came from skunk one that aren't that special. Like, so you're touching on a really important
[01:10:05.950 --> 01:10:11.470]  point, Travis, which I think, and this is kind of the general rule of thumb, but I try to follow
[01:10:11.470 --> 01:10:17.070]  too. If you make a cross and it's really something new, like it has a new expression, it should get
[01:10:17.070 --> 01:10:22.510]  a new name. If it's just like another improved version of the parents, you know, it could just
[01:10:22.510 --> 01:10:28.190]  be like, or you might see stuff like a sour diesel BX. You know what I mean? It's like,
[01:10:28.190 --> 01:10:31.710]  you're just trying to work the sour diesel line. You're not trying to be like, you know,
[01:10:32.030 --> 01:10:36.270]  you know, yeah, lobster, lobster, kush. You know what I mean? You're not trying to like,
[01:10:36.270 --> 01:10:41.710]  that's kind of weird. So I think we should be naming more according to like what profile or
[01:10:41.710 --> 01:10:47.550]  like what the plant is actually like and stop doing too much word salad. I don't know. Yeah.
[01:10:48.270 --> 01:10:52.830]  Um, really quick that, uh, in line, it has to be special enough. Like you say, if it's something
[01:10:52.830 --> 01:10:57.950]  new and it's like, but that's where I get muddled up. So like, then what does cultivar actually
[01:10:57.950 --> 01:11:03.070]  mean? Because you can't name every skunk number one. It's like, you just have to say my genetic
[01:11:03.070 --> 01:11:06.670]  or like the genetic I'm running. I feel like you have to be very vague since none of us
[01:11:07.550 --> 01:11:13.470]  can convey exactly what we're talking about. Exactly. Um, we have some really interesting
[01:11:13.470 --> 01:11:18.430]  comment here from genetic memory farms, um, talking about first labor has been esters.
[01:11:18.430 --> 01:11:23.630]  So esters, thiols, flattened flavonoids being like a kind of broader category of that. We
[01:11:23.630 --> 01:11:29.070]  definitely need to discover more of the actual chemical profiles, not discover them, but be, uh,
[01:11:29.630 --> 01:11:34.350]  essentially have cheaper ways of doing it. Um, mass spec and, uh, chromatography is probably the
[01:11:34.350 --> 01:11:38.910]  best thing, but, um, boy, it's not really, you know, the test can't exactly tell us if something
[01:11:38.910 --> 01:11:46.750]  smells just yet. Um, very interesting. Um, how do you feel about running a big phenol hunt in a
[01:11:46.750 --> 01:11:52.270]  large container instead of necessarily four inch containers? So I was thinking like, let's say a
[01:11:52.270 --> 01:11:58.190]  20 gallon smart pot, 30 gallons, smart pop 40 X, Y, Z, and just throwing like, you know, 50 seeds
[01:11:58.190 --> 01:12:04.110]  in that and start calling them early, like ones that are just showing that they're probably not it.
[01:12:04.110 --> 01:12:08.910]  And then by the end, maybe having like, you know, five, 10 left in there. And at least like you say,
[01:12:08.910 --> 01:12:12.670]  if you're going for a certain aroma or something specific, you can at least kind of
[01:12:14.030 --> 01:12:18.190]  look through a bunch and not so much space, you know? So I think one of the problems with that,
[01:12:18.910 --> 01:12:23.630]  and this goes to my like evolutionary biology background, your main screening, your main
[01:12:23.630 --> 01:12:30.110]  evolutionary pressure, like selection pressure is competitive advantage. How well does it compete
[01:12:30.110 --> 01:12:35.070]  against its friends? Right. If you don't care about, if you didn't grow in that way and then
[01:12:35.070 --> 01:12:38.990]  you don't care down the line, you don't care how well it competes against its friends. Cause you're
[01:12:38.990 --> 01:12:41.950]  not going to grow like that. Then like, why apply that pressure? Cause you might have a
[01:12:41.950 --> 01:12:45.470]  seedling that gets overpowered by its friends and you go, ah, and you kill it. And that might've
[01:12:45.470 --> 01:12:51.150]  been the one, you know, like, eh. So, I mean, it's an interesting, and again, like with the
[01:12:51.150 --> 01:12:57.150]  clone strategy we talked about earlier of, you know, going in week four to six, if you just like
[01:12:57.150 --> 01:13:02.510]  sow seeds like Johnny Appleseed over there, that's a great strategy. Grow them. If you see something
[01:13:02.510 --> 01:13:07.710]  really special, clone the backup. But I think that's a great strategy for people who have
[01:13:07.710 --> 01:13:12.750]  properties, who have, you know, who have houses in large yards, you know, live up in Humboldt or,
[01:13:13.710 --> 01:13:19.470]  you know, in one of the more rural areas of California or the world and can easily grow a
[01:13:19.470 --> 01:13:23.630]  lot of seeds. Like do that. Like you don't have to do what we do, which is like carefully logging
[01:13:23.630 --> 01:13:27.550]  each and every seedling in each and every plant. Yeah. I was kind of just thinking that, like,
[01:13:27.550 --> 01:13:32.190]  maybe do it just as the main focus, the like, the top priority would be just to observe the
[01:13:32.190 --> 01:13:37.070]  population with a second or third approach as like, if something special pops up, of course,
[01:13:37.070 --> 01:13:41.550]  try to keep it, but maybe really just to like look at a big population and then the competitive
[01:13:42.430 --> 01:13:45.950]  kind of just fits in with it. Survival of the fittest. I'll just get to observe and learn,
[01:13:45.950 --> 01:13:54.990]  you know? Of course. Yeah. So I'd love to put a link on, some people are asking about a
[01:13:57.790 --> 01:14:03.630]  link to buy seeds. I can put that. So here at compoundgenetics.com, I think we actually have
[01:14:03.630 --> 01:14:09.550]  some website problems at the current moment, but stay on with that and we can buy seeds there.
[01:14:10.190 --> 01:14:18.110]  Get seeds from the partners. Then I'll also post in our discord, which is a really great
[01:14:18.990 --> 01:14:23.870]  channel to get into. If you like content like this, we actually, I actually do like an AMA
[01:14:23.870 --> 01:14:30.270]  every month and we just update like all the different breeding projects and talk about
[01:14:30.270 --> 01:14:36.270]  pheno hunting and, you know, and do stuff like, you know, just look through all the different jars
[01:14:36.270 --> 01:14:40.670]  of all the different phenos and just talk through them and stuff like that. It's kind of engage our
[01:14:40.670 --> 01:14:54.150]  community. So it's a lot of fun. Getting a lot of, a lot of hate on the ganja program.
[01:14:55.830 --> 01:15:00.630]  Yeah, I have my opinions, but I won't go there. One thing I will say is that I heard one of them
[01:15:01.270 --> 01:15:06.150]  talking about how purple punch was their go-to recently. And that really made me question the
[01:15:06.150 --> 01:15:14.070]  whole universe, not just their program. So I pride myself on finding good in every genetic
[01:15:14.070 --> 01:15:19.990]  that comes in my way, except for blackberry cush and purple punch. Like I truly just don't like
[01:15:19.990 --> 01:15:25.670]  those ones. I think they should be purged from the culture. And to hear someone that has the
[01:15:25.670 --> 01:15:32.390]  rubber stamp referencing that as his go-to, it made me question everything, not just them.
[01:15:32.870 --> 01:15:39.350]  You know, I'm not going to, I can't endorse individual preferences or flavors, but I think
[01:15:40.790 --> 01:15:44.870]  what I'm trying to draw on is that, is that trying to create some standardization behind it. They're
[01:15:44.870 --> 01:15:50.950]  trying to create a shared lexicon. And I hear way too much that's fire. And it's like, what else,
[01:15:50.950 --> 01:15:54.310]  what else you got there? And it's like, it's fire. And it's like, I want to, I want to be able to
[01:15:54.310 --> 01:15:58.310]  look at like, you know, talk about some of those flavors and talk about why they're there and how
[01:15:58.310 --> 01:16:06.870]  we're picking those up. It's like, what's your say from that? I mean, this is what you do. Like,
[01:16:06.870 --> 01:16:11.430]  what's your opinion on purple punch? Let's go there. It's all opinion bearing mind.
[01:16:12.950 --> 01:16:16.630]  It's a really strong greenhouse grower. I don't care for the flower. I'm not going to smoke it.
[01:16:17.670 --> 01:16:18.230]  Garbage.
[01:16:20.310 --> 01:16:25.670]  But, you know, symbiotic did an awesome job with that being a, being an incredibly
[01:16:26.630 --> 01:16:32.710]  stable and reliably purple fading. And like, we got to put, we got to give purple punch.
[01:16:33.430 --> 01:16:41.430]  It's due credit, which is, it has the look. It helped to develop the look that we all want now.
[01:16:41.990 --> 01:16:45.510]  Does it have the terp? No, but it's a stepping stone. It's in the evolution of this game.
[01:16:46.230 --> 01:16:49.750]  It's very true. It has respect. If it doesn't have much love from me, that's fair.
[01:16:50.710 --> 01:16:55.590]  I would agree with that. I think that's, I think that's agreeable. But you know, flavors,
[01:16:55.590 --> 01:17:02.870]  flavors wise, you know, I'm really into like sour flavors. I really want to see more like
[01:17:02.870 --> 01:17:09.670]  chem and sour, you know, like citrus aromas, but not, but the ones that really make you're like,
[01:17:09.670 --> 01:17:15.830]  make you pucker when you smell it. Real chems that don't, chems with bag of peel is something
[01:17:15.830 --> 01:17:23.270]  that we're really trying to dig through purple coloration of chems. And I really also like some
[01:17:23.270 --> 01:17:30.470]  of the incense in like herbal smells, like some of those really interesting, like Afghanis and
[01:17:30.470 --> 01:17:36.550]  some of the stuff that, you know, a little plug here of a count, or I'm probably going to butcher
[01:17:36.550 --> 01:17:47.110]  the name, Arasinig, I think the Afghani project seed line where dug through all the different land
[01:17:47.110 --> 01:17:52.230]  races in Afghanistan. I know that he's really stoked on some of the like rotting animal terps
[01:17:52.230 --> 01:18:01.030]  and foul, incensy, some terps that uses like really don't see very often, unless you're working with
[01:18:01.030 --> 01:18:04.790]  like a GMO, but I'm really into a lot of those different flavors. I don't know what the chat
[01:18:04.790 --> 01:18:12.630]  thinks about some of that, but. I'm stuck on the NL5 hazy ones right now, you know, it's the
[01:18:13.350 --> 01:18:18.950]  culture calls it a million things, but I'm really on that like flavor right now for sure. Well, the
[01:18:20.710 --> 01:18:26.790]  the obviously the haze terp, like terpinaline is the favorite thing to hate these days as well.
[01:18:27.670 --> 01:18:32.070]  I think this one's actually usually mercine dominant, like the, you know, most of these
[01:18:32.070 --> 01:18:41.110]  versions of the NL5. Yeah, I see some apple fritter talk in here and stuff like that, but
[01:18:41.750 --> 01:18:46.070]  I just need some compound gear. It's just a button to get some of that flavor back, but.
[01:18:47.670 --> 01:18:52.310]  How about you guys for washers? Are you guys focused on that? Do you guys have good feedback
[01:18:52.310 --> 01:18:56.550]  just by, you know, by chance without focusing on it? Did anything pop up that was interesting?
[01:18:56.790 --> 01:19:02.470]  What's your take on that? You know, absolutely. There's a couple of things with washing that's
[01:19:02.470 --> 01:19:07.590]  really interesting. We're definitely getting more into that. We're working with Kali extracts and a
[01:19:07.590 --> 01:19:13.190]  lot of that, and we do like kind of a test washing program with Kali and they just do awesome work.
[01:19:13.190 --> 01:19:22.470]  Kali extracts there, Mark there just kicks ass. But we do test, often do test washes, and Dan on
[01:19:22.470 --> 01:19:27.910]  our team is kind of like the dab master as far as like really, really getting into it and being
[01:19:27.910 --> 01:19:34.390]  really kind of served the aroma and texture and experience of especially solventless extract.
[01:19:35.350 --> 01:19:42.790]  But yeah, we've definitely found some recent like 3% plusers. We've gotten some 5%ers.
[01:19:44.310 --> 01:19:52.150]  I'm also working with BioVortex, Jesse, Jesse Dottabio Vortex to work some cherry lime dog
[01:19:52.150 --> 01:19:58.550]  crosses that are like legendary for washing efficiency. So if we have any cherry lime dog
[01:19:59.270 --> 01:20:04.310]  Northern California fans in the chat, I'd love to hear about that. But I really love...
[01:20:05.190 --> 01:20:12.070]  When you say washing efficiency, my antenna pop up, does that encompass ease of growing,
[01:20:12.070 --> 01:20:19.350]  biomass per square foot, harvest and wash, or just focused on the actual after it's frozen,
[01:20:19.350 --> 01:20:25.190]  frozen and beyond? Frozen and beyond, just that. It's literally, it's a specific trait of how
[01:20:25.190 --> 01:20:30.710]  easily the trichome head like falls off the stock. And yeah, it's remarkable. We just washed...
[01:20:30.710 --> 01:20:34.390]  I thought you guys were already on like the whole thing. I was like, okay, let's go.
[01:20:35.750 --> 01:20:45.190]  Take me there. Okay. I see a turgidity saying cedar and pine, pining. Yes, I'm all about pining.
[01:20:45.190 --> 01:20:48.790]  And pining is like kind of dead these days. Like you don't see it that often. I want more pining
[01:20:48.790 --> 01:20:54.310]  strains for sure. I see somebody's talking about the strawberry cannoli in there as well. That's
[01:20:54.310 --> 01:21:01.830]  the T that's probably the tastiest dab I had at 2022. That was, I think it tested 11.5% turps.
[01:21:01.830 --> 01:21:05.590]  And when the lab called them, they were like, this has to be a mistake. They're like, no,
[01:21:05.590 --> 01:21:10.550]  we already double tested it and sent it out. They're like, and we sent it out to other labs.
[01:21:10.550 --> 01:21:17.510]  It's legit. Oh my God. It wasn't too stony because it was so turpy and it hurt the throat a little
[01:21:17.510 --> 01:21:22.950]  bit. You had to take like a little cooler dab or a baby dab. Oh my God. It was more strawberry than
[01:21:22.950 --> 01:21:27.270]  artificial strawberry, like jam or something or like a strawberry freezy pop. It was more
[01:21:27.270 --> 01:21:31.830]  strawberry than like a real one. It was crazy. Whose gear is that? I'm curious now. I haven't
[01:21:31.830 --> 01:21:38.150]  seen that around. That sounds weird. I'm not sure. I just know the homies who run it are Aloha
[01:21:38.150 --> 01:21:43.670]  Apothecary and then Mitch Hill is a Washington Forum. But I think that's the first time I bought
[01:21:43.670 --> 01:21:49.510]  hash in over a decade and it was worth it. Awesome. Yeah. I got to check that one out.
[01:21:49.510 --> 01:21:53.590]  11% turps. That seems like mind blowing. 3% is high. What are we talking about?
[01:21:53.590 --> 01:21:58.470]  They had three different sun grown varieties this year that weren't too genetically related
[01:21:58.470 --> 01:22:02.550]  that tested over 10%. And these were all like double tested because the lab didn't believe
[01:22:02.550 --> 01:22:07.190]  it either. And they're doing something. They're up to something. Wow. Very exciting. I think the
[01:22:07.190 --> 01:22:12.150]  highest one was almost 13, like 12.7 or something obnoxious. It was crazy.
[01:22:12.150 --> 01:22:16.870]  Well, this is where the sun grown guys really just smash all the chirping numbers. No one can
[01:22:16.870 --> 01:22:23.910]  compete with that. And I'll go on the hot mic and say that the best cannabis in the world is grown
[01:22:23.910 --> 01:22:32.710]  by the living soil, often sun grown or greenhouse protected, but it's got to be living soil grown.
[01:22:32.710 --> 01:22:38.070]  And that's the best of the best in the world to me. But it's such an art. It's an art form to do
[01:22:38.070 --> 01:22:44.310]  it like that. And I commend anyone who grows in that style for sure. I'm pretty sure they're
[01:22:44.310 --> 01:22:51.430]  regenerative. And the crazy variable though is it's the main sun, northern New England outdoors.
[01:22:51.430 --> 01:22:58.550]  And so it could have been a positive stress, but they really crushed it. Definitely. Definitely.
[01:22:59.110 --> 01:23:08.710]  Any more questions on the presentation on the chat here? I'd love to see what you guys think
[01:23:08.710 --> 01:23:15.830]  about if this was helpful for you guys for pheno hunting at home, or if you had any questions
[01:23:15.830 --> 01:23:21.350]  about some of the lexicon or stuff we're working through on the actual presentation, or if we just
[01:23:21.350 --> 01:23:27.510]  want to get more into flavors or yeah, whatever you think there, Travis. How many of you do you
[01:23:27.510 --> 01:23:31.270]  usually run through for flavor testing? Because this is actually something I'm kind of concerned
[01:23:31.270 --> 01:23:35.270]  with this time. I have so many winners. Like I was saying, there's 10 at least that I have to run
[01:23:35.270 --> 01:23:40.390]  again. And I only have so much flower because they were small plants. And I'm wondering, should it be
[01:23:40.390 --> 01:23:46.550]  me over a couple mornings or a trusted mouth or two, or what's your guys' approach on that when
[01:23:46.550 --> 01:23:53.270]  it comes to actual human smoke response? That's a great question. Because you do get
[01:23:53.270 --> 01:24:00.470]  kind of a paradox here. I joked around with one of my coworkers being like, okay, new protocol.
[01:24:00.470 --> 01:24:07.910]  We have to smoke each pheno three times in the morning and there's 150. It's like, oh yeah.
[01:24:10.790 --> 01:24:18.470]  So we're all like, we'll never go back to work again. So there is some limit to that. That said,
[01:24:18.550 --> 01:24:23.430]  smoking 15 joints in a night, what are the chances the 15th is the one you'll be like, wow,
[01:24:23.430 --> 01:24:29.110]  this is so... You're always going to be weighted towards the first or second you smoke. I really
[01:24:29.110 --> 01:24:33.750]  don't know how to reconcile that, but that's also why we have tasting events where we try to get a
[01:24:33.750 --> 01:24:40.070]  lot of mouths. Like you said, we try to get as many trusted, good noses and people who know their
[01:24:40.070 --> 01:24:46.390]  flavor and know their weed. And usually it's surprising. Usually everyone independently goes,
[01:24:47.030 --> 01:24:53.030]  we all click to the same stuff. And we have found, for instance, that gastropop is something that,
[01:24:54.150 --> 01:24:58.310]  I think it was like the ninth joint of a night and everyone's like, this is amazing flavor.
[01:24:58.310 --> 01:25:05.830]  And I was like, okay, if it has amazing flavor, if one does shine that late, it's a super,
[01:25:07.190 --> 01:25:12.550]  super smoker. Yes, exactly. And it's that translation from smelling the bag. This is
[01:25:12.550 --> 01:25:16.470]  something we're working a lot too. And the gastropop line is we're really, really working is
[01:25:16.470 --> 01:25:20.230]  you smell the jar and you're like, oh, it smells so good. And you smoke it and it just smells like
[01:25:21.750 --> 01:25:24.630]  nothing. It doesn't taste like anything. It just tastes like hot smoke.
[01:25:25.350 --> 01:25:31.030]  What I want is that smell and then the similar flavor to coat the inside of your mouth.
[01:25:31.590 --> 01:25:38.550]  That's always... And if it cuts through, Jimmy Devine of LA Weekly, he's always talking about,
[01:25:39.030 --> 01:25:44.710]  he always rolls up a lot of blunts. And if it cuts through that too, and it tastes good,
[01:25:45.590 --> 01:25:52.630]  you have something really special. Absolutely. Dude, Nickatee too, really changed my look at it
[01:25:52.630 --> 01:25:56.710]  too. He's like, everyone's baseline is different because he catches a lot of heat for smoking the
[01:25:56.710 --> 01:26:02.630]  spliffs is kind of like his normal go-to. And he's like, trust me, I can taste the difference. This
[01:26:02.630 --> 01:26:06.710]  is my baseline. I know when it's good or bad, just because it might not taste good to you.
[01:26:07.350 --> 01:26:11.750]  It's like, trust me. So that really changed my outlook on it. And I think with that too,
[01:26:11.750 --> 01:26:17.990]  like you said, it'll shine better certain ways too. You can make some rosin, even if it gets
[01:26:17.990 --> 01:26:22.950]  a low yield, it's probably going to taste all right. But you put it through some dirty old
[01:26:22.950 --> 01:26:30.070]  crusty pipe or a cigar. Well, we did do one of our last tasting events with Proper Doinks,
[01:26:30.070 --> 01:26:36.230]  which are like, they make the glass tips for like the, they're like crazy connoisseurs about
[01:26:36.230 --> 01:26:42.310]  having like the perfect joint and that white ash and everything. And I'll say I was a little bit
[01:26:42.310 --> 01:26:47.110]  skeptical, but they know what they're talking about and it actually does make a really big
[01:26:47.110 --> 01:26:53.030]  difference. So I would bristle at a mixing tobacco into a spliff. I mean, that's just not me. That
[01:26:53.030 --> 01:26:56.630]  said, if that's how people like to smoke, then that's how people like to smoke, like whatever.
[01:26:57.190 --> 01:27:00.630]  The Proper Doinks guys know what they're doing. And some of those glass tip joints are pretty,
[01:27:00.630 --> 01:27:05.750]  pretty cool these days. I'm into it. I love that if they're actually getting into the airflow
[01:27:05.750 --> 01:27:11.510]  engineering of smokables, because me and my peeps have been nerding out on that like unofficially
[01:27:11.510 --> 01:27:15.030]  for so long, where it's like, there's words that we don't know how to describe what we're saying,
[01:27:15.030 --> 01:27:18.390]  but we're always trying to talk about like what makes it burn better, where there has to be a
[01:27:18.390 --> 01:27:23.190]  little more airflow and less. And if those guys are actually like crunching that out, that's so
[01:27:23.190 --> 01:27:28.310]  intriguing. Oh yeah. No, they're like, they're like super scientific about it. And it's,
[01:27:29.030 --> 01:27:32.150]  and they're also like obsessed with the flavor. It's, it's, it's really,
[01:27:32.150 --> 01:27:36.550]  really involved. You should check it out. Proper Doinks. Joint engineering. I love that.
[01:27:39.110 --> 01:27:42.470]  I can't believe that's a real thing now. Like my younger self wouldn't believe that.
[01:27:44.550 --> 01:27:51.830]  I'm trying to get a link to the discord before we, where the heck is that?
[01:27:54.150 --> 01:27:59.350]  Do you guys offer through just dispensers too? Like do you guys have a distributor where it's
[01:27:59.350 --> 01:28:04.390]  like, you know, if you wanted to go to a, there's one in Pacifica, I think Lyft,
[01:28:04.950 --> 01:28:09.350]  maybe they usually carry cuts and stuff. Is that how people can get your action too? Or is it
[01:28:09.350 --> 01:28:14.390]  usually just gardens or, you know what I'm going to, I'm going to plug our, one of our,
[01:28:15.510 --> 01:28:20.950]  our beloved salespeople, Matias and Hey Matias. Hey, could you come here?
[01:28:21.590 --> 01:28:27.350]  You're on the podcast now. People are asking where they can get compound genetic seeds
[01:28:27.910 --> 01:28:32.150]  or, or clones flower, all of the above. Can we talk, can we give them some,
[01:28:33.510 --> 01:28:37.350]  talk about where people can source compound genetics and node labs gear.
[01:28:40.950 --> 01:28:46.870]  What's up everybody. Hope everyone's having a great day. Matias Newton. Pleasure.
[01:28:46.870 --> 01:28:48.710]  Nice to meet you Matias. Travis.
[01:28:48.710 --> 01:28:54.550]  Likewise, Travis. Pleasure to meet you man. Yeah. The best place I would say to get that
[01:28:54.550 --> 01:29:00.870]  list would be on our discord page. Compound has a verified vendors list. It's a sub channel that
[01:29:00.870 --> 01:29:10.150]  we have on our discord page. Can we throw a link in the comments here or. Yes. I'm not the
[01:29:10.150 --> 01:29:15.030]  most technically equipped to do that, but I know we can. I think if you pull it up on your screen
[01:29:15.030 --> 01:29:21.110]  and then just kind of share it under the present on the bottom, I think we can do it that way.
[01:29:21.110 --> 01:29:25.110]  Cool. Awesome. Are you, are you guys usually in like different stores in the Bay or like
[01:29:25.110 --> 01:29:28.790]  surrounding areas though? Like, is it kind of accessible to get your guys stuff if people
[01:29:28.790 --> 01:29:34.150]  are interested? Yeah. Yeah. So on that list there's stores in California that hold our,
[01:29:34.150 --> 01:29:41.910]  hold our, hold our beans. You can go there. Our online stores is being renovated. So typically
[01:29:41.910 --> 01:29:46.550]  you can go to our, our website and you can get directed to buy seeds there as well. But
[01:29:46.550 --> 01:29:50.630]  that's down for the next couple of weeks being kind of renovated. So discord is kind of the
[01:29:50.630 --> 01:29:57.750]  best place to source it at the moment. And yeah, thanks Chris. And then any basically online
[01:29:59.670 --> 01:30:03.830]  we can draw a bunch of seed banks that are, that are carrying our gear stuff from grape gas
[01:30:03.830 --> 01:30:10.710]  collection to all the way to the newest stuff, the grape gas that we just brought out. So that's,
[01:30:10.710 --> 01:30:14.870]  that's the best place. You could get lucky with some retailers across state. There's probably like
[01:30:14.870 --> 01:30:19.830]  five or six that might be holding inventory. That's from Northern Southern California.
[01:30:20.790 --> 01:30:28.390]  So awesome. Yeah. I saw someone on here ask if you wanted to touch on a mono terps and sesquiterp.
[01:30:29.350 --> 01:30:32.710]  Let me pass it back to Chris. Pardon me. I'm not sure if that's in your wheelhouse. Okay,
[01:30:32.710 --> 01:30:36.230]  cool. Yeah. That's, that's a science, more of a science question. I could, I could touch on it,
[01:30:36.230 --> 01:30:40.550]  but I'm not going to give you the best information. Right on. Take care, everybody. Peace.
[01:30:44.150 --> 01:30:49.430]  Hello. Travis, could you let me know how to do a comment here? Can you help me out with that?
[01:30:49.430 --> 01:30:54.630]  So if you go down to the bottom, is there a post a comment section on the right?
[01:31:02.480 --> 01:31:08.800]  If not, I think I can. Hopefully Chris comes back, but I'll hang loose for a minute.
[01:31:09.760 --> 01:31:12.960]  It's been a groovy conversation. Super stoked.
[01:31:17.600 --> 01:31:21.360]  Okay. So you see down on the bottom how there's the present button?
[01:31:24.240 --> 01:31:28.080]  Yes. So if you open up another window, another tab,
[01:31:28.880 --> 01:31:33.280]  then it's pretty easy to share on there. If you wanted to post a comment into the,
[01:31:34.160 --> 01:31:38.080]  the, the chat, you can just read it off to me and I think I'm allowed to put links there. I
[01:31:38.240 --> 01:31:42.960]  think you have to be verified to leave a link. Okay. I just, I just put it in the private chat.
[01:31:43.760 --> 01:31:51.440]  Okay, cool. That'll work. And yeah, what's up with the discord? Tell us what's cool there. What's,
[01:31:51.440 --> 01:31:56.160]  what's going on. So we have like a lot of updated information in all of our seed lines.
[01:31:56.160 --> 01:32:01.120]  Like I said, I do like a monthly AMA to talk about what we're breeding, what we're working on and
[01:32:01.120 --> 01:32:07.680]  stuff. We have, you know, we have different, like, you know, it's just a whole community and you can
[01:32:07.680 --> 01:32:13.520]  also put your, you can ask about grow styles. You can ask about, you can get like support on
[01:32:13.520 --> 01:32:18.640]  being like, how do I grow this right? Or you can get support from me as well as the rest of our
[01:32:18.640 --> 01:32:24.400]  team on like grow tips, pheno hunting, just, just, Hey, I like my plants don't look right. Like help
[01:32:24.400 --> 01:32:28.720]  or like, what's this insect. It's like any, anything, all of the above and learn about,
[01:32:28.720 --> 01:32:33.360]  and then be the first to learn about our new seed drops, clone drops, all the events and
[01:32:33.360 --> 01:32:39.200]  everything like that. Awesome. I think we got it up there. So people are interested. They can just
[01:32:39.200 --> 01:32:47.540]  click and check it out. Killer. Cool. But that you have anything else to touch on Chris? Anything
[01:32:47.540 --> 01:32:52.420]  interesting? Oh, someone did ask if you want to go down some of this rabbit hole, they wanted you to
[01:32:52.420 --> 01:32:56.660]  describe the difference between monoturps and sesquiturps. I think we were kind of loose
[01:32:56.660 --> 01:33:01.540]  on that between the blunt and like other different things, but someone seemed interested in that. If
[01:33:01.540 --> 01:33:09.220]  you wanted to touch on it. Oh boy. It's okay. It's well, I can touch on it, but it's, it's more,
[01:33:09.220 --> 01:33:15.780]  it's, it's like it's, it's a chemistry question. That's it's I don't think it's actually that
[01:33:16.660 --> 01:33:25.060]  impactful as far as like how it's how your body's taking it in. I think it's a chemical structure
[01:33:25.060 --> 01:33:31.380]  thing and how, and how they're built together. So I'm not sure if it's that relevant. You know,
[01:33:31.380 --> 01:33:36.660]  it's, it's essentially I just Googled it two seconds ago. Monoturps are two isoprene units.
[01:33:36.660 --> 01:33:41.220]  Sequiturps are three. So essentially just structuring of the, of the turpines and the
[01:33:41.220 --> 01:33:46.020]  different categorization on those. Yeah. And I think for general layman's like one's a little
[01:33:46.020 --> 01:33:51.060]  more volatile, one sticks around a little longer. They probably play together pretty well most of
[01:33:51.140 --> 01:33:57.860]  the time. But like we said in, in touch time before you know, all these flavonoids and all
[01:33:57.860 --> 01:34:02.580]  these different things are actually, well, the turpines are kind of like the base layer of that,
[01:34:02.580 --> 01:34:07.700]  but all those are really the, what gives you those distinct flavor and aroma experiences.
[01:34:07.700 --> 01:34:13.220]  Oh my God, raspberry. It's like a terpene can not tell you that. And it's probably really distinct
[01:34:14.180 --> 01:34:17.700]  you know, esters and things like that, that are presenting those, those flavors.
[01:34:18.180 --> 01:34:24.260]  And then thials too. The other fascinating thing, I mean, here's something about sensory
[01:34:26.660 --> 01:34:32.020]  science in your brain, which is that your brain and your nose aren't like equal opportunity when
[01:34:32.020 --> 01:34:36.420]  it comes to aromas. You, it doesn't, you don't say like, oh, like 50 parts per million, like a
[01:34:36.420 --> 01:34:41.620]  hundred parts per million. Your nose can favor things that are extremely difficult to detect
[01:34:41.620 --> 01:34:46.980]  with science and be an overwhelming scent to your brain. And it's not like, oh,
[01:34:46.980 --> 01:34:51.220]  I'm going to, I'm going to be able to detect what is going on in your brain
[01:34:51.220 --> 01:34:59.540]  without actually being in high concentrations. So those thials that are, those thials that are
[01:34:59.540 --> 01:35:03.460]  highly, you know, that are like the gas turps and everything like that, I think that, gosh,
[01:35:03.460 --> 01:35:08.740]  I don't know these off the top of my head, but the concentrations are tiny to present a really
[01:35:08.740 --> 01:35:16.820]  intense aroma experience. 0.3 to make your neck jerk. Yeah. Yeah, exactly. And it,
[01:35:16.820 --> 01:35:20.500]  like even just like, uh, what is it like hydrogen sulfide is something like that.
[01:35:20.500 --> 01:35:25.360]  It's a foul smell that your nose can detect because it's so toxic too.
[01:35:25.440 --> 01:35:30.060]  So you got to think your nose is actually evolved to detect things for survival.
[01:35:30.400 --> 01:35:34.140]  Um, and one of them is, uh, food that has gone bad.
[01:35:34.140 --> 01:35:35.080]  That's going to get you sick.
[01:35:35.380 --> 01:35:38.800]  You can smell it of rich, much like those things tend to
[01:35:38.960 --> 01:35:41.440]  register multiplier from what you're saying.
[01:35:41.440 --> 01:35:41.800]  Almost.
[01:35:41.800 --> 01:35:46.260]  That's very interesting where some stuff, our brain is trained to intensify,
[01:35:46.920 --> 01:35:47.260]  right.
[01:35:47.460 --> 01:35:48.300]  That's very interesting.
[01:35:48.300 --> 01:35:49.640]  So it's like psychometric.
[01:35:49.640 --> 01:35:51.020]  So it's not really fair.
[01:35:51.400 --> 01:35:54.180]  And, uh, and there's some things we just can't smell.
[01:35:54.560 --> 01:35:57.780]  Like water is odorless to us.
[01:35:58.360 --> 01:36:01.640]  Other animals can smell water and there's distinct smell of water.
[01:36:02.100 --> 01:36:06.740]  So the way our nose interpret stuff is not necessarily fair or equal.
[01:36:07.080 --> 01:36:10.520]  It's highly based on, you know, what we've evolved to have a little
[01:36:10.520 --> 01:36:14.200]  slot for that says ding and then makes, makes an experience for us.
[01:36:14.440 --> 01:36:14.940]  Okay.
[01:36:14.940 --> 01:36:20.950]  I'm seeing, I'm seeing some, I'm seeing some, okay.
[01:36:20.950 --> 01:36:24.310]  I see genetic memory who seems to really know his shit about, um,
[01:36:24.650 --> 01:36:29.710]  turpines get some corrections on a, on a mono and sesquiterpines
[01:36:29.710 --> 01:36:31.150]  that monos are more volatile.
[01:36:31.770 --> 01:36:34.250]  So maybe those monos are more, uh, you know, we're talking about the
[01:36:34.250 --> 01:36:36.410]  ones that, uh, go away more easily.
[01:36:36.410 --> 01:36:38.110]  So this is really interesting information.
[01:36:38.410 --> 01:36:45.090]  Um, but, uh, yeah, I want to say like, I love that in these type of experience.
[01:36:45.090 --> 01:36:49.070]  I love the chats because like nobody, you know, nobody knows everything.
[01:36:49.130 --> 01:36:55.610]  And, uh, I highly welcome any corrections or new information or people, uh, have,
[01:36:55.670 --> 01:36:59.510]  uh, you know, backgrounds or experiences that otherwise, uh, there's a lot
[01:36:59.510 --> 01:37:00.910]  to discover in this plant still.
[01:37:00.910 --> 01:37:04.750]  So, uh, pretending like it's all figured out is we're not even close.
[01:37:04.910 --> 01:37:05.410]  Not close.
[01:37:06.030 --> 01:37:06.710]  That's what I was saying.
[01:37:06.710 --> 01:37:10.590]  Like look in us in the present, but from a past point of view in the future,
[01:37:10.590 --> 01:37:12.230]  like we're really at the infancy.
[01:37:12.230 --> 01:37:13.230]  It's so fun.
[01:37:13.230 --> 01:37:14.010]  Like I love it.
[01:37:14.010 --> 01:37:16.050]  Like it's a, it's a great place to be.
[01:37:16.050 --> 01:37:19.890]  If you love cannabis, you know, like in cannabis history, like, I feel like
[01:37:19.890 --> 01:37:23.290]  they'll look back at this time and be like, man, they were swinging for the fences.
[01:37:25.810 --> 01:37:26.310]  Totally.
[01:37:26.310 --> 01:37:29.210]  I mean, we, I mean, here's a, here's a interesting thing though.
[01:37:29.210 --> 01:37:34.810]  Like, uh, again, the evolutionary bio biology background comes a lot.
[01:37:34.890 --> 01:37:39.210]  Like when I'm in my perspective here during prohibition, what you had is
[01:37:39.210 --> 01:37:43.210]  like the same thing as like everyone on an island, like, you know, like
[01:37:43.550 --> 01:37:49.710]  everyone's tent grows and, and warehouse backyards and, you know, uh, sunset
[01:37:49.710 --> 01:37:54.190]  district of, of San Francisco garages were like a little island and they
[01:37:54.190 --> 01:37:55.990]  were breeding in that little island.
[01:37:55.990 --> 01:37:58.930]  There was limited amount of ability to exchange cuts.
[01:37:59.770 --> 01:38:03.030]  I mean, now with like, I mean, lemon cherry gelato and stuff like that.
[01:38:03.030 --> 01:38:06.150]  Like it's really, it's homogenizing fast guys.
[01:38:06.150 --> 01:38:10.350]  Like a lot of this diversity is getting bottlenecked really, really hard.
[01:38:10.890 --> 01:38:14.190]  Um, it's really important that a lot of people in this game who really love,
[01:38:14.910 --> 01:38:20.130]  um, new, you know, flavors, classic flavors and new stuff, like keep it
[01:38:20.130 --> 01:38:22.030]  around and we can't lose that diversity.
[01:38:22.030 --> 01:38:25.930]  So I think, I do think the way things are going, the prompt, the, the
[01:38:25.930 --> 01:38:32.050]  Nervant, like the, the, the golden age was probably, probably like 10 to 15
[01:38:32.050 --> 01:38:35.210]  years ago, maybe, um, maybe, maybe even five years ago.
[01:38:35.210 --> 01:38:38.890]  And I think we're starting towards a little bit of a homogenization of flavors
[01:38:39.430 --> 01:38:43.030]  just by the, by the way that, um, these big markets in a lot of
[01:38:43.030 --> 01:38:44.510]  the legalization, it's just how it is.
[01:38:45.030 --> 01:38:46.830]  I see a small scale rebellion.
[01:38:46.830 --> 01:38:50.710]  At least I hear a lot of narrative of green bud, which just sounds funny to
[01:38:50.710 --> 01:38:54.030]  me, because that's such an old school term or like green wheat, green bud
[01:38:54.030 --> 01:38:54.870]  is like what people want.
[01:38:54.870 --> 01:38:56.330]  They don't even care about the strain.
[01:38:56.330 --> 01:38:57.630]  As long as it's not purple.
[01:38:57.950 --> 01:38:59.110]  It's like, I don't know.
[01:38:59.110 --> 01:39:02.710]  I see at least a mini rebellion, maybe not on the big scale, but like.
[01:39:03.310 --> 01:39:07.550]  I think people are really searching out the ones that worked, you know, and it
[01:39:07.570 --> 01:39:11.170]  might not be in the California necessarily, the California market necessarily, but I
[01:39:11.170 --> 01:39:15.050]  think even ones that are going to test low, we're going to start being like more
[01:39:15.050 --> 01:39:19.010]  demanded just because of the effects and the flavor more than the number as people
[01:39:19.010 --> 01:39:23.170]  smoke enough, like the numbers can impress them less and less than the experience.
[01:39:23.170 --> 01:39:23.770]  So.
[01:39:25.130 --> 01:39:25.510]  I don't know.
[01:39:25.510 --> 01:39:29.650]  I speculate at least some, some sort of a rebellion in 2023 for green bud.
[01:39:30.730 --> 01:39:31.530]  I agree.
[01:39:31.530 --> 01:39:34.210]  I mean, I think green roads coming back and that's, that's what I'm talking
[01:39:34.210 --> 01:39:39.310]  about with those chems too, is like, I want the piney sour chems and I don't
[01:39:39.310 --> 01:39:40.330]  give a shit if it's green.
[01:39:40.630 --> 01:39:43.630]  Um, I want that smoke experience, which I really kind of miss.
[01:39:44.190 --> 01:39:48.350]  Um, I'm seeing a, I have to answer this question from Peter here, which is, uh,
[01:39:48.590 --> 01:39:49.710]  how's the weed at UVM?
[01:39:49.750 --> 01:39:50.250]  Dank.
[01:39:51.710 --> 01:39:52.210]  Dank.
[01:39:52.470 --> 01:39:52.970]  It was great.
[01:39:52.990 --> 01:39:56.670]  Um, and that's like where, I mean, Boston growing up in Boston and, uh, going to
[01:39:56.670 --> 01:39:58.870]  UVM is like sour diesel was king.
[01:39:59.150 --> 01:40:03.550]  Um, and if you can get the right bag of sour diesel, it's just like, that's
[01:40:03.570 --> 01:40:05.090]  really the only thing people want.
[01:40:05.130 --> 01:40:08.050]  So that East coast sour diesel was really where it's at.
[01:40:08.130 --> 01:40:11.410]  And, uh, other than that, you might just get some other, like, sort of like
[01:40:11.410 --> 01:40:14.710]  classics, I feel like people who bought seeds from some of the Dutch guys, like
[01:40:15.050 --> 01:40:21.610]  white widow or, uh, um, uh, you know, um, what others like train wreck and
[01:40:21.610 --> 01:40:25.250]  white widow and GG for stuff like that was like really big, um, or like even
[01:40:25.250 --> 01:40:27.610]  like sensey crosses and shit like that.
[01:40:27.730 --> 01:40:29.250]  Um, anyway.
[01:40:30.050 --> 01:40:30.330]  Yeah.
[01:40:30.350 --> 01:40:31.670]  I love Vermont.
[01:40:31.670 --> 01:40:34.170]  And if there's any Vermonters in here, then we'd love you.
[01:40:34.350 --> 01:40:36.470]  Green mountain boys for the win.
[01:40:38.150 --> 01:40:38.870]  Go catamounts.
[01:40:41.270 --> 01:40:42.470]  That's Montpelier, right?
[01:40:43.430 --> 01:40:44.830]  Burlington Burlington.
[01:40:44.870 --> 01:40:45.370]  Okay.
[01:40:47.750 --> 01:40:48.250]  It's cool.
[01:40:49.190 --> 01:40:52.750]  Yeah, it was on Cesar Chavez for a stretch in the city and, uh, we were
[01:40:52.750 --> 01:40:55.390]  doing our thing at Cesar Chavez and mission pretty much.
[01:40:55.390 --> 01:40:57.870]  It was, it was, it was interesting.
[01:40:57.950 --> 01:40:58.510]  It was great.
[01:41:04.060 --> 01:41:05.700]  So many fun genetics back then.
[01:41:05.700 --> 01:41:10.540]  I just found a big list of what, like the Bay had to offer in 2005 for genetics.
[01:41:10.540 --> 01:41:11.700]  It's so interesting.
[01:41:11.700 --> 01:41:16.300]  Like there's still some land race stuff on there, like Masari Sharif and like
[01:41:16.300 --> 01:41:18.420]  the Cali O and stuff like that.
[01:41:18.420 --> 01:41:24.300]  And like the new ones were like, you know, bubble gum crosses or like train
[01:41:24.300 --> 01:41:27.820]  wreck was like the hard to get one, you know, like just, it's just
[01:41:27.820 --> 01:41:29.660]  really interesting, uh, throwback.
[01:41:30.420 --> 01:41:33.820]  You know, uh, I want to do another, uh, where you talk, jumping back
[01:41:33.840 --> 01:41:35.680]  to solventless hash really quick.
[01:41:35.920 --> 01:41:39.560]  Do another shameless plug of the, uh, the grape gas line we made.
[01:41:39.880 --> 01:41:41.040]  I'm trying to center this.
[01:41:41.040 --> 01:41:41.920]  You can see behind me.
[01:41:42.440 --> 01:41:46.720]  Um, we absolutely love everything from that seed line and it's kind of like
[01:41:46.720 --> 01:41:48.920]  becoming sort of legendary at this point, I think.
[01:41:49.400 --> 01:41:52.360]  Um, but, uh, the grape gas S one.
[01:41:52.680 --> 01:41:56.440]  Um, if you can get your hands on any solventless hash from
[01:41:56.440 --> 01:41:57.880]  that, it's like mind blowing.
[01:41:58.360 --> 01:42:02.280]  And the first year and a half of people running that cut, it's a pretty fast
[01:42:02.280 --> 01:42:04.380]  finishing cut, didn't really test well.
[01:42:04.380 --> 01:42:09.340]  Then people started to harvest because solventless hash, uh, efficiency is
[01:42:09.340 --> 01:42:10.980]  dramatically affected by harvest date.
[01:42:11.640 --> 01:42:17.660]  So you can have like a bell curve of if it's a nine week strain, if you put it
[01:42:17.680 --> 01:42:20.740]  all the way in nine weeks, it's going to be like, eh, and if you harvest it just
[01:42:20.740 --> 01:42:23.520]  the right day at seven and a half or eight weeks or eight and a half weeks,
[01:42:23.520 --> 01:42:25.900]  something like that, it could be like super efficient.
[01:42:25.900 --> 01:42:26.220]  Right.
[01:42:26.480 --> 01:42:32.320]  So I think a couple of influential solventless hash makers, um, uh,
[01:42:32.760 --> 01:42:35.600]  started to run that cut and like, guys, if you can get your hands on it, the
[01:42:35.600 --> 01:42:40.440]  grape, like sweet dime a tappy artificial grape, like grape lollipop.
[01:42:40.480 --> 01:42:41.440]  It's profound.
[01:42:41.440 --> 01:42:45.440]  It's really, really something that's extremely, extremely distinct strain
[01:42:45.440 --> 01:42:49.500]  in the, and anything from the grape gas line is pretty dominant with that turf.
[01:42:49.500 --> 01:42:51.360]  But, uh, I absolutely love that.
[01:42:51.360 --> 01:42:55.200]  And if you ever have a bag of grape gas, I'm going to be like, let's, let's, let's
[01:42:55.200 --> 01:42:55.560]  hit that.
[01:42:56.640 --> 01:42:56.880]  Yeah.
[01:42:57.480 --> 01:42:59.720]  How's the dump on the, uh, that one?
[01:42:59.720 --> 01:43:03.360]  Is it just special enough for the flavor and effect or does the, does
[01:43:03.360 --> 01:43:04.280]  yield come along with it?
[01:43:04.280 --> 01:43:06.560]  Well, is it respectable at least, or is it more like a kind of
[01:43:06.560 --> 01:43:07.680]  sort of like headstache one?
[01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:16.040]  Um, yeah, I mean, uh, I think it's more about how I think it's become more
[01:43:16.040 --> 01:43:16.960]  efficient as people.
[01:43:16.960 --> 01:43:19.340]  So that's why I mentioned it as people have figured out the timing.
[01:43:19.400 --> 01:43:20.400]  I think it's become efficient.
[01:43:21.640 --> 01:43:23.640]  Our initial runs were like super inefficient.
[01:43:23.640 --> 01:43:24.440]  We're like, ah, shit.
[01:43:24.440 --> 01:43:27.480]  So, um, you know, I do, yeah, it is.
[01:43:27.560 --> 01:43:31.200]  Um, I think it is becoming a staple for a couple, uh, for a couple of
[01:43:31.200 --> 01:43:35.600]  salt and the sash makers that, uh, um, just, uh, go, you know, Google it, you
[01:43:35.600 --> 01:43:41.280]  know, go, go on Instagram, dig around and, uh, and, uh, if you find it, get it.
[01:43:42.400 --> 01:43:45.840]  I feel like that's an interesting metric that isn't really standardized either.
[01:43:45.840 --> 01:43:51.920]  I feel like from my point of view, it's like grams of frozen biomass per amount
[01:43:51.960 --> 01:43:54.080]  of space per time.
[01:43:54.680 --> 01:43:58.640]  And then with the variable of cost of inputs, you know, whether it be like
[01:43:58.640 --> 01:44:03.320]  housing, the plants, labor and power and all that, I feel like that touches all
[01:44:03.320 --> 01:44:07.040]  the variables, but I feel like there's so many ways that people describe.
[01:44:07.880 --> 01:44:09.160]  How solventless yields.
[01:44:09.160 --> 01:44:11.320]  I'd love to see like how you guys talk about it.
[01:44:12.600 --> 01:44:13.720]  Cause that's a variable.
[01:44:13.720 --> 01:44:16.680]  Like I was, like I was just saying in my equation, at least if you can get enough
[01:44:16.680 --> 01:44:20.040]  biomass per square feet and then time goes way down, it doesn't have to yield
[01:44:21.040 --> 01:44:23.160]  like it works on the year.
[01:44:23.200 --> 01:44:23.600]  No.
[01:44:23.880 --> 01:44:27.680]  Well, and the, and the big thing these days in the, in the game
[01:44:27.680 --> 01:44:29.000]  too, is like a buds, right?
[01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:33.280]  Like you can have a strain that has a lot of B buds, like little
[01:44:33.280 --> 01:44:34.880]  small buds or something like that.
[01:44:34.880 --> 01:44:36.560]  And if you're washing, it just doesn't matter.
[01:44:36.560 --> 01:44:36.840]  Right.
[01:44:37.160 --> 01:44:38.640]  Same thing too, with big buds.
[01:44:38.640 --> 01:44:41.960]  The other thing is you can have a bug that, but that's too big.
[01:44:42.360 --> 01:44:47.160]  If you're a brand that sells eighth jars, like buds that are like that, like you
[01:44:47.160 --> 01:44:49.560]  have to like saw them in half and then you have these like weird shape buds.
[01:44:49.600 --> 01:44:50.400]  And that doesn't work.
[01:44:50.440 --> 01:44:52.840]  Everyone wants the perfect like size.
[01:44:52.840 --> 01:44:53.120]  Right.
[01:44:53.600 --> 01:44:57.840]  So big buds as well are grapple pie cut, which is grape gas by apple fritter.
[01:44:58.280 --> 01:45:00.800]  Um, washes it like 4%.
[01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:04.320]  And it's like huge, like they're freaking huge, massive spears.
[01:45:04.320 --> 01:45:08.360]  So that's another one that's the yield's huge because of the plants, huge,
[01:45:08.640 --> 01:45:10.000]  not necessarily the efficiency.
[01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:15.120]  So, um, yeah, that is an interesting, uh, subject that travels.
[01:45:15.120 --> 01:45:17.600]  You could probably, we could probably go on another two hours, which is
[01:45:17.600 --> 01:45:19.240]  called resource use efficiency.
[01:45:19.600 --> 01:45:24.880]  Which, uh, Takoshi Kozai, um, so Yoshi Kozai, excuse me, um, of the
[01:45:24.880 --> 01:45:28.120]  university of Chiba, Japan, uh, pioneered.
[01:45:28.440 --> 01:45:31.000]  And if you want to get into, if you want to get into that, just Google
[01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:36.600]  to Yoshi Kozai, um, he has a really, uh, he used like mathematical equations
[01:45:36.600 --> 01:45:39.680]  to like, to run vertical farming.
[01:45:39.680 --> 01:45:43.440]  And, and, uh, he he's part of the group of people who make like.
[01:45:44.120 --> 01:45:45.600]  The special strawberries.
[01:45:45.600 --> 01:45:49.200]  I've never heard of you heard these like 50, $75 strawberries and stuff, but like,
[01:45:49.360 --> 01:45:51.880]  no, they're really, really interesting.
[01:45:51.880 --> 01:45:55.160]  Um, Sherry Kubota of the university of Ohio as well is extremely
[01:45:55.160 --> 01:45:59.120]  influential from that, but, uh, yeah, if you're into that sort of stuff,
[01:45:59.120 --> 01:46:01.120]  they like measure resource use efficiency.
[01:46:01.560 --> 01:46:03.600]  That's something I'm trying, really trying to get into.
[01:46:03.600 --> 01:46:08.320]  And, uh, it's extremely complex and I, when it opens up, I want to go over there.
[01:46:08.400 --> 01:46:10.280]  So anyway, really interesting.
[01:46:10.800 --> 01:46:10.920]  Yeah.
[01:46:10.920 --> 01:46:11.520]  That'd be awesome.
[01:46:11.520 --> 01:46:15.320]  It seems so many nuances and intermoving parts where it's like, yeah, that'd be
[01:46:15.320 --> 01:46:18.560]  an interesting read to see someone who's like thought about it for a while.
[01:46:19.200 --> 01:46:19.560]  Definitely.
[01:46:19.560 --> 01:46:19.960]  Definitely.
[01:46:20.480 --> 01:46:20.880]  Cool.
[01:46:22.160 --> 01:46:22.760]  What do you think?
[01:46:22.760 --> 01:46:25.280]  Did you see any more interesting questions or comments or should
[01:46:25.280 --> 01:46:26.520]  we wrap it up for the evening?
[01:46:29.770 --> 01:46:36.290]  Regular, uh, reading through here, a couple of comments, something about
[01:46:36.290 --> 01:46:39.330]  seizures, but I don't know, I think it's to us, okay, it's someone else.
[01:46:40.410 --> 01:46:42.170]  Um, Georgia pie is a great cut.
[01:46:42.450 --> 01:46:43.690]  Wonderful, wonderful cut.
[01:46:44.530 --> 01:46:49.540]  Uh, I don't know if I can change the string list.
[01:46:49.700 --> 01:46:52.100]  Um, we'll be updating our website really soon, Andre.
[01:46:52.100 --> 01:46:54.900]  So just stay, stay tuned and you can check out the whole list.
[01:46:55.700 --> 01:47:01.220]  Um, but, uh, you know, uh, I will, I will, uh, uh, you know, I will, uh, take us,
[01:47:02.060 --> 01:47:04.860]  um, again, a grape gap.
[01:47:04.860 --> 01:47:07.140]  If you want to get the grape gas line, just stay on with the
[01:47:07.140 --> 01:47:08.740]  website and log onto the discord.
[01:47:08.740 --> 01:47:10.820]  We're going to be doing a re-release of some of those and a re-up
[01:47:10.820 --> 01:47:11.620]  of some of those very soon.
[01:47:12.060 --> 01:47:12.820]  Great gas line.
[01:47:13.020 --> 01:47:18.780]  Um, and then, uh, you know, the node labs library, it's pretty cool.
[01:47:18.780 --> 01:47:23.380]  Um, you know, we have like 261 verified clone lines in vitro.
[01:47:23.900 --> 01:47:29.180]  Um, we're one of the biggest, um, you know, in vitro clone libraries in the world.
[01:47:29.860 --> 01:47:33.860]  And, uh, the cool thing about that list is that it's not like it's a curated list.
[01:47:33.860 --> 01:47:39.700]  Like if we have a cut and we have, you know, 10 OGs, if some OG is just like
[01:47:39.700 --> 01:47:42.140]  another OG, but this one performs better, we're just like, okay, we don't need that.
[01:47:42.660 --> 01:47:47.700]  Um, that, that 200, you know, that 261 strains are like the best of the
[01:47:47.700 --> 01:47:49.460]  best in their own category.
[01:47:49.620 --> 01:47:52.420]  And that's where we're really trying to be like germplasm storage, like a
[01:47:52.500 --> 01:47:56.580]  repository to have a representative from every type of terp, from every type of
[01:47:56.580 --> 01:48:00.900]  experience, from every type of plant, for every type of grower, um, it's just super
[01:48:00.900 --> 01:48:01.380]  exciting.
[01:48:01.380 --> 01:48:05.180]  And I, I nerd out about like looking at that list and we're really excited about
[01:48:05.180 --> 01:48:06.860]  what we can do with that list.
[01:48:06.860 --> 01:48:11.140]  And we want to, you know, we want to continue interface with a interface with
[01:48:11.140 --> 01:48:15.660]  commercial growers and consumers and hobbyists, um, you know, at every level.
[01:48:15.660 --> 01:48:19.940]  So really appreciate you guys and really appreciate you, uh, Travis for having me
[01:48:19.940 --> 01:48:20.300]  on today.
[01:48:20.300 --> 01:48:21.020]  So thank you so much.
[01:48:21.540 --> 01:48:25.340]  The pleasure, Chris, are you actively looking to get the cam on that list as
[01:48:25.340 --> 01:48:25.580]  well?
[01:48:25.580 --> 01:48:27.700]  It sounds like I'm hoping I'm rooting for you.
[01:48:27.700 --> 01:48:30.220]  If that's like one, that's a draft pick for the list.
[01:48:30.540 --> 01:48:32.500]  We have multiple, we have multiple cams.
[01:48:32.580 --> 01:48:36.060]  One I'm excited about is vapor fuel, which we actually hunted from a Vermont,
[01:48:36.420 --> 01:48:39.020]  Vermont greenery, little shout out to them.
[01:48:39.420 --> 01:48:42.140]  Um, but vapor fuel was some vapor fuel BX.
[01:48:42.140 --> 01:48:45.340]  So vapor fuel was part of our, uh, shit.
[01:48:45.580 --> 01:48:47.420]  I think it's part of our mental line.
[01:48:47.540 --> 01:48:49.820]  Um, gosh, I'm blanking on that.
[01:48:50.100 --> 01:48:57.020]  Uh, uh, but it was, uh, chem I 95, I believe by, uh, jet fuel gelato mental.
[01:48:57.020 --> 01:48:57.260]  Fuck.
[01:48:57.260 --> 01:48:59.980]  I gotta, I gotta go back to that, but, um, we're hunting, we're hunting some of
[01:48:59.980 --> 01:49:00.420]  that stuff.
[01:49:00.420 --> 01:49:01.260]  We're getting some cams.
[01:49:01.260 --> 01:49:02.100]  We're really excited about it.
[01:49:02.660 --> 01:49:03.260]  Amazing.
[01:49:04.580 --> 01:49:05.860]  It's a pleasure to meet you, Chris.
[01:49:05.860 --> 01:49:07.340]  Like, thanks for the time.
[01:49:07.740 --> 01:49:08.660]  Thank you so much.
[01:49:08.860 --> 01:49:11.060]  Compound genetics, check out Daga.
[01:49:11.340 --> 01:49:12.460]  Don't buy nothing from me.
[01:49:12.460 --> 01:49:14.460]  Cause these guys know a lot more than I do.
[01:49:15.900 --> 01:49:16.500]  Cheers guys.
[01:49:16.500 --> 01:49:17.060]  Thanks so much.
[01:49:17.060 --> 01:49:18.100]  Everyone who attended today.
