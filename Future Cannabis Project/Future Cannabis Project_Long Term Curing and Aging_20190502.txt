[00:00.000 --> 00:03.000]  We see the same thing with hashes too, like Nepalese ball hash.
[00:03.000 --> 00:08.500]  If you do a nice Nepalese hash, a temple ball, you're going to get different cannabinoids in there.
[00:08.500 --> 00:14.000]  I know Frenchie Cannoli is talking about, you're seeing terpenoids coming out of Nepalese hash balls
[00:14.000 --> 00:16.000]  that you're not going to see in fresh flower.
[00:16.000 --> 00:21.500]  And you're going to get a little bit of CBN degradation in there, but if you do a nice long slow cure,
[00:21.500 --> 00:25.500]  you get that much rounder whole plant feel.
[00:26.000 --> 00:31.000]  I used to live in the Caribbean for a long time, and we'd notice that almost all the bud that would come out of the Virgin Islands,
[00:31.000 --> 00:33.500]  it would be a golden brown color.
[00:33.500 --> 00:38.000]  And a lot of that's because they don't have indoor spaces to cure, so they're curing in the sun.
[00:38.000 --> 00:41.500]  Because if you're curing in the shade or in the jungle or the bush where you're growing it,
[00:41.500 --> 00:44.000]  you're going to get a lot of rotten mold and things like that.
[00:44.000 --> 00:47.500]  The whole cure concept is amazing in the way the degradation and the color changes.
[00:47.500 --> 00:53.000]  And you see this in dispensaries all the time now, that the stuff that's a little golden or a little amber
[00:53.000 --> 00:58.500]  is just sitting on the shelf while all this bright green neon stuff is flying out the door,
[00:58.500 --> 01:01.500]  and people aren't realizing.
[01:01.500 --> 01:05.500]  Think about cigars. Think about the high-end whiskeys.
[01:05.500 --> 01:12.500]  Think about how you're developing phenols in curing and in transferring tannins.
[01:12.500 --> 01:14.500]  And that's really the crux of the issue.
[01:14.500 --> 01:17.500]  You start changing these chlorophylls all over to tannins.
[01:17.500 --> 01:18.500]  It's amazing.
[01:19.000 --> 01:29.000]  You see all this weed coming out of South Florida that was cured in the traditional tobacco ways with the Spanish cedar.
[01:29.000 --> 01:32.000]  And you see the phenols completely change.
[01:32.000 --> 01:38.000]  The terpene profile, when it goes in after curing in 28 to 30 days in the Spanish cedar,
[01:38.000 --> 01:44.000]  it just completely changes everything, especially all the hazes and the more rootsy, spicy strains
[01:44.000 --> 01:47.000]  really just develop in that environment.
[01:47.000 --> 01:52.500]  The tobacco model, there's a cigar now that's, I think it's like $10,000 for the box of these cigars,
[01:52.500 --> 01:57.500]  but it's 15-year-old tobacco that they've been aging in these special humidors.
[01:57.500 --> 02:00.500]  And with tobacco, it requires a much higher humidity content.
[02:00.500 --> 02:04.500]  They want to be in a room with like a 70% relative humidity to keep it right.
[02:04.500 --> 02:08.500]  And with cannabis, especially in curing, we want to keep it down around in the 50 range.
[02:08.500 --> 02:12.500]  You don't want to have too much moisture in there because you can get pathogens,
[02:12.500 --> 02:16.500]  and in the curing process, you have to worry about aspergillus and other things like that.
[02:16.500 --> 02:22.000]  You really need to keep your room stable and keep the humidity just perfect
[02:22.000 --> 02:24.000]  and the temperature in a certain range.
[02:24.000 --> 02:29.000]  And you want to keep lots of airflow going through and just take your time with it.
[02:29.000 --> 02:32.000]  It's amazing. People are just in such a rush to get things out the door.
[02:32.000 --> 02:36.500]  And you find that some of our favorite things we have, I'm trying to remember the name of this.
[02:36.500 --> 02:39.000]  What was it, a tanj kush or something? Was it the tanj?
[02:39.000 --> 02:42.000]  We had one that's a three, we've been curing, which one?
[02:42.000 --> 02:45.000]  Yeah, the tanj kush. We've cured it for three years.
[02:45.500 --> 02:51.500]  And it has drastically changed in nose, in flavor, in every single way.
[02:51.500 --> 02:56.500]  And it's just such a happy flower to smoke. It's just like velvet going in.
[02:56.500 --> 03:01.500]  Yeah, it's so funny to me how many of the same concepts that we all have been focusing on
[03:01.500 --> 03:07.500]  and developing for 20 or 30 years for cannabis are so the same processes and concepts
[03:07.500 --> 03:10.500]  executed in different ways for soil building.
[03:10.500 --> 03:13.500]  You talk about these temperature ranges and time.
[03:14.000 --> 03:19.000]  We have to think about those same exact things for composting and for aging our forest products.
[03:19.000 --> 03:23.000]  We use redwood in our soil because we're up in Humboldt.
[03:23.000 --> 03:26.000]  It's a byproduct of existing industry that was being wasted.
[03:26.000 --> 03:34.000]  And so we use it in a very specific way, compost it in a way to build all of the microbiology correctly.
[03:34.000 --> 03:39.000]  It requires intense temperature monitoring where we have to let it hit a certain temperature
[03:39.000 --> 03:42.000]  and roll it and then let it build back up to those temperatures.
[03:42.500 --> 03:44.500]  And you've got to be meticulous. You've got to pay attention.
[03:44.500 --> 03:49.500]  You've got to test. You've got to look at the whole picture.
[03:49.500 --> 03:52.500]  And if you're not paying attention, it's going to get away from you.
[03:52.500 --> 03:55.500]  And that's where the experience comes in for curing.
[03:55.500 --> 04:01.500]  So many people who are new to the industry don't even see the concept as existing.
[04:01.500 --> 04:03.500]  And that's why they can't execute it.
[04:03.500 --> 04:08.500]  And the depth of each of those things with the cannabis, you have all the different cannabinoids.
[04:09.000 --> 04:12.000]  You have the terpenoids. You have every little bit of it that you need all those parts.
[04:12.000 --> 04:15.000]  THC is THC is THC. It's a single note.
[04:15.000 --> 04:19.000]  It's going to affect your CB1 receptors. It's going to trigger that high.
[04:19.000 --> 04:25.000]  And you can get the most refined oil that is 90% THC and that's fine.
[04:25.000 --> 04:29.000]  But in that flower, you're going to bring into maturation all of the other parts of the plant,
[04:29.000 --> 04:33.000]  all the oils and the aromatics and really bringing it into the same thing with the soil.
[04:33.000 --> 04:37.000]  You need the mycorrhizae. You need the beneficials. You need the bacteria.
[04:37.000 --> 04:40.500]  You need every single bit. It's not dirt. Dirt is dead. Soil is alive.
