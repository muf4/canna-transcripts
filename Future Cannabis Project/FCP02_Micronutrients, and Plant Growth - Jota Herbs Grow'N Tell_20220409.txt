You know I've been to CannaCon since 2016 I want to say. Pretty much every
single year and this is the first year since...
I think I heard a little feedback there. Yeah so I've been to CannaCon since like 2016 and this was one of the first years I've gone where I have not done a presentation.
You know typically I'll give a presentation about carbon as a
macronutrient or you know why growers that are looking to increase yield and
improve their quality should focus on carbon delivery to plants. But this year
a little bit different because we went to Oklahoma twice last year for CannaCon
and then we also flew in to see a couple of you know current customers and then
also make some new friends. So this year was a little bit slower than years in
the past so I'm almost kind of you know glad we didn't shell out the 10k for a
Yeah it's interesting because it's a changing landscape from what I've
sound. Yes Peter thank you so much I see we I heard we have sound we are live on
YouTube as well so fantastic glad everybody's on we've got like 37 people
in the chat on YouTube. We've got a good crowd of people here in the room so
let's go ahead and get going and we'll get right back to that conversation but
I figure since we're live we should go ahead and do the intro. So excuse me
welcome welcome welcome to Hota Herbs Grow and Tell. We are here for our
Thursday night cultivation club as we are each week at 9 p.m. Eastern 6 p.m.
Pacific. As always we are produced recorded and simulcast on the Future
Cannabis Project FCPO2 channel. If you are new to the room or new to the
YouTube feed make sure that you click on the clubhouse room and join the club or
subscribe to FCP Future Cannabis Project on YouTube both channels the Future
Cannabis Project and the Future Cannabis FCPO2 channel. I'm gonna make
sure you subscribe to both channels so you don't miss any of the great content
that's being delivered out there every day. There's something new on Future
Cannabis Project. Also check out the Daga Gardens website for seeds and
information and some other great content. So awesome stuff going on out there with
the Future Cannabis Project and all of our friends out there. So thank you
everybody for joining. This is episode 29 and this week we are going to be talking
about micronutrients. We've gone through a good amount of the rest of the pile of
macronutrients so it's probably a good time to get into micronutrients and
since they are all micro we're gonna kind of bunch them all together into a
single evening of fun and discussions. With me back returning our returning
champion Nick. Welcome back sir. Thank you so much for joining. It's good to have
you back. We missed you last week. Excuse me I missed you guys too. You know I
think the conversation around transpiration would have been pretty
nice you know to kind of segue into this and certainly in episodes that
we've done in the past we've talked a little bit about some of these
micronutrients and we've kind of elucidated to their functions a little
bit. So tonight it's gonna be an opportunity for us to kind of unpack
that a little bit and to take a greater look at it in you know more detail. I
think one of the reasons it makes sense for us to consolidate this conversation
on micronutrients you know because with episodes in the past we've done you know
just an entire episode on like phosphorus, potassium, nitrogen, etc etc
well amino acids but the micronutrients can more or less be kind of lumped you
know into the same episode because if you really look at how micronutrients
which we'll name here in a few minutes I'm sure Jason will get into that but if
you look at their spatial distribution in plants it's easy to kind of summarize
certain things you know like boron for instance about 95 ish percent of all of
the boron that a plant takes up is going to be found in the cell walls and
so really when we're talking about boron there's a fairly limited number of
things that we should talk about but I don't want to you know have that be
misconstrued as saying that these micronutrients are not extremely valuable
you know they may have the word micro up front but they also play critical roles
in plant metabolism primary plant metabolism like photosynthesis for
example in nitrate reduction so their roles are critical and if you eliminate
these micronutrients you get some pretty bad effects some pretty devastating
effects to plants they can do anything from you know kill the entire plant or
just affect its integrity this you know the cellular integrity and the structure
of the plant overall so we'll have a chance to kind of look at all that stuff
tonight I think you have the microphone muted there Jason yep absolutely you are
correct sir so I think a great place to get us started this evening is as you
mentioned with an overview of what are the micronutrients and I'm gonna go
ahead and read some information from Jeff Lowenfeld's teaming with nutrients
I think Jeff is a fantastic source and a great place for us to start conversations
so I'm gonna read some stuff from his book and then we'll jump into the
conversation I do have hand-raising turned off we'll turn that back on
towards the end of the room as we always do peels pre excuse me please feel free
if you want to throw your questions into the back chat or throw them up on
YouTube as we go through but you know for the most part we're gonna we've got
a good amount of stuff to get through so let's go ahead and dive in all right so
what are the micronutrients you've got copper iron manganese zinc molybdenum
and nickel and chlorine is also included in Jeff's list of micronutrients and I
know when I read his book I was like chlorine that's something we usually try
to avoid actually and I do spend a lot of time letting water just sit in case
there might be some chlorine in it from the tap water in my water system so I
thought it was interesting that chlorine is included but it is from what he says
in his book which is now a couple years old already is a relative newcomer to
the list of essential nutrients so according to von lid Leibniz law of
minimum even if the least used nutrient is not present it won't do any good to
have all of the others so elements used in trace amounts are every bit as
essential as macronutrients without them plants can't grow and reproduce as Nick
was saying a lot of these components are essential for the other ones to even
work so without them the macronutrients and the other things that you have are
you're not going to get any more carbon so boron will start with boron boron is
a component in the cell walls what where it connects the carbohydrate chains it
is necessary for the formation of pollen tubes and thus pollen doesn't form
without boron boron also plays a role in balancing the amount of sugars versus
starch in the plant and it is involved in translocation of both throughout the
plant I'm gonna I'm not gonna drain his book and read it all so I'm gonna skip
down chlorine as I mentioned chlorine is relatively newcomer to the list of
essential nutrients scientists have discovered that it is a necessary for
the operation of the stomata and in maintaining the electrical balance of
something we talk about all the time is ions chlorine is also needed to break
bonds that are holding water molecules together during photosynthesis it is the
chlorine atoms that supply electrons for that process copper is a key component
in enzymes used in oxidation and the reactions that occur during photosynthesis
and respiration copper is also in enzymes that build amino acids into
proteins and it plays a key role in the synthesis of lignin iron atoms serve as
carriers of electrons and the electrons can easily be passed around between them
as such iron is useful for respiration and oxidation reduction reactions where
electrons are taken from one molecule and given to another iron is also used
to make chlorophyll although it's not part of the molecule it helps it to
function properly iron is critical to nitrogen fixation as the conversation of
atmospheric nitrate nitrogen and nitrates rely on iron it is a component
of important enzymes and proteins in fact iron is so important to plants that
they have developed a system to release ions into the soil to lower the pH to
prevent iron iron from becoming unavailable right that is awesome right
we talk all the time about how the plant is farming the biology but it is even
adjusting the pH of the soil not only to help maintain its health but also to
help ensure that it can get at some of these nutrients which is really really
cool manganese is used to free oxygen during photosynthesis by accepting
electrons from water it also works with certain enzymes to break up
carbohydrates zinc is a component of lots of enzymes and is involved in
donating and accepting electrons oxidation and reduction I can't even
count how many times Nick has said oxidation and reduction in these
conversations over the last 28 29 episodes now zinc helps in the
production of auxins which we know are what's going on with those hormones
above the ground that help create buds the main growth hormones in plants it is
needed to synthesize chlorophyll carbohydrates and it activates enzymes
needed to make some proteins molybdenum which is one that's always fun to say
molybdenum is necessary for the synthesis of organic phosphorus compounds
was phosphorus enters the plant also while not directly related to cellular
nutrition molybdenum is needed in order for rhizobia and frankia bacteria to fix
nitrogen in the root nodules of legumes so again another you know we've covered
a lot of those topics we even talked about rhizosphere two weeks ago nickel
there are many who still don't recognize nickel as an essential nutrient because
its functions are obscure however when nickel is absent nitrogen in the form of
accumulates in the leaves this results in leaf tip burning so again helping
with those real breakdown and release of some of those things that build up
within the plant sodium according to some scientists sodium is not an
essential element because it is not needed for all plants to grow however in
C4 plants which include sugarcane maize and sorghum and amaranth sodium can help
support osmotic activities in the cells drawing water into the cells that are
not enough where there's not enough potassium ions to do the job so all of
these micronutrients have a macro impact on the plants ability to absorb
those other elements and nutrients
next year yeah yeah I mean that was a nice little introduction there's kind of
like a laundry list of things to go through I suppose with you know all the
individual micronutrients and how they might be participating in some of these
reactions but to kind of start off as you know giving a general overview I
would say that a lot of the function of the micronutrients that we're going to
talk about largely it comes down to their ability to hold charges and you
know this is how they participate in photosynthesis for example and then some
of them you know when they're precipitated like for example example in
the cell wall excuse me you may find micronutrients like zinc for instance
being precipitated in the cell walls as a result of toxicity and the plants are
trying to mitigate that stress so there's oftentimes very distinct you
know distinctly narrow ranges between some of these micronutrients and what
might be considered a optimum level versus what's going to be considered a
toxic level and this is certainly one of the things that's true with boron you've
got a very narrow range so oftentimes you know the plants don't need these in
high quantities but you know as you mentioned the OG organic chemist
Justice von Liebig came up with this idea that plant growth is limited by
elements that are least available not most abundant so the theory actually
stands to reason nowadays because you know that if your plants have a nitrogen
deficiency you can add all the phosphorus and all the potassium and so
on and so forth to the plants but you're never going to correct that nitrogen
deficiency directly you know you need to supplement that in order to correct it so
once that deficiency is corrected the rest of the plant growth can happen and
it's basically possible to be maintained with certain you know like you mentioned
iron for example and legumes you know the relationship there is that iron and
molybdenum are required as cofactors for an enzyme that converts nitrates I'm
sorry nitrogen gas into soluble forms of nitrogen for plants to take up they you
know these metals in particular are required because they have the ability
to pass charges around and when we're talking about nitrogen nitrogen is one
of those elements if you'll recall from the episode we did it on amino acids it
has a variety of oxidation states and reduction states so there's a broad
range of possible states that nitrogen can exist in and so when plants and
microbes are trying to access this and basically it's like you know spinning
the dial from let's say zero to six if the element that we're talking about is
all the way at six and we want to get it down to zero that's going to require
not only a large amount of energy but a large amount of elements that have the
ability to soak up a charge basically and allow that charge to be transferred
thereby reducing or in certain cases oxidizing so you know that that's one of
the more important overviews of some of these trace minerals is that they as
Jason mentioned or you know participating in processes that balance charges and
plants particularly oxidative stress you know we had an episode on diffusion
limited enzymes which are pretty incredible in and of themselves but one
of those super diffusion limited enzymes superoxide dismutase is a enzyme that's
responsible for what's known as the dismutation of super oxides which are
naturally formed when you know stressful conditions are placed on the plant you
start to get this speciation of oxygen that causes a lot of damage reactive
oxygen species so you know there's this enzyme that plants have evolved super
oxide dismutase and it basically goes around the cells and at the you know
function functionally basically at the speed of light it's able to detoxify the
plants and balance out these oxidation states of the various you know
components within the cell so again the specific transfer of energy happens
through some of these micronutrients like zinc which can hold a huge charge
you know and so it can cycle through that charge really fast just like if you
have a revolver that has you know six bullets imagine pressing the trigger
once and get all six shots fired at once that's what some of these
micronutrients are capable of doing they can radically cycle through reduction
and oxidation states very efficiently for plants and this is very very
effective for some of these metabolically intense processes like
nitrogen reduction for example or anything associated with photosynthesis
so yeah back to you Jason fantastic just reading through some of the stuff
on the chat I love that butters comment elements that we have no idea how to
pronounce almost are actually micronutrients there are you know and and
I think there are somebody was asking about chloride on here I think you know
in general and and doctor I've heard dr. Elaine say this that you know plants
probably use almost everything that's on the periodic table in some way shape or
form we understand a certain set of elements that are micronutrients and
we think we understand how these plants utilize them but I think there's many
many other elements and nutrients that occur in nature that are part of it and
and I you know that's part of why I believe so much in living soil and
natural approaches is I think you're not only getting the benefits of the
biology but you're also getting the benefits of a very very broad selection
of elements that are available in most nutrients or in most soils and and just
because we don't know that the plants use it doesn't mean that they don't yeah
yeah there's something to be said to about you know living soils with respect
to the relationships between mycorrhizal fungi and beneficial microbes and their
ability to produce little microscopic tools these enzymes that function
specifically to find those micronutrients that plants are very
deficient in because sometimes they're very scarce in the soil you know we're
talking about fractions of a part per million in some cases whereas you know
on the flip side for nitrogen in plants you know you can get away with feeding
your plants a hundred hundred and fifty maybe even 200 ppms of elemental
nitrogen you know if you have the environment dialed in that 200 ppm of
nitrogen is going to be what the plants are looking for but then on the flip
side you know still when we're talking about some of these micronutrients and
trace elements we're not really gonna get you know above 10 ppms I would be
surprised if you know that there was an actual physiological and biological need
for such high amounts and in part of it comes back to what Jason was talking
about with you know the function of these micronutrients that have not been
elucidated very far and as new research is coming out what people are
discovering is that these micronutrients have similar uptake pathways to elements
that might be considered macronutrients like you know sulfur for instance sulfur
which we went through has a very very tightly regulated and tightly
coordinated process of being taken up from plants particularly if we just
start off with sulfate which is fully oxidized sulfur has to get chemically
reduced selenium actually shares you know enzymatic uptake and processing and
transfer systems because keep in mind remember that a lot of these
micronutrients are required as cofactors in a very narrow band of biological
processes they're critical they're very very important but you know chloroplasts
have 80% of the total iron or something like that whereas boron you know 95% of
that's going to be found in the cell walls you know copper is found in
chloroplasts upwards of 50% and beyond and so there's really only a couple of
places that we're gonna find these things concentrated in massive amounts
and where we do find them we find that these substances are like key mediators
of electrical activity that's happening within the plants you know going back to
the whole concept of photosynthesis this electron transport chain that we're
talking about you know when plants take an energy from the light they need to
store that and it just so happens that metals can conduct electricity pretty
freaking well and so henceforth they make sense why compounds like iron and
manganese and copper etc etc might be found inside of these photo systems but
I also want to point out that a lot of the stuff is not separate from other
things that we've gone through you know going back to sulfur and selenium we
talked about sulfur being reduced from its fully oxidized form as sulfate SO4
in the soil you know it goes you know we dial we click it back maybe six clicks
or seven clicks or whatever and we get to a spot where we have a fully reduced
thiol group that becomes a constituent of one amino acid cysteine and that gets
converted into methionine well it just so happens that there's a tandem process
happening in parallel with selenium where selenium becomes a constituent of
cysteine it's called selenocysteine and then similarly when selenium becomes
incorporated into methionine you have selenomethionine and so it's almost like
plants have this ability to you know be a little bit less specific than I think
people sort of realize plants are you know it was initially postulated a
couple of decades ago and certainly the research has carried forward to this day
that there's all kinds of these transport channels and transport pumps
across the cellular membrane and we know you know approximately how much
energy it takes and kind of where it goes and stuff but all that being said
there's still a lot of really important things that are unknown you know and for
us to see an overlap in something like the enzymes that are responsible for
sulfate reduction with selenium uptake you know is kind of suggestive that
maybe plants even though these things are very tightly coordinated and
extremely conserved across evolutionary history maybe they're also designed that
way actually specifically to take up these trace elements and micronutrients
sort of in conjunction with the macronutrients to kind of help balance
that load out across the plants back to you great stuff so yeah I think we you
know a couple of the ones that I mentioned early on definitely
highlighted their their their focus on the ions and one of the ones that's
interesting is that boron is the only mineral nutrient that does not have does
not have to be an ion to move through the plant cells because it actually
connects or bonds to sugar molecules and so it is not necessary it's not
mobile in the plants but the sugar molecules are and some of the symptoms
of boron deficiencies include damage at the growing tips and problems with
flower and fruit formation borax is the or of boron don't go out to your don't
go run to your laundry room and grab some borax and dump that on your plants
though that is not the right way to get your boron by grabbing your box of borax
off the shelf you know the name of the game is to maintain a high amount of
biological mobility you know it seems like if you give your plants excessive
micronutrients and trace elements that they have these mechanisms and tools
that they've evolved over time to help sequester some of those back out into
the cell wall so when we did our episode on CalMac I mentioned that there's this
compound called pectic acid and these pectic acid residues are kind of
modified and tailored and fine-tuned you know just like a fancy suit and this
fancy suit allows them to basically slip over metal cations that would otherwise
create toxicity in the plants you know because again this all comes back to
charge balance and if you don't have the right charge balance dynamic happening
you're gonna get the plant stressed out one way or the other so you know that
being said it's interesting that a lot of the abilities that plants have
evolved are kind of still being discovered you know recently for example
it was sort of postulated and you know has been kind of discovered that if you
do foliar sprays of zinc for example that that foliar spray can actually get
absorbed by trichomes you know and whether it's translocated out of the
trichomes and in back to other parts of the plant is still something that's kind
of subject to debate you know there's still not really clear understanding of
the exact conditions that have to be required for translocation versus mere
accumulation so you know in some cases I guess it's interesting to notice that
these natural tools that plants have evolved to deal with the toxicity kind
of automatically kick in when you're doing foliar sprays even though you know
presumably foliar sprays of zinc and some of these other micronutrients have
not really been a part of the plants evolutionary history at least not that
I'm aware of so I think to cap off on I think boron you know reading from Ed's
book some of the symptoms of boron deficiencies like I already mentioned
which was browning and graying of tips followed by their leaf deaths you'll
also see leaves developing small brown necrotic dead spots that look like
strawberry seeds and are surrounded by an area of dying tissue between the
leaf veins boron deficiencies resemble calcium deficiencies everything gets
fixed by more Cal Mag right and can be differentiated by the small size of the
necrotic areas stems and petals are brittle and show signs of hollowness
boron deficiency only affects newer growth you get roots stunted and smaller
secondary roots become short and swollen as the root tips die excess boron is
more common in outdoor soil gardens it is sometimes delivered in irrigation
water and then becomes part of the soil matrix indoors and in computers it is
rare usually caused by overuse of fertilizers and it can be reversed or
treated foliar early as or through irrigation water and using boric acid as
a approach to getting that boron that you're looking for what are some others
for boron yeah you know it's interesting that the one of the deficiencies of or
one of the symptoms of a boron deficiency is that you have weak cell
walls and again that's because most of the boron left 95% of the boron is
going to get trapped in the cell walls of plants where it serves as a sort of a
mediator you know it allows the cell wall to make adjustments as needed and
in a lot of very complex ways to you know is particularly in the flowering
stage where you have a lot of cell division happening as you have your
reproductive you know fruits and flowers starting to grow this stuff requires
cell division and so now all of a sudden we're talking about instead of just one
of these cell walls being present there's maybe two or four or eight or
sixteen and so just kind of becomes exacerbated in the flowering stage and
you do see deficiencies of boron translate to poor cell division that
results in you know less fruit overall fruit that's not as properly formed and
all that stuff because going back to even the ability of the plants to divide
their cells this is going to be a function of boron something that boron
is required to actually facilitate but it's not very large amounts of boron and
like I said they do get concentrated in the cell wall so it's kind of the you
know the bread and butter on that one and back to you Jason I think you have
your microphone on yeah ready to rock so copper copper deficiencies first appear
in young leaves which also exhibit necrosis and a coppery bluish or gray
with a metallic sheen at the tips and margins the young leaves turn yellow
between the veins you also have symptoms of limp leaves that turn under
at the edges and eventually die and wilting of the whole plant new growth
has difficulty opening flowers do not mature or open in males and the females
the stigma the stigmata don't grow properly toxicity is rare but fatal
copper as plants approach death it the leaves turn yellow from the inability to
use the iron and the roots are abnormally sized and start to decay so
not only is copper itself a important micronutrient but it also affects other
micronutrients too as you mentioned where it doesn't allow for the use of
iron yeah yeah this kind of goes back to you know what we were talking about
earlier with a lot of these micronutrients because they have similar
properties to macronutrients that are utilized by plants you know if you look
at them for example in a periodic table a lot of the similarities will come from
the ones that are in the same column meaning that they have similar properties
you know like silicon for example is just a big fat overweight version of
carbon which kind of you know explains a variety of functions and variety of
benefits that silicon imparts and certainly for these trace elements
micronutrients the plants have the ability to kind of you know shuffle them
around in small quantities and they participate in these processes that are
fundamental and they're kind of cofactors you know they're required in
small amounts but they store a lot of energy you know it's like a very very
small battery that powers a very very otherwise large machine that requires a
ton of energy going into it all right I was hoping you were gonna speak for just
a minute longer I went and took a nice hit I'm still smoking through my flower
collection from the regen conference I came home with quite a beautiful jar full
of nugs and everything's just really really frosty and tasty so I've been
slowly working my way through the pile it's been nice to smoke some other
people's flower you know you spend so many so much time at least I do for the
most part I spend most of my time kind of isolated I don't hang out with a lot
of other folks and I don't go to a lot of events or anything so for me I'm just
usually smoking my own flower so it's nice to be able to get out and be able
to smoke some other people's work and especially at a regen conference where
most of the stuff was either Sun grown or regeneratively grown in some way
shape or form so I kept hearing oh this was who will grow and or this was who
will grow there a lot of Google growers up there in Maine too so it was really
nice but we're over the half-hour mark so let's go ahead and just run through
quick update this is Hota Herbs Grow and Tell thank you all for joining we are

cannabis project and fcp o2 yep shredder it does get me I do I do get
caught and a little bit of choking and try to keep that off mute not
necessarily cough into the microphone when I can but you know it it happens so
we are here this is episode 29 we're this week talking about micronutrients
and Nick has returned back with us as as usual is our good friend Nick from the
rooted leaf so we were taught we've talked about copper and we've talked
about boron do we want to keep going through each of these or was there some
other elements of these combinations of micronutrients that you want to dive
into first no I mean we can you know keep going through them I think you know
it's important for people to understand a lot of what we're going to talk about
is going to sound similar you know like with copper for example and its role and
involvement with photosynthesis its ability like you mentioned to balance
maintain a charge balance of iron because it's one of those things
actually if you look at what photosynthesis produces as a byproduct
it produces oxygen as a byproduct and what oxygen do oxygen oxidizes iron and
when iron is oxidized in the soil it becomes unavailable to plants and so
plants have kind of figured out this cool way of dealing with that you know
if they're really efficient of photosynthesis they got to deal with the
rise of oxygen and the subsequent oxidation that occurs as the oxygen
moves in and out of the soils so it's interesting to note that a lot of the
stuff is connected like wheels on an axle you know as one of these
micronutrients or trace elements is active and it's turning in the plant and
it's kind of doing its thing it's more or less hardwired or connected to some
other micronutrient or some other trace element or even a macronutrient that's
maintaining a charge balance and understanding how all of these minerals
especially the ones that are required and trace amounts how they have to be
metabolized by plants absorbed from the soil recycled for example you know how
they're transferred from vegetative to reproductive organs in the case of some
of these micronutrients not being very mobile you know there's still all kinds
of stuff for us to learn so yeah yeah back to you Jason cool all right we will
we'll keep going through them great conversation going on on YouTube I love
butters going through and listing out all of the elements in the periodic
table or that was great I definitely and I have had plenty of
witnesses Nate that I am a smoker I wonder if my corporate speak makes me
sound like somebody who doesn't smoke my coming across as a Chad is that what it
is Nate but that's that's that's funny I'm definitely a smoker and I've been
smoking for 35 years consistently and if you can't hear that in my voice
that's I'm surprised actually I can definitely feel it in my voice when I
talk but yes absolutely se a 90 is a great way to get a lot of different
trace elements which is sea salt it's it's kind of you know a lot of people
use ocean water in their Korean natural farming because there's a lot of
different elements and nutrients in seawater but sea salt or se a 90 is also
a great way to get the get stuff in there
and you know really really really an awesome way to get in some of those
different types of minerals that you aren't necessarily going to get in your
land-based soil at least make them readily available and if it's part of
the ocean water chances are it may already be in a water-soluble format so
let's talk about we were talking about copper and one of the ways to feed
copper is you know so for your feeding with copper fungicides such as copper
sulfate or chelated copper adjusts a deficiency I don't like the idea of
applying a fungicide in any way shape or form so I'm gonna disagree with Ed on
using a fungicide as a way to get hydroponics in copper into their
hydroponic met micronutrient formulas containing copper helps really well
compost green sand and kelp concentrates there we go Nick we got some kelp
concentrates soaking dot dimes or quarters in water and then using that
water to irrigate the plants also supplies copper because these coins are
90% copper and 8% zinc pennies contain the most zinc and an acid solution using
pH down potassium fertilizer lemon juice or vinegar can dissolve copper faster
Wow I don't I don't I I find it interesting I don't know that I would go
with any of those routes myself well you know it's interesting because plants
naturally produce organic acids like the vinegar for example citrates and
acetates as a response to some of these micronutrient deficiencies and it's
certainly true that when the when the our bus killer my car is a fungi and
beneficial microbes are in the soil producing these compounds that are known
as side air force for example in the context of iron that really they're
there to modify through acid-base chemistry the oxidation state of these
trace elements and thereby make them more available so I guess it's
interesting because when the plants are photosynthesizing and they're producing
carbon-rich molecules some of those carbon-rich molecules actually get shot
out of the roots and their function is to attach to insoluble and unavailable
forms of these trace elements and make them more soluble so that as the roots
grow with the help of my car as a fungi and beneficial microbes that they can
then access some of these trace elements so yeah the organic acids are very
important we're actually you know kind of doing the same thing we're using a
lot of plants that are rich in some of these micronutrients and we're chelating
and complexing them by using these organic acids because they put them they
put these micronutrients in a form where they are highly soluble in water and so
you don't need a whole lot to be able to functionally deliver it to the plants
whether it's you know as a foliar spray if that's your preferred mechanism as
you know is the case with some of these amino acid chelated micronutrients or if
you want to just do it in the soil you know like I said that these are these
elements are required in small amounts so you don't really need a whole lot
however the key later forms are pretty expensive so maybe we'll get into that
here in a minute once I pass it back to you Jason so I saw interesting comment
on here compost made with sewage sludge would have heavy metals I assume and
that's correct so Zaza Zaza Zaza xylophone
Zaza xylophone xylophone I'm just gonna call you xylophone xylophone
ZYZ a x a phone for those on the clubhouse it can't see the name on
YouTube yes actually sewage sludge is probably one of the worst fertilizer
byproducts that you can use it is filled with all sorts of toxic materials
including PFAS or forever chemicals there I just saw this whole article the
other day I was reading about how for many years people have been buying these
bio sludge from water treatment facilities as a fertilizer product and
unfortunately the products themselves are filled with all sorts of toxic
chemicals that are super super bad so definitely do not want to use any of
those types of products on your plants especially with something you're going
to be eating or even worse smoking so yeah so that's my slight comment on
using some of those types of bio sludge and outputs that come from treatment
facilities sewage compost is toxic as fuck absolutely Sonny Chiva and it's not
it's the humans absolutely but everything flows in there right everything
flows into our sewage all the chemicals that wash off the parking lots all the
products from construction there's so much bad stuff that flows in there and
it all gets collected so yeah you got to stay away from that stuff and definitely
do not use anything that's got bio sludge or bio mediated products from
water treatment in their products you know really should be just making your
own if you can out of things that you collect locally that are hopefully also
clean so let's go ahead and jump into iron so iron is next up on the list iron
deficiencies start in new leaves which lack chlorophyll but have no necrotic
spots this causes interveinal chlorosis or a yellowing of the leaves except for
the veins themselves which remain green new leaves start to experience chlorotic
molting first near the base of the leaflets so that the middle of the leaf
appears to have brown marks the veins remain dark green note that iron
deficiencies look similar to magnesium deficiencies except for the location
iron deficiencies affect new growth where magnesium deficiencies affect
middle and lower leaves first and that again has to do with mobility iron moves
slowly in the plant and is not necessarily something that's going to be
as it's going to be more from new affect new growth as opposed to old growth iron
deficiencies may indicate pH imbalance iron participates with even moderately
high pH iron may be present but not available to plant if it is present it
will dissolve if the pH is lowered and the preferred range for the pH is 5 8 to
6 2 that's interesting foliar feed with iron chelated fertilizer containing iron
zinc and manganese since these deficiencies are often found in
combination you know like you said iron is it's an interesting element you know
it's required in human blood for example because when whenever you breathe
in it's the iron in the hemoglobin that binds the oxygen and gets it delivered
and so again to sound like a broken record here it is the ability of iron as
an element to go through these redox states that make it so valuable and so
essential where it does certain things like find oxygen in the plants that
absorbs electrical energy and so you're gonna find if you looked in the plants
you'd find you know a lot of iron in the chloroplasts there's gonna be a lot
of these proteins involved in these photosystems like iron sulfur proteins
there's ferredoxins which we talked about a little bit and there's other
enzymes that that utilize iron as a cofactor because when they're trying to
make structural changes to a protein for example you know that has to have a
charge balance if you're trying to change the three-dimensional shape of
something it's like you're playing you know game of Jenga with a structure
that's otherwise very unstable so the ability of iron to hold a charge and
maintain a redox state affords this structural stability so now when you
have iron in the presence of these cofactors you have the ability of plants
to make these modifications and these changes as they're needed you know this
is why you find them in these photosystems
respiratory complexes like I said for humans every time you breathe in that
oxygen that's going into your lungs has to be bound by iron and then delivered
appropriately in order to transfer that oxidative energy so you can produce
energy as a result of breathing in and out so yeah yeah back to you Jason
sounds like you're suffering suffering from a little wook flu spending all that
time in Oklahoma around all those growers this past weekend maybe that
cough that cough from smoking a lot with a whole bunch of different people
it's it's funny you know like you get away even even if you're not sharing
you're consuming a lot more than you normally would at these events and I
know my voice is always hoarse after the events and I'm constantly clearing my
throat yeah we definitely smoked a lot there you know we had a lot of key way
that was happening and it was just all day every day and on stop which is a
beautiful thing we definitely consumed a tremendous amount of cannabis and
concentrates at the at the conference in Maine and yeah it's it's just fun being
around that many people enjoying the plant canna con was also a few weeks ago
here in Massachusetts about a month ago now it was actually the week before I
went up to the car the regen conference and all of us there must have been at a
couple different times there was 50 to 100 people out front of the convention
center right behind the Haines Convention Center right in downtown
Boston just smoking away and and I'd love just sitting there watching the
crowds of people walking by and some of us older growers tend to get stuck in
our patterns in our ways occasionally we need to be jarred out of our comfort
zone so that we pick up something new so I'm gonna go ahead and reset the room
we're almost at the 10 o'clock hour so I'm gonna go ahead and reset now and
then we'll jump back into the other half of the micronutrients and plow
through those so it is 10 o'clock thank you all for joining this is hope to
herbs grow and tell our weekly cultivation club we are here every week
on Thursday nights at 9 p.m. Eastern 6 p.m. Pacific we are recorded and
simulcast on the future cannabis project FCP o2 channel on YouTube so if
you haven't already make sure you subscribe to both channels future
cannabis project and FCP o2 and if you're here with us on clubhouse and we
want you to join us on clubhouse don't just hang out on YouTube although there's
always a great chat happening there join us on clubhouse come in the room come
say hi come join the chat that's part of the fun of clubhouse is the
spontaneity of the conversation so we encourage people to come join us here in
the room on clubhouse and come come speak and come join the conversation so
thank you Peter as well as London and the crew for helping produce the show
every week and thank you Nick for coming back we did have a lot of fun
with Jesse Porter and Ben last week and we will definitely get Jesse back here
for a conversation because I think the two of you would also be would have a
fantastic time together so we'll definitely try to get Jesse back here
soon to spend time with you Nick and Ben always is popping in and out as he has
time but he's in the middle of a huge facilities design and implementation
right now so he's gonna be a bit busy so let's go ahead and talk about manganese
manganese is as we mentioned right it helps enzymes break down for chlorophyll
and photosynthesis production the deficiency is generally found in the
young leaves the leaf tissue turns yellow and small areas of tan and brown
dead tissue or necrotic areas appear in the middle leaf middle of the leaf the
leaf veins usually turn stay green the leaf becomes outlined in a ring of dark
green along its margins too much manganese in the soil causes an iron
deficiency in if in addition the plant shows a lack of vigor manganese is not
mobile for fast relief foliar it sounds like a commercial in itself for fast
relief of manganese make sure you foliar and rub some into your skin foliar feed
with a water-soluble fertilizer high in manganese such as a iron zinc manganese
fertilizer hydro microbes or a manganese chelate then add the fertilizer
to water nutrient solution compost and green sand also contain mag manganese
but are absorbed more slowly than in the water-soluble formats yeah manganese is
interesting it's basically the cofactor that exists in a cluster within plant
cells which by the way the leaf surface is predominantly you know the active
parts of the plant that are going to absorb all of these trace elements
because that's where a lot of the oxidative stress happens and so you know
with intelligent approaches to foliar sprays for example it can be possible to
correct manganese deficiencies you know and doing it in such a way that decreases
the total amount that has to be applied you know because if you can increase the
efficiency of absorption and uptake by the plants then you have to apply less
overall so what I think is important for people to remember is that plants use
manganese to power the process of splitting water apart and this is
effectively the oxidation of oxygen which is one of the most bizarre
biochemical and physiological processes you know oxygen is so good at doing what
it does that it even has a term specifically for itself oxidation and
usually it likes to steal electrons it's very very good at doing this but plants
have found a way to actually oxidize oxygen and this is where manganese kind
of fits in so there's a molecule of water at the H2O that basically gets
taken up by the plants and it's split and so during the splitting process this
manganese cofactor this enzyme is basically absorbing and providing the
energy that the plants need to very quickly split this water molecule apart
without causing oxygen to you know quote-unquote oxidize and become reduced
and sort of maintain as a molecule of water so there's this charge potential
that's held by this enzyme cluster and it releases the hydrogen to power proton
pumps that's how ADP gets converted into ATP in plants and the biosynthesis of
ATP is a very favorable to plants they get a lot of energy from it so in order
to do that they have to have a proton pump and that proton pump is generated
from the splitting of water and then everybody knows since kindergarten that
plants breathe in CO2 and they breathe out molecular oxygen O2 and the specific
mechanism behind that again is this manganese dependent cofactor called the
oxygen evolution complex for those of you that are a little bit curious to
about it back to you Jason that's very cool very cool and I do I do appreciate
some of the sea salt absolutely we keep going back to sea salt definitely lots of
conversation on the on the YouTube feed about that you know it's definitely a
really really good thing and I appreciate the comment Peter that it
rubs the manganese on the skin or it gets the hose that was this classic
hysterical definitely have you had me laughing I'm glad I was on mute because
I would have sounded really silly in the background while while Nick was trying
to explain that breakdown so let's let's talk about molybdenum molybdenum
molybdenum molybdenum can you say that ten times fast I usually I just say it
and don't look at the word because if I look at the word I'm definitely gonna
pronounce it wrong just the way that it's spelled but symptoms of molybdenum
deficiencies are the middle leaves turn yellow as the deficiency progresses
towards the shoots the new leaves become distorted or twisted a molybdenum
deficiency causes leaves to have a pale framed fringed or scorched look along
with undersized or strange looking leaf growth older chlorotic leaves experience
rolled margins stunted growth and red tips that move towards inward towards
the middle of the leaves sometimes molybdenum deficiency is misdiagnosed as
a nitrogen deficiency however nitrogen affects the bottom leaves first where
the molybdenum affects the middle of the plant first and then moves up to the
newer growth excessive molybdenum in cannabis looks like iron or copper
deficiencies so foliar spraying it with water soluble fertilizers aids in
overcoming this deficiency seems to be pretty common approach for most of these
micronutrients is a recommendation to get them in through a foliar approach
and because plants need molybdenum in such small amounts a hydroponic
micronutrient mix is often the most efficient way to supply it but again I
think using that sea water or some se a 90 in a foliar spray is probably just
gonna probably gonna possibly give you the same results molybdenum molybdenum
toxicity does does not tend to wreak havoc on plants but excess molybdenum
causes severe problems in humans so take extra precautions when using it and
follow the directions carefully so yeah you want to be careful with molybdenum
you want to make sure you don't expose yourself to it even though the plants
have no problem with its uptake yeah molybdenum is one of those elements that
you know plants needed in such a small amount that oftentimes it's hard to
detect where exactly it fits in but the places that we have detected its
involvement in presence is going to be again in some of those primary
metabolic pathways particularly with the chemical reduction of carbon
nitrogen and sulfur and you know you got to understand to a certain extent like
these trace elements what they're there to do is afford structural stability so
if you have a chemical reaction that's happening in the plant a lot of times
these cofactors like molybdenum when they participate in reactions like
nitrogen reduction really what they're there to do is help create like a guide
you know for that process it's like if you're going bowling and you need the
guardrails up so it doesn't go in the gutter you know the the use of these
trace elements is like putting up those barriers to make sure that whatever
energy the plants spend doesn't go sideways on them it doesn't go in the
gutter so a lot of times you know molybdenum is going to be found on the
plants to help stabilize the chemical reduction of carbon nitrogen sulfur and
this is all very heavily dependent on you know the sort of the energy that
comes in from the light and so again even though we haven't really found too
much about molybdenum and it's sort of transport an uptake that suggests it's
you know required in vast quantities I think the presence of it in all three of
these cycles you know meaning carbon nitrogen and sulfur reduction those are
pretty important elements for plants particularly between carbon and nitrogen
so there's this very fine and delicate balancing act that's being maintained by
molybdenum and it's possible to recycle this you know element in the plants so
you don't need a whole lot of it in fact it's one of those that they do
fertilizer manufacturers do put warnings on the label to you know say
you know check to make sure you have a molybdenum deficiency or you know make
sure you don't exceed it because it will create a toxicity within the plants okay
question on the chat and our good friend what about Bob unfortunately
joined late but he did have a good question so we'll go ahead and ask that
now because we did cover most of these already so he wanted to know if it makes
sense to be feeding boron with calcium and magnesium with potassium you know in
my opinion the elements that are nutritional will have a lot more in
common with each other than they do separation so like the Cal Mag for
example you know our six to one ratio that we're putting in Cal Mag fuel we
tested a pure calcium chelate and what we found is that magnesium is actually
participating via ATP dependent pathways you know because magnesium is bound to
phosphorus in the form of ATP so whenever you have calcium influx into
the plants it requires the mobilization of magnesium and phosphorus when within
the plants to send that calcium wave out as far to the plant as possible and in
the absence of magnesium and phosphorus that calcium wave propagates less and
less because there's you know less energy to push that wave forward I did
I did mess that up he was actually saying manganese with potassium sorry Oh
manganese with potassium yeah I mean manganese is probably something that you
would want to introduce in the late stages of edge maybe early stages of
bloom because you want to increase the density of that oxygen evolution complex
which allows for the uptake and splitting of water and of course that is
fundamentally connected with potassium so you know plants are all about a
balancing act if you give them two elements that you think are going to
behave well all of the rest of the elements are thrown off in their ratios
and the plants have to adjust to that and so it's always like this equilibrium
and this homeostasis that has to be maintained across all of the elements
you know it's not just some that partner with others or this one and that one
it's like if the whole system is not functional and cohesive you get some
deficiencies but strictly from a physiological functional perspective
yeah you're absolutely right in the in the notion that manganese and potassium
would have excellent synergy specifically in the context of water
metabolism and plants and so if you're in the flowering stage you want your
plants to have this drinking problem where they drink a lot of water and
again the gateway for that is partially potassium regulated I should say
largely potassium regulated and then to a lesser extent manganese is at the
sort of the center of that enzymatic reaction and manganese cannot be
replaced in that reaction by the way so fun awesome awesome I hope that answers
the question I see Chad has joined us Chad Westport thank you for joining Chad
also has a fantastic set of shows on future cannabis project definitely check
out his stuff when you're not listening to the replays of the grow and tell Chad
is definitely somebody you want to check out on YouTube on the future cannabis
project as well so let's talk zinc I think that is the last of the
micronutrients that we're going to go into in detail so the symptoms of zinc
deficiencies new growth has radically twisted leaf blades zinc deficiencies
are identical by spotting chlorosis and yellowing between the veins and older
leaves interveinal yellowing is often accompanied by overall paleness during
the flowering stage budge may contort twist and turn hard when this
deficiency first appears the spotting can resemble that of iron or manganese
deficiency but it affects the new growth as we were mentioning earlier manganese
is going to be more in that middle
zinc eggs excess is very rare but produces wilting and even death in
extreme cases again Ed's recommendation is to go back to that same iron zinc
molybdenum micro mix to solve the deficiency zinc sulfate chelated zinc or
zinc oxide also to help adjust with that deficiency interestingly and also has
silicon added down in the micronutrient session even though silicon is silicon
is a we did a full episode on silicon so I don't think we need to cover that
today yeah and when we did our episode on diffusion limited enzymes you know
one of the things we were talking about on that episode was you know plants are
growing in a very very stressful environment you know if you expose
yourself to the sunlight for too long or the light intensity is too high you know
some bad stuff starts to happen some really bad stuff that is in certain
cases permanent irreversible and you know can give rise to life-threatening
conditions so we oftentimes lose sight of this I think because plants are
having to deal with the exact same things as humans except for if it's too
hot or too warm for us you know we have the ability to kind of deal with it by
moving you know we can move around the physical space you go under some shade
you go inside you jump in a pool of water plants are or you know immobile
they're they're stationary they're fixed and so they oftentimes rely on the
things that are most accessible to them right away to deal with some of these
stressors that would otherwise denature and break the plants apart these
diffusion limited enzymes that are responsible for being antioxidants in
plants like superoxide dismutase for example at the center of these enzymes
which by the way are critical for plant life such that if you were to knock them
out and get us plant cell that did not express express superoxide dismutase for
catalase or like the glutathione system we talked about in the episode on sulfur
if your plants are deficient in those enzymes you don't have a plant cell it
it's impossible it has not been demonstrated that it's possible to have
that kind of redox potential not present in a plant cells kind of a defining
factor of its life so you know with that being said zinc is a very important
trace element specifically as a role that it plays with this very important
enzyme called superoxide dismutase and it's at the center and it's there to
kind of soak up all this oxidative stress that is generated by the light in
the presence of oxygen aka anywhere outside that the green leafy plant grows
and it has to basically do it at the speed of light or at the speed of
however long it takes you know electrons to be captured and absorbed by
oxygen which is pretty dang fast so it's remarkable you know to notice that
plants have chosen elements with a great degree of oxidative and reduced states
because those are the things that get chemically attacked when the stress
becomes too intense for plants so yeah zinc is very important I think it's
oftentimes overlooked in that context whereas some of the other trace elements
we've talked about you know they're participating in the structure and
function of the cell wall or as cofactors to pass electrical charges
around for you know photo photosynthesis but now we're talking about something
that on the back end of all this activity has to absorb the stress that
can come out of it so zinc definitely fits that role pretty well back to you
awesome awesome so that is we got through the whole pile and it only took
an hour and 15 minutes which is pretty good I have gone ahead and opened up the
raise your hand capability here in the room here on clubhouse and we want to
encourage people as always to ask questions both on YouTube or come on up
in the room here on clubhouse ask question throw a question into the back
chat and so we will see what we can do about answering that what other points
about micronutrients would you like to cover today you know the micronutrients
they got a shuffle between really really fast states within plants and so
they're useful for electrochemical purposes you know perhaps maybe at face
value with the exception of boron although I think if you look more
closely at boron there is some intriguing electrochemical properties as
well even though it's kind of stuffed in the cell wall so you know the metabolism
of these micronutrients kind of happens fairly quickly whereas the accumulation
of some of the other macronutrients like carbon and nitrogen for example as
structural proteins you can plot that out over a longer period of time whereas
these trace elements you know they're constantly going through these states
very rapidly and you don't need huge changes or huge swings you just need
consistent levels and the proper ratios which is intriguing because again keep
in mind that as the plants grow bigger and grow older they're taking up more
and more nitrogen structurally more and more carbon structurally so it's a
little bit disproportionate such that at the end of the plants lifespan the
ratio of boron to you know carbon for example or boron to nitrogen that's
optimum for a plant changes you know quite a bit between the the earliest
stages when the plant is small and relatively under established under
developed versus when it's fully mature and it has a huge amount of biomass
mostly obviously defined by carbon and water we have the levels of
micronutrients generally stay pretty pretty small within a narrow range so
yeah that's what I have to say in summer fantastic just picking some questions
from online yes Chad we did actually cover that but the best way to get the
micronutrients are is foliar most of and and we went through each of the
micronutrients individually and talked about some of the ways to resolve it and
in pretty much every case it was recommendation of a foliar approach to
get those micronutrients in there most of them are not mobile or have limited
mobility within the plant and so yes absolutely so yeah no no worries at all
it's it's a good thing to repeat and and it also gave me opportunity to talk
about rosemary because we were talking there's a lot of people talking about
rosemary I'm not sure if there was a conversation on Chad show Chad about
rosemary on your show but people were talking about rosemary focaccia how it's
delicious you know rosemary is also amazing because it is a anti
carcinogenic too so it's something that you should be using when you grill if
you grill meats or even vegetables that char is actually a carcinogen that you
get those grill marks right is is a carbon and in some cases it can it's
been known to be carcinogenic and having rosemary on the meats while they're
cooking as well as serving it is known to help counteract some of those effects
so yeah rosemary is really good stuff
fun little fact of the day for you we use actually a lot of rosemary in our
product line it's not one that you know we've got on the labels but it's the the
antioxidants that are produced by rosemary it's rich in organic acids and
phenolic compounds that in a lot of ways function the same as these trace
elements and so I guess it's an interesting point to mention that a lot
of the species of carbon that plants generate in other words these organic
acids these phenolic substances so on and so forth in a lot of cases the
function or the mechanical sort of nuts and bolts of it mirrors or resembles the
function of trace elements that otherwise might not be available and so
I think it's very interesting to point that out in particular rosemary acid is
a very very good substance overall it's highly regarded as being valuable
medicinal compound you know it's very therapeutic and you know to some extent
I'm willing to you know bet that there's beneficial properties with you know
mineral cuation that you could use rosemary for so yeah rosemary is also one
of the it's a great companion plant you know it does have some beneficial
compounds that help keep some pests away not all pests I think Nate is mentioning
that mites are the only bugs that mess with wrote his his rosemary in general
most insects tend to stay away from rosemary it is it's one of the primary
products that they they're using rosemary and time oil I think in the
mammoth IPM product actually it's it's a combination of some rosemary and time
oil so yeah no they're rosemary is a fantastic fantastic thing oils you know I
want to kind of point out specifically that those oils the essential oils are
just like terpenes that disrupt cellular membranes you know if you
sprayed terpenes on your plant or cannabinoids for example those are
lethal to the internal you know components of plants that's why these
trichomes which are located as far away from sites of primary metabolism that's
why they exist you know these volatile organic compounds and these cannabinoids
are extremely lethal to plants in some cases and in the right context too so
the use of plants that produce a large amount of resins and essential oils you
know to use those as ingredients in preparations for you know against pests
and against fungi is something that perhaps is not limited to rosemary and I
think a really cool and quick example would be the use of chrysanthemum
flowers to drive natural pyrethrins and as a result of their efficacy I believe
it was in the 1980s or maybe even the early to late 70s that pyrethroids the
synthetic versions were actually synthesized because you know
chrysanthemum flower tea is a fuller spray just works so well and there was
this compound found within the plants that you know happened to be responsible
for this so chrysanthemum flowers are extremely expensive so it's not a
cost-effective fertilizer input and the organic synthesis which has been
developed as a much more practical and realistic approach to utilizing those
compounds in the context of agriculture. Okay so questions questions questions
questions who wants to join us up here anybody want to come up on stage join us
in the conversation ask a question add a comment on micronutrients so we've got
some wonderful folks in the audience here today any questions online about
micronutrients or anything that we want to talk about today I did also see a
super great post from or comment from Bob from what about Bob which is about
you know if folks that are not following Build a Soil Jeremy made public or open
source a spreadsheet for soil amending based on test results so if you're
looking to get some of those micronutrients back into your soil it
looks like there's a way to calculate that stuff out so very cool thank you
what about Bob for adding that and we definitely will will definitely need to
check that out I will definitely be looking myself that's a appreciate that
any other comments questions on the YouTube feed or anybody in the room want
to come up and join us you know as people kind of think about the questions
and stuff they want to ask it I do want to point out that the understanding of
micronutrient deficiencies and really the micronutrient distribution of soils
across the planet is still something that's being figured out I buy a special
type of tea from from Phoenix Mountain region in China and there's one
particular village where the selenium concentrations are a little bit higher
than in areas around it so it gives the soil a different color but then when the
tea plants grow out of it you know they get accustomed to the soil that by the
way it's an active volcanic region so it's very mineral rich and some of these
trace elements are certainly in very very low molecular weight forms and so
you know the color of the soil the compactness of the soil the physical and
chemical properties of the soil are affected in these tea plants in this one
particular village have been growing for a very very long time and kind of
adapted to it so when you brew this tea it has a very distinct extremely nuanced
taste and you can't find that anywhere else and so you know since the 1980s
people have been trying to like figure out you know if I take this cut off this
plant and I'm moving into a different soil it doesn't taste anything the same
and I think part of it going back to it is that these some of these plants have
evolved mechanisms over long periods of time to deal with elevated or perhaps
deficient levels of these trace elements and so profiling around the world of
which soils and which regions like in Europe and Asia even here in America
North America South America this stuff is still very very poorly understood and
there's huge variations and you know pretty much everything so as far as like
a global map that's compiled goes I think there's a lot of work that needs
to be done and it's certainly gonna be pretty cool as that work is done because
then people will see you know what is the distribution of these important
elements across the world so looking at the back chat here on Clubhouse Jody did
post a question earlier well water at 500 ppm using pro mix hydro medium he's
having noticeable problems after the first week in flower ready to send out
send water out for nutrient and contamination tests what should he be
asking to test for standard water analysis is going to give you a
breakdown of you know your pH your how much magnesium carbonate so if you have
an understanding of what those minerals are if it's high amounts of calcium
which presumably it is because it's up to 500 but you could be you know in a
position where maybe your best thing to do is to condition that water a little
bit which you know you would you know if you do send that water off for
analysis and you get it back you know feel free to send me an email or reach
out on Instagram because I'll kind of help you parse it and go through what
all that stuff means but it should be fairly easy to correct overall all
things considered awesome stuff I'm sure Jody will take you up on that and if not
I will poke him to follow up with you and it's great I know Jody has been
spending a ton of time very focused on getting his environment dialed in at his
at his facility so any help much appreciated I'm sure and you know Jody
just keep up the good work you will get there eventually my friend Cheryl also
commented on rosemary that it is also used as a stabilizer for solves and
natural products to help make them shelf stable so again more of the fantastic
this that is rosemary we have a hand raised here in the room Mitchell how
you doing today see go ahead and accept I invited you to join oh oh well maybe
he raised his hand earlier but can't join now any other questions I don't see
any other questions on the wine well I'll mention real quick about the
rosemary you know the production rosemary is a when we're talking about
cannabis plants we're talking about plants that are masters of terpene
ophanolic chemistry so cannabinoids which cannabis plants produce in massive
amounts are sort of the child between the terpene pathway and the phenyl
propanoid pathway as they're called terpene ophanolic compounds it's like
you have two distinct pathways going into making that up and all of these
molecules are highly specialized in the sense that it's hard to find you know
other plants in large quantities that produce cannabinoids you know the same
there's kind of a similar parallel to rosemary which is that it is a master of
producing organic acids that function as antioxidants specifically to protect the
integrity of a lipid bilayer so if the plant is dealing with oxidative stress
that could destroy the cell wall or you know some kind of important fat like a
phospholipid bilayer that makes up the cell membranes the ability of these
organic acids produced by rosemary to come in and to soak up that oxidative
stress is something that rosemary is very very good for it and hence its
benefits not only with manufacturing cosmetics and for increasing the
stability or the shelf life because it's technically a preservative slash
antioxidant but you know also in its ability to participate in metal chelation
reactions which is something that you know we've come to understand over the
past couple of years working with rosemary but I don't think it's
something that's very widely understood or considered to be you know practical
or efficacious at the end of the day but it definitely is rosemary is an
incredible plant produces a ton of antioxidant organic acids and that's
kind of its bread and butter its specialty awesome stuff all right so it
is 1030 we got to the 90-minute mark I appreciate everybody for joining this is
how to herbs grow and tell our weekly cultivation club we are here every
Thursday night at 9 p.m. Eastern 6 p.m. Pacific this is episode 29 we were
talking about micronutrients tonight for all those who are joining late or may
have missed out definitely go back and check out the replay later on the future
cannabis project FCP o2 channel on YouTube because these episodes are
always recorded and simulcast on FCP o2 we appreciate the future cannabis
project and all the great content that is out there so another question or
another question here in the back channel from Casey I know having a
balance of all minerals is important but are there any specific micronutrients
like sulfur conducive to trichome and terpene development yeah you know sulfur
is definitely required in larger amounts and within trichome heads because that's
the site where you have a lot of that oxidative you know stress happening you
have a lot of metabolic reactions happening and they're very close to the
outer layers of the plant which is you know has a lot of oxygen so it's very
volatile and sulfur is present inside of trichome heads in pretty large
quantities actually it's required for these antioxidant enzymes that we kind
of talked about already like glutathione for example those have to be in the
trichome heads for the biosynthesis of you know terpenes and cannabinoids but
but sulfur can be you know mobilized in plants it's very mobile within plants it
can kind of you know be repurposed plants can oxidize it it's certainly not
like in real time I mean there's a little bit of a delay and all that stuff
but you know generally speaking when plants go from vegetative to the
flowering stages you don't need like a sharp spike in sulfur but a little bit
extra you know wouldn't necessarily hurt the plants I don't think especially if
your your levels are below 30 ppm's for the veg side of things I think you can
go up to you know safely around 40 or 50 ppm's but you know anything above
that is in my opinion unnecessary when you look at the overall balance and
ratios of elements to one another all right so no specific micronutrients that
you would focus on to help with trichome production all right other questions or
comments today I see our good friend Guerrero grows just woke up another of
the fantastic hosts on the future cannabis project so we did cover all of
the micronutrients that we mentioned tonight there was I think
I think it was one or two of them and I'm gonna go back and just scan through
real quick and see but I think there was one or two of them that was definitely
important I think molybdenum you know is important for the synthesis of phosphorus
so you're gonna need that in that changeover time period primarily when
the plant is moving you know it's it's needed throughout definitely but more so
in that transition phase before you start going into flower making sure to
to get extra phosphorus in at that time not quite seeing anything specifically
highlighted in in the review on items that would be good specifically focused
except for boron really because boron helps transport potassium ions so
potassium as we've discussed is probably as important if not more important than
nitrogen for cannabis I would recommend folk in including boron as one of those
items to help with that flower stage all right watermelon jerky isn't that
you know dehydrated watermelon probably very rich in drink you know the outer
layers of watermelon the the white part and the shell on the outside contain a
lot of these micronutrients and then the flesh on the inside certainly is
rich with trace elements as well particularly in the seeds because as the
plants are growing across their life cycles you know they have to kind of
face with or you know deal with the problem of how is the next generation of
the plant how is the offspring going to access a micronutrient because if you
really think about it a seed is very small and for a root to form that may be
microscopic you could see this very very tiny little root hair poking out and it
may just be so small that you can barely even see it that boron that
copper that manganese those trace elements could be 10 inches away from
the roots and as you mentioned Jason there's this interesting phenomena a lot
of times with micronutrient and trace element deficiencies you have inhibition
of root growth and so the roots can't grow down far enough to actually access
this so there's this process by which plants will actually take these trace
elements micronutrients and find a way to stuff them into the seed of the next
generation that way as the seed sprouts it's got everything that it needs to to
grow and hopefully it's going to grow well enough and far enough it's going to
establish relationships with microbes and fungi that can help it access these
trace elements from very very far away in the soil so yeah back to you Jason
all right all right so yeah I still am not getting an explanation out of why
anybody would make watermelon jerky guys but okay I appreciate that so I think we
are we don't have any other questions listed I think another thing that I just
want to go back to that we mentioned earlier is that using something like an
SCA 90 or a seawater is probably a good way to go ahead and get some of those
micronutrients and get them in you can foliar with those items and get them
directly to the plant the micronutrients themselves as we mentioned multiple
times foliar is the best approach for getting those on there they are used in
minimal amounts that's why they're considered micronutrients but they are
just as important as the other macronutrients in helping us produce as
much carbon as possible anything else you wanted to wrap up with tonight Nick
no I mean I think that's that's a pretty good summary you know as it turns out
carbon metabolism is a very energy intensive process and it requires the
ability of plants to harness large amounts of energy that can be
transitioned across a variety of states very quickly and the advantage to using
elements like these trace elements that we're talking about is that they by
themselves can facilitate the conversion so they have this remarkable degree of
stability and predictability and reliability because it's inherent to
that element you know if we're talking about things that are more complex like
organic acids these are sometimes they have 20 to 30 different atoms making
them up and the whole point of these species or flavors of carbon that plants
are trying to produce is effectively to mimic the role in the function of just a
single element one of these micronutrients these trace elements that
can otherwise facilitate the reduction or the oxidation and the conversion of
various elements to each other so yeah yeah micronutrients are very very
interesting I guess that's that's my summary there
awesome awesome alright so that I think about wraps it up for us tonight we do
I'm not quite sure what we're going to be covering next week yet I do need to
get a hold of my friend Ben who I met at the regen conference not the Ben that
you know but a different Ben because we're gonna do a conversation on data I
mentioned this I believe last week but it's something that we're going to be
doing soon there's a gentleman who got a bunch of the data from the California
grow-off and took all of the results and loaded them up into a data science
model and pulled out a whole bunch of reports and analysis and he found that
there's actually certain terpenes that their ratios are locked in specific
cultivars so regardless of the terpene level that the plant produced or how
many cannabinoids that that grower produced in that plant the terpene ratio
for these for a couple of these groupings remained the same so that was
very cool that not only that some things are adjustable but some things
may not necessarily be adjustable there may be a terpene in there that we're
trying to maybe get rid of but we can't because anything we do to try to enhance
the other terpene is going to bring this other one with us so I'm not quite sure
if I can get him for next week but if I can we will have a conversation around
data either next week or the week after so that is definitely coming and we're
gonna work with London to make sure we get all the charts available because he
did a whole bunch of charts that help show the how those numbers compare and
kind of the scatter graphs on how all those things showed up it's very cool
we were flipping through it on his phone so it was a little bit small but I
definitely got it because I'm a data geek that's what I do professionally so
part of the conversation where you get into is actually a little bit of a data
collection and data maturity conversation as part of that talk
because I think right now there's a lot of data out there that people are just
kind of leaving on the floor and they don't necessarily know what to do with
it or how to analyze it or how to group it or how to classify it and there's
ways to utilize the information you have Jody for instance with your facility I'm
sure you're getting a whole bunch of information back from your sensors and
controllers and some of your visual and some of your information in your metric
system and some of these other things while there's all of this data all of
this information is just lying around and understanding what you have how to
classify it how to join it and utilize that information is all a part of data
maturity so we'll be talking about that and hopefully my conversation around
data maturity won't put anybody to sleep until we get to the really good juicy
stuff and we dive into some of those graphs and some of the actual
information coming back I do love the grow off competition because it is
judged based on the on specific sets of metrics I do really appreciate all the
contests like the Emerald Cup and all these other ones that are judged by some
really really talented people who really understand the plant not just the makeup
the chemical makeup of what is in the plant the cannabinoids the terpenes and
the other things but how well does it burn what is the how well is the flower
formed how well was it cured and dried some of those things are not going to
come out in the testing that's done but having a contest that is judged on a
specific set of metrics that takes people's personal opinions out of the
mix people's personal appreciations out of the mix is very interesting to me and
having all of that data so that we can go back and analyze it and cross
reference it against a certain cultivar that was grown in all of these different
environments tent growers and outdoor growers and greenhouse growers and all
these different ways that people approach the same cultivar that came
from the same parent is really really a cool opportunity so data is something we
will get into either next week or the week after other than that I'm sure Nick
you can come up with something interesting for us to talk about and I
also would like to at this point we are at episode 29 open it up also for other
folks to make suggestions make recommendations hit me up on the back
channel hit me up on Instagram send me ideas for topics or shows that you would
like for us to cover I'm sure Nick and I would be happy to go in and do some
research and prep and plan for a conversation if you give us some juicy
topics to dive into so please think about some stuff you'd like for us to
cover and hit us up and we will see what we can do you got to give me more than
24 hours don't hit me up on Wednesday or Thursday morning and say hey man go can
you cover this tonight it's not gonna work but definitely please send you send
us your suggestions your recommendations for things that you'd
like to hear us cover anything else to add tonight Nick before we wrap up no I
think that that about covers it I'm glad we had a chance to go through all of the
macro and micro nutrients and I feel like it was a good idea for us to lump
all the micros in together to one episode so I hope everyone got some
useful information and yeah looking forward to next week's topic concerns
of bioaccumulated metals toxins etc and commonly used ingredients that is a
great topic we definitely should look to getting some additional experts in for
that as well Nick I'm sure you're a wealth of
knowledge but that's definitely not your specialty or is it I know you deal
with it all the time in your sourcing of products yeah yeah I mean we source four
dozen species of plants three-quarters or land plant one quarter are aquatic
plants and in some cases we're actually sourcing these plants specifically for
some of the benefits that they have as far as this whole micronutrient
metabolism thing goes so yeah I mean everything that we bring in is tested
for any metals and there's no real accumulation to speak of so yeah maybe
we can ping dr. mark again and see if we can get him to join us might be an
interesting topic for him to jump in on okay well with that thank you all very
much folks on the hopefully Peter or London our YouTube producers are ready
to take us out of here I'm gonna close down the room I appreciate everybody for
joining us thank you so much DACTA DG drew Tyler Jodi Cheryl Leia
Leah or Leah we can talk about that and a side conversation as well I will get
back to you on your questions about soil for new plants so we'll talk about
that on the back channel I did see your message and I will get back to you
