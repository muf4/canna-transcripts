[00:13.440 --> 00:19.080]  And we're back another episode of the seed collectors. This is a fun show
[00:19.080 --> 00:24.440]  that is Dave the hand model over there. We got a pretty freaking rad guest this
[00:24.440 --> 00:29.560]  month. You guys probably are collecting his stuff but he's been collecting stuff
[00:29.560 --> 00:35.120]  too. So I'm stoked to have him on the show. Everybody, Brandon Russ say hello.
[00:35.120 --> 00:42.960]  What's going on? Thanks for having me on the show. For the followers who, people
[00:42.960 --> 00:49.960]  listening who follow along, appreciate you being here and tuning in. And if
[00:49.960 --> 00:56.160]  you're not familiar with my work you can find me on IG at Russ.Brandon. And yeah
[00:56.160 --> 01:00.800]  man it's good to be here. Talk some shop, talk a little bit about weed, what
[01:00.800 --> 01:06.080]  we got going on, show off some seed collections, smoke some weed. Heck yeah
[01:06.080 --> 01:10.480]  sounds like a good night to me. That's what we're here for. How you been doing
[01:10.480 --> 01:15.640]  Dave since our last time we've talked? I am wonderful. It's always a
[01:15.640 --> 01:18.360]  pleasure to be here hanging out with you Chad and we'll get some wonderful
[01:18.360 --> 01:22.200]  guests. Brandon it's definitely a pleasure having you here tonight. You are
[01:22.200 --> 01:26.160]  beloved in the community for not only the work you do with the seed you make
[01:26.160 --> 01:30.840]  but the work that you're doing with Bokashi Earthworks is wonderful.
[01:30.840 --> 01:35.920]  And a lot of people really appreciate that. So thank you. Thanks
[01:35.920 --> 01:40.560]  appreciate that too. Yeah I appreciate all the people who have supported me
[01:40.560 --> 01:46.920]  and what I do and it is not lost on me. So I try to I try to help out and give
[01:46.920 --> 01:51.160]  back to the community and help with educational content when I can. I stay
[01:51.160 --> 01:54.560]  pretty busy but I like to share. I like to be out here and kind of let people
[01:54.560 --> 01:59.840]  know what's going on and you know how to be you know. Because here's the thing
[01:59.840 --> 02:05.200]  when it comes to cultivation if you can be better at that or do it yourself and
[02:05.200 --> 02:09.520]  be self-sufficient you don't have to rely on a source for you know something
[02:09.520 --> 02:14.680]  that a lot of us kind of need. You know so it's good it's good because I've I've
[02:14.680 --> 02:19.960]  it's a good feeling when somebody comes to you and says hey you've taught me and
[02:19.960 --> 02:24.760]  now I'm self-sufficient. I don't have to buy weed from anybody anymore. I'm moving
[02:24.760 --> 02:28.880]  to a bigger house you know or a new place all that stuff it you know makes
[02:28.880 --> 02:33.440]  you feel good that you're able to help guide somebody in the right direction. So
[02:33.440 --> 02:37.960]  it should too man you know it's like it's making a difference in this world
[02:37.960 --> 02:42.360]  in a positive way. Something that we all try to do you know my mission has always
[02:42.360 --> 02:46.440]  been you know it's like if I could get one person growing their own medicine
[02:46.440 --> 02:50.640]  hell yeah. So you know I think you know there might be two or three out there
[02:50.640 --> 02:55.680]  now and you're doing the same thing. I actually love watching your stuff so
[02:55.680 --> 03:00.320]  that's fun and everybody the Vekashi Earthworks Instagram is down in the show
[03:00.440 --> 03:05.360]  notes. I missed the rust stop Brandon but we'll put that back up here. I also
[03:05.360 --> 03:10.240]  wanted to say though we're giving it away right from the beginning. Thanks for
[03:10.240 --> 03:14.660]  watching. Little bonus for everybody watching tonight aside from you know the
[03:14.660 --> 03:19.560]  good times and the seed collections. 10% off Vekashi Earthworks using the
[03:19.560 --> 03:24.760]  discount code FPC at checkout and there's actually a specific link. This is
[03:24.760 --> 03:29.040]  it but you don't have to worry about grabbing your pen and paper right now
[03:29.040 --> 03:34.040]  because I will drop that into the chat. Boom there you go so that should be a
[03:34.040 --> 03:39.440]  clickable link for you guys if you want to take advantage of that. So let me I
[03:39.440 --> 03:45.120]  will get the games going this evening. I've got one that's not necessarily
[03:45.120 --> 03:50.000]  starting it out with seeds but this is probably a seed company you all know and
[03:50.000 --> 03:56.120]  recognize. This one came in the mail today. I have been bugging Duke every
[03:56.200 --> 03:58.800]  time we talked I'm like so when you making shirts when you making shirts
[03:58.800 --> 04:05.760]  when you making shirts. About a week ago he finally put up a link and I BAM ordered
[04:05.760 --> 04:14.160]  it and dude yeah I'm stoked so I'll start it off with that. I gotta say I'm
[04:14.160 --> 04:18.240]  very jealous because I missed the boat on that and I definitely wanted to grab
[04:18.240 --> 04:22.800]  some of those some of his merch is looking pretty sweet so you got
[04:22.800 --> 04:30.840]  me you got me Chad. Yes yes yes this is a rare a rare occurrence here but yeah
[04:30.840 --> 04:34.320]  I'll have to I'll try to find the link again it was uh I don't know if there's
[04:34.320 --> 04:38.360]  a limited number but they were they were up the other week when I bought it so
[04:38.360 --> 04:44.400]  stoked with that and I've got some seeds that have come through as well but I
[04:44.400 --> 04:50.240]  want to let the guest do the honors. What would you pull out of your big bag of
[04:50.240 --> 04:55.000]  well first of all maybe just show everybody a little bit of collection you
[04:55.000 --> 04:59.160]  brought tonight. I got a little bit of book I got a little bit of some other
[04:59.160 --> 05:03.400]  stuff too though I got like I'm a huge seed collection of like heirloom
[05:03.400 --> 05:12.760]  variety vegetables and and flowers and herbs all types of good stuff I mean you
[05:12.760 --> 05:19.800]  name it corn tomatoes flowers everything it's like I got freaking everything and
[05:19.840 --> 05:26.640]  this is this is awesome to have because you know once once I have the ability to
[05:26.640 --> 05:31.800]  plant all that stuff I can produce all kinds of food with it. Oh yeah.
[05:31.800 --> 05:39.520]  Definitely my cannabis seed collections a little bit larger. It's a big bag black
[05:39.520 --> 05:43.400]  mama gloves we were like what is that is he gonna pull out some boxing gloves? No.
[05:43.400 --> 05:52.040]  I mean I got tons of stuff I got tons of stuff. Well what is let me ask one
[05:52.040 --> 05:55.960]  thing because you know again a lot of us we we search out your stuff and your
[05:55.960 --> 05:59.120]  stuff is on the dagga.garden site we'll get into that a little bit later
[05:59.120 --> 06:04.160]  because I know people are asking but if you can think back like when did you
[06:04.160 --> 06:08.520]  maybe start collecting seeds was it something out of necessity or was it
[06:08.520 --> 06:13.280]  like I want to get this and cross this or how did your seed collecting start?
[06:13.400 --> 06:20.720]  No so it's kind of it's kind of weird how it all actually came about because I
[06:20.720 --> 06:26.280]  have been you know I've been cultivating since 2001 or 2002 right around there
[06:26.280 --> 06:38.240]  and I think in like 2004 2005 my my friend did a crossed a sourdough with a
[06:38.360 --> 06:45.320]  variety that I had that I had hunted out from it was actually a bag seed from
[06:45.320 --> 06:50.640]  some like AAA's that we were slaying at the time and I found this I found a
[06:50.640 --> 06:54.880]  couple seeds in this it was really good they were really good AAA's I was like
[06:54.880 --> 06:57.840]  you know what I'm gonna plant these out and I found this one plant that was
[06:57.840 --> 07:05.240]  really really nice and so I had been playing with those seed with that seed
[07:05.240 --> 07:11.440]  line since then but it was never on like it was never me selling seeds in
[07:11.440 --> 07:17.360]  fact I was always just doing production and I wasn't you know I wasn't making I
[07:17.360 --> 07:24.840]  wasn't doing any crosses except for like I would do I did some stuff just for
[07:24.840 --> 07:29.800]  personal use where I would only be making a small amount of seeds by
[07:29.800 --> 07:35.920]  taking like when I would be trimming I find you know maybe like a banana right
[07:35.920 --> 07:39.960]  in the bud sometimes you'll just find one of those I would have a little
[07:39.960 --> 07:45.760]  medicine container that has like the little days of the week and I mean when
[07:45.760 --> 07:50.000]  I was trimming if I run the same varieties for a long time you know and
[07:50.000 --> 07:54.440]  I'd find you know sometimes I'd find a little nanner or something like that and
[07:54.440 --> 08:00.400]  I would put that and I'd save those and every once in a while I'd break one of
[08:00.400 --> 08:04.160]  those open with a q-tip and cross something that I really liked and I
[08:04.160 --> 08:07.520]  would run a couple of those seeds and like hunt out something you know and
[08:07.520 --> 08:21.400]  just I wasn't doing any any like you know production type seed you know
[08:21.400 --> 08:31.600]  projects until until I think the round I think it was like 2014 all right 2014
[08:31.600 --> 08:37.720]  is when I really started getting more into breeding okay I had done it I had
[08:37.720 --> 08:45.800]  done a bunch of stuff from like 2011 2012 2013 just you know making small
[08:45.800 --> 08:53.520]  amounts of stuff and hunting it out but when I got the I was helping this I was
[08:53.520 --> 09:01.760]  helping this old guy and he had set up this like makeshift grow room and the
[09:01.760 --> 09:05.760]  guy that had originally was like helping him out dipped out and he didn't know
[09:05.760 --> 09:09.800]  what to do and so someone's like hey I know this guy that can help you and so I
[09:09.800 --> 09:12.560]  went over there and just kind of told him you know what his options were and
[09:12.560 --> 09:15.360]  I was like look dude these things are harming right now like there's not
[09:15.360 --> 09:19.640]  really much you can do and I get in I was like look you can cut everything
[09:19.640 --> 09:25.480]  down start over yada yada yada I was like but honestly I was like I knew the
[09:25.480 --> 09:28.160]  weed that he was smoking because he showed me what he was smoking on before
[09:28.160 --> 09:32.900]  it was just Mexican brick weed pretty much okay and so I was like well you can
[09:32.900 --> 09:38.200]  finish this growing out it'll have some of it'll have seeds in it but it's still
[09:38.200 --> 09:43.520]  better than what you're it'll still be better than what you're smoking on and
[09:43.520 --> 09:52.480]  and the two cuts that were in there were the were the gorilla glue and the
[09:52.480 --> 09:57.280]  lime orilla so I worked with him to help him get through his whole harvest and
[09:57.280 --> 10:04.800]  then I took a bunch of those seeds from the from that cross and then I stopped
[10:04.800 --> 10:08.760]  and then I started hunting through those in like large quantities and then I
[10:08.760 --> 10:14.800]  started making selections on those and then using those in other crosses and
[10:14.800 --> 10:19.640]  those that's when I started to like make stuff that was like oh here I have a
[10:19.640 --> 10:23.360]  nice quantity of this to run through of a nice quantity of this to run to
[10:23.360 --> 10:30.320]  through but really when I wasn't until I got to Oklahoma that I started doing
[10:30.320 --> 10:37.160]  more of the seed production run and more because I had you know the opportunity
[10:37.160 --> 10:43.120]  to hunt through a lot more stuff fine you know because that like every back
[10:43.120 --> 10:47.600]  and count and Callie it was all pretty underground forever you know there was I
[10:47.600 --> 10:54.560]  wasn't you know I wasn't on the forums and ready because it's not smart well
[10:54.560 --> 11:00.440]  you know I had gone in trouble much time shit yeah right so but when I when I got
[11:00.440 --> 11:05.920]  out to Oklahoma I had the opportunity to you know do with like huge phenol hunts
[11:05.920 --> 11:12.680]  and do more selection and not have to you know have that that pressure so and
[11:12.680 --> 11:19.320]  also you know they have you know if I'm you know cultivating commercially I can
[11:19.320 --> 11:25.560]  always dedicate my home grow to projects you know nice so that was one of the
[11:25.560 --> 11:30.720]  benefits to of you know being out here because I could grow the stuff in at the
[11:30.720 --> 11:37.200]  facility and then I can do projects if I want to at home well that kind of made
[11:37.200 --> 11:41.040]  me you know I was thinking earlier about myself because you know it's nice to
[11:41.040 --> 11:47.320]  actually have like a schooled breeder on here someone who has and can run
[11:47.320 --> 11:51.920]  multiples and has looked for you know through a number of things but one thing
[11:51.920 --> 11:56.320]  that I hear that a lot of us you know here is we hear like breeding stock and
[11:56.640 --> 12:01.320]  then you know there's the you know there's like the fire and I was kind of
[12:01.320 --> 12:04.320]  curious you know you just mentioned you know like the production side and then
[12:04.320 --> 12:09.520]  like the home projects what when people are buying seeds if the breeder is saying
[12:09.520 --> 12:12.640]  well this is a good breeding stock like what is the difference between breeding
[12:12.640 --> 12:17.920]  stock and something that's like oh you know Zaza something that's good out of
[12:17.920 --> 12:27.680]  the good out of the pack or whatever well for me it would be the ability for
[12:27.680 --> 12:32.920]  that plants the characteristics that you're looking for to transition over
[12:32.920 --> 12:40.520]  on to another cultivar okay so something that is reliably passing on something
[12:40.520 --> 12:45.440]  consistently something that's probably been bred and yeah kind of locked in and
[12:45.480 --> 12:50.560]  so one of the ways one of the ways that you can kind of see that used like in a
[12:50.560 --> 12:57.560]  male right if you take a male plant and you pollinate several different types or
[12:57.560 --> 13:04.160]  different varieties and then you a pheno hunt out all of their prodigy progeny
[13:04.160 --> 13:11.120]  you can kind of get a perspective of what the similarity of that male is
[13:11.360 --> 13:17.560]  across all those all those lines right and so that's one of the ways that you
[13:17.560 --> 13:21.160]  know you can look at oh how does this thing pass over its characteristics if
[13:21.160 --> 13:26.480]  you were to take a different male from that same line and hit those same clones
[13:26.480 --> 13:31.960]  right and then run out that progeny then you could compare it to see what what
[13:31.960 --> 13:38.840]  that X factor was that it that might be consistent across that whole breeding
[13:39.040 --> 13:46.920]  you know pick out a male select it takes a long ass time to do that yeah yeah yeah
[13:46.920 --> 13:50.040]  I mean none of none of this stuff happens fast which is why it was cool
[13:50.040 --> 13:53.880]  you had all the veggies veggie seeds earlier because those at least you could
[13:53.880 --> 14:00.400]  get a little bit quicker satisfaction but there's only so many days and in the
[14:00.400 --> 14:05.160]  calendar I mean I guess if you have multiple rooms that helps but yeah at
[14:05.200 --> 14:09.400]  best you're looking at five six runs a year if you're just doing it intense
[14:09.400 --> 14:17.960]  yeah and you know I you know I originally had really just started
[14:17.960 --> 14:22.000]  because I had a lot of cool stuff that I wanted to preserve and see if I could
[14:22.000 --> 14:27.240]  make something you know cross things that I was already cultivating like into
[14:27.240 --> 14:35.600]  into themselves you know so it was just it was just kind of came with the
[14:35.600 --> 14:41.720]  cultivation eventually I guess well you're you know naturally curious people
[14:41.720 --> 14:46.480]  want to progress you know they they want to see what's next and when you see you
[14:46.480 --> 14:50.840]  know okay you know this guy over here is putting out great stuff he's been out
[14:50.840 --> 14:56.760]  great stuff what does it take to put out great stuff let me find out that's kind
[14:56.760 --> 15:02.320]  of nice and Dave I know that you you've picked up one of his there you were
[15:02.320 --> 15:06.400]  showing that off earlier do you want to maybe give us a little back story on how
[15:06.400 --> 15:12.360]  it went where maybe you pick that one up this I actually grabbed from seeds there
[15:12.360 --> 15:18.160]  was an auction James Bean and put up for bog after he passed away and this is the
[15:18.160 --> 15:23.720]  the TK and our TK TK and L5 is I think that's what it is I can't remember
[15:23.720 --> 15:32.480]  anymore I think it's TK TK times TK times TK and L5 Hayes was was the cross
[15:32.480 --> 15:41.680]  then I cross in the line 1 BX that line 1 BX male was F was a beast of a plant I
[15:41.680 --> 15:48.160]  wish that I would have kept that plant because I hunted that plant out of like
[15:48.160 --> 15:55.320]  that one plant stuck it stood out noticeably over you know 600 other
[15:55.320 --> 16:00.600]  plants and I didn't keep any of the other male stock and the only reason I
[16:00.600 --> 16:06.520]  even kept that one was because it was just too I was like Hank I couldn't kill
[16:06.520 --> 16:15.790]  it was just so beautiful of a plant and so I took it home with me and then and
[16:15.790 --> 16:22.670]  then it it met its met its fate yeah it flowered I put it outside with all all
[16:22.670 --> 16:32.750]  of them all of the all of the clones I had I had you know gorilla glue I had a
[16:32.750 --> 16:38.390]  reverse I had a reverse back cross gorilla glue that I had hunted out I had
[16:38.390 --> 16:46.750]  a I think I had my death breath in there I had a bunch of stuff I crossed a
[16:46.750 --> 16:54.950]  bunch of stuff into that one won't be X male one one thing I'm gonna pop up here
[16:54.950 --> 17:00.910]  and I think this this one plays into a few things you have but this is this is
[17:00.910 --> 17:05.350]  something that I got since the last show I want to shout out James joint
[17:05.350 --> 17:09.830]  cultivation he was on here with us last time but we're talking about black lime
[17:09.830 --> 17:16.950]  and got some of the black lime to cherry lime a to five these are gonna get popped
[17:16.950 --> 17:26.590]  in the next run now the black lime I know you do where I work with the law the
[17:26.590 --> 17:34.350]  black line a lot okay is there anything maybe I should know as far as like is it
[17:34.350 --> 17:39.950]  a finicky thing is it tall or stretchy or what what was it that about it that
[17:39.950 --> 17:46.510]  you were like you know what I'm gonna work with this so I the so the ones that
[17:46.510 --> 17:55.550]  I have experience with the all the phenos that I like the best they have
[17:55.550 --> 18:04.790]  kind of a flavor profile to it that's pretty consistent there is some there's
[18:04.790 --> 18:12.230]  some it mixes really well with some other flavor profiles as well so that's
[18:12.230 --> 18:18.510]  kind of one of the reasons why I like it also because when I did all the hunting
[18:18.510 --> 18:25.150]  on the black lime reserve times gorilla glue right the limo Rua that that first
[18:25.230 --> 18:30.430]  generation that population I ran I did like three or four different phenol
[18:30.430 --> 18:35.030]  hunts and I ran through a ton of plants and they're all amazing and then I you
[18:35.030 --> 18:45.270]  know started crop back crossing him okay and now I have you know I have my my
[18:45.270 --> 18:50.470]  favorite out of all of the phenol hunts of all of the different limo Rillas that
[18:50.470 --> 18:57.110]  I've had that I've gone through I have this f2 I call it I call it my f2
[18:57.110 --> 19:04.110]  breeder cut and it's a cut that I hunted out from the f2 population and it reeks
[19:04.110 --> 19:16.150]  like a really soapy chemical starburst with a really heavy lime peel overtone
[19:17.110 --> 19:27.390]  and so I keep that I keep that cut and I use that cut to do just like my in like
[19:27.390 --> 19:33.110]  back cross projects that I've been working on IBL lines stuff that I haven't
[19:33.110 --> 19:36.870]  really even I'm like don't plan on releasing any of it or anything it's
[19:36.870 --> 19:41.510]  just stuff that I'm working on stuff that you're playing with well that's
[19:41.510 --> 19:45.430]  cool and that's you know and that's kind of the reason why this one is getting
[19:45.430 --> 19:50.750]  pop next is um I want to keep it real good and there we go I want the flavor
[19:50.750 --> 19:58.070]  profiles you know I'm looking gene have some really awesome flavors let's see oh
[19:58.070 --> 20:03.270]  look at here's some lime one grape soda skunk times great eight times lime pop
[20:03.270 --> 20:10.550]  so that was fun show that one there oh he's he's always got some fun graphics
[20:10.550 --> 20:15.910]  on those yeah that's cool that's a nice one
[20:15.910 --> 20:21.230]  and this horticultural Association I've got a just I've got stuff from Seattle
[20:21.230 --> 20:29.270]  chronic seeds nice oh you know what actually some of my favorite I ran a lot
[20:29.270 --> 20:38.710]  of his IG handle is my name is Earl and I think he's from Maine and he's been
[20:38.710 --> 20:43.470]  growing right around this along about the same time as I I have and he's made
[20:43.470 --> 20:50.550]  some excellent crosses his DOS funk which I think is citrus farmer times
[20:50.550 --> 20:56.150]  granola funk he has some crosses some wedding cake crosses some Mac crosses
[20:56.150 --> 21:04.990]  with that and dude they are like there's they're freaking really really good like
[21:04.990 --> 21:10.870]  every single thing that I ran of his and I ran probably like you know I ran
[21:10.870 --> 21:18.350]  at least a dozen or more of maybe like six or seven different varieties that he
[21:18.350 --> 21:25.990]  created and they were they were all super super fire that's awesome you know
[21:25.990 --> 21:31.790]  again last episode we're talking with James and you know I always I'm always
[21:31.830 --> 21:37.430]  interested to see what growers or what breeders growers are excited about what
[21:37.430 --> 21:40.350]  breeders are excited about because oftentimes you know you guys will get
[21:40.350 --> 21:45.190]  sent seeds hey try this try this yeah never enough time in the day but that's
[21:45.190 --> 21:49.950]  also where you know that like the next superstar comes from for lack of a better
[21:49.950 --> 21:54.670]  term is like no no you never know what you're gonna get that's the crazy thing
[21:54.670 --> 21:58.510]  like there's so much and it's hard to like pick which one you want I got stuff
[21:58.510 --> 22:09.390]  from poetry of plants I got stuff from what's this this is GMO times LV RK f11
[22:09.390 --> 22:17.230]  LV RK what is that I think that's the the color Valley Royal Kush yeah okay
[22:17.230 --> 22:23.470]  crescendo I got some old bike seeds here now I visit these are gonna be kind of
[22:23.470 --> 22:35.590]  some East Coast genetics banana soft serve time sour banana sherbert I got a
[22:35.590 --> 22:42.590]  ton of bealy stuff that he gave me we were trading seeds at one of the shows
[22:45.150 --> 22:51.830]  yes yeah I got a ton of bealy stuff I you know I'm freaking stoked this is
[22:51.830 --> 22:57.230]  something that just showed holy shit I was stoked because this just showed up
[22:57.230 --> 23:06.750]  last week and I am amazed I ran his Kool-Aid man that he sent me this was
[23:06.750 --> 23:14.030]  one of the most triked out plants that I ever grew I was pretty stoked and then
[23:14.030 --> 23:18.950]  the flavor profile the smell profile everything is there like total frickin
[23:18.950 --> 23:24.470]  winner so I can't wait to dive into these have you run any of his gear yet
[23:24.470 --> 23:33.030]  yeah dude I run a bunch of his stuff there's the chimera to it was pretty
[23:33.030 --> 23:39.590]  dope but man they they stretch man they stretch big time so it's kind of hard
[23:39.590 --> 23:44.150]  they can they take a little longer than I like to but god damn the weeds great
[23:44.150 --> 23:49.110]  dude in fact I have some in my car over here nice yep I got I got I got my
[23:49.110 --> 23:52.830]  Kool-Aid man over here and I did I popped a few of those one of them
[23:52.830 --> 23:58.150]  actually stayed kind of short and and squat for me the other one was just a
[23:58.150 --> 24:03.510]  stretch monster and it was food hungry so I did two runs of that and then cut
[24:03.510 --> 24:10.110]  that one out kept the one yeah I really liked I mean they're all he has a lot of
[24:10.110 --> 24:15.470]  really really excellent gear he's out here in Oklahoma too yep yep let's see
[24:15.470 --> 24:20.350]  let's see so you said the creature I did got one pack of those left oh what's
[24:20.350 --> 24:34.150]  what we got there blueberry train Mac oh that's yours yeah but man I've got some
[24:34.150 --> 24:46.710]  of that in L2 on McCormick's time McCormick stuff that was a Seattle Greg
[24:46.950 --> 24:53.590]  project that they did together he sent him some old seeds and then Todd f2 them
[24:53.590 --> 24:58.590]  that was a project that they worked on so they hooked me up with a couple of
[24:58.590 --> 25:04.950]  packs that's awesome man because that in my mind not having run them but
[25:04.950 --> 25:09.950]  that's gonna be very close to something that doesn't have a hundred expressions
[25:09.950 --> 25:13.310]  in it that's something that you might want to work with something that as we
[25:13.310 --> 25:17.230]  were talking earlier might be like breeder stock again passing on just
[25:17.230 --> 25:23.110]  consistency and and to get you know again sources are so important for a lot
[25:23.110 --> 25:28.750]  of these things there are so many sunset sherbert's out there but there's really
[25:28.750 --> 25:33.710]  only a few legit places to get them that's why I'm big on like the
[25:33.710 --> 25:39.310]  Providence you know trying to track down who you got them from where you got them
[25:39.310 --> 25:44.110]  from what's the story like is this guy even supposed to have this so easier
[25:44.110 --> 25:48.430]  said than done but that's always been a big important thing and that's why I
[25:48.550 --> 25:54.030]  always like to kind of go direct if I can to the breeder as well oh I look at
[25:54.030 --> 25:57.630]  I have some of these right here probably would have to do in B.O. rescue but it's
[25:57.630 --> 26:05.870]  a sub cool seeds it says 2006 scarlet queen and then it says KQ time space
[26:05.870 --> 26:13.990]  queen 10 seeds I got a few of these actually somebody sent them to me
[26:13.990 --> 26:16.830]  because they said they couldn't pop them and I tried to pop some and I couldn't
[26:16.830 --> 26:21.710]  pop them you know yeah is there anything that you've tried out of the ordinary I
[26:21.710 --> 26:29.110]  mean people will say scarification in the matchbox gibberellic acid pop some
[26:29.110 --> 26:33.430]  aspirin in the water I've tried you know I've tried a lot of different stuff but
[26:33.430 --> 26:37.710]  it will come down to it if it's not gonna do it it ain't gonna do it there's
[26:37.710 --> 26:43.710]  nothing I can yeah I've had some of the older ones actually pop and get you know
[26:43.710 --> 26:52.750]  like a small tail but that's the end of their life that was the yeah so I've I
[26:52.750 --> 26:59.710]  know what you mean I oh you know what's another good good breeder is concentrated
[26:59.710 --> 27:06.030]  genetics he's another guy out here in Oklahoma and he did like the 66 cookies
[27:06.030 --> 27:16.190]  and he did well he did the deep do sterile I think it was called how did
[27:16.190 --> 27:20.270]  you find out about him was it a word of mouth or did you actually run his gear
[27:20.270 --> 27:28.390]  and then we're like yeah yeah so he was like one of the first guys on the scenes
[27:28.390 --> 27:35.270]  out here in Oklahoma that had clones like as soon as medical went and so he
[27:35.270 --> 27:41.390]  was already doing breeding work and so he had this cut it was I forget what I
[27:41.390 --> 27:45.910]  forget what the cross was but they called it 66 cookies and it got real
[27:45.910 --> 27:50.390]  popular really quick and he has I've run some of his other gear and he makes
[27:50.390 --> 27:55.830]  really good stuff for commercial production what I mean by that is it
[27:55.830 --> 28:02.390]  really has a quick finishing time it has the yields and production in the numbers
[28:02.390 --> 28:10.110]  to go with it so it looks really it's you know all the stuff that I've run has
[28:10.110 --> 28:16.190]  those characteristics as opposed to like you know some of my stuff I'll be the
[28:16.190 --> 28:20.510]  first to admit like I don't have you know always that fuck the biggest
[28:20.510 --> 28:26.870]  dealers you know like on some of my limo like my limo Rilla stuff that's if it
[28:26.870 --> 28:32.630]  leans usually really hard towards that limo Rilla side of things it's usually
[28:32.630 --> 28:37.350]  not gonna get as big but it's gonna be a lot more flavorful it's gonna have a lot
[28:37.350 --> 28:43.430]  more terpenes and you know a lot of people growing and a lot of people
[28:43.430 --> 28:46.150]  watching this show and picking up your gear too is they're growing for the
[28:46.150 --> 28:53.230]  head stash so like that's totally fine and then I mean I have a lot of stuff
[28:53.230 --> 28:58.910]  that I haven't released like that I don't plan on releasing to the public
[28:58.910 --> 29:03.230]  stuff that I just kind of work on myself and like until I feel like hey this is
[29:03.230 --> 29:10.030]  like this is it like this is the this is the thing you know for some of these
[29:10.030 --> 29:15.710]  parts because I have some stuff like the the death breath crosses which my death
[29:15.710 --> 29:22.910]  breath is a really awesome cut of a cross that I made I think in like 2015
[29:22.910 --> 29:29.190]  and it is the limo Rilla the black lime reserve times Gorilla Glue I took that
[29:29.190 --> 29:34.510]  my cross it into another variety that I created which was purple cush times
[29:34.510 --> 29:42.030]  grape God and I've been holding on to that cut for a while and I've used it I
[29:42.030 --> 29:49.830]  took that into the lime 1bx I've taken it into limelight I've done some work
[29:49.830 --> 29:57.310]  with with it on some other stuff too it's around here somewhere now some of
[29:57.310 --> 30:02.750]  the you know strains like we've got the black light and the limelight f2 up on
[30:02.750 --> 30:08.910]  the Diago website now but you just said you know 2015 which is something that
[30:08.910 --> 30:15.750]  you know that and others always kind of like surprised me a lot of times once it
[30:15.750 --> 30:19.230]  hits kind of you know like the collectors market or like the mass
[30:19.230 --> 30:23.750]  market it's usually been around for a while a lot of things I come out of the
[30:23.750 --> 30:28.310]  hills of Northern California as well you're like that's been around since mid
[30:28.310 --> 30:35.910]  2000s really I just heard of it I mean it depends you know when I when I was
[30:35.910 --> 30:44.270]  you know on the traditional market you know years ago nobody was really we
[30:44.270 --> 30:47.550]  weren't you know we weren't rotating through a whole lot of different
[30:47.550 --> 30:51.790]  varieties like we were going the same thing for a really long time just
[30:51.790 --> 30:56.790]  because there was no reason to switch it up if it was selling you know right and
[30:56.790 --> 31:03.110]  it wasn't until like later on probably around 2015 like things started to
[31:03.110 --> 31:08.510]  really like change up with we gotta keep up with all you know all the the
[31:08.510 --> 31:12.150]  sherbert's that are coming you know sunset sherbert hit or something and
[31:12.150 --> 31:17.310]  then there was all the you know people started chasing specific varieties and
[31:17.310 --> 31:20.430]  that's you know that's what they wanted certain things and so that it wasn't
[31:20.430 --> 31:25.910]  until then you know for a long time I mean I was growing purple kush sour OG
[31:25.910 --> 31:32.670]  and in Afghani bull rider were the main things that we were growing for freaking
[31:32.670 --> 31:38.150]  forever I mean I paid my bills for shit I paid my I paid my bills for like
[31:38.150 --> 31:43.950]  probably 15 years on that purple cushion that's our OG the a be solid
[31:43.950 --> 31:48.430]  solid man I bet you know that's another cool thing too is when you do grow
[31:48.430 --> 31:53.510]  something that consistently you probably really get to dial it in I mean your
[31:53.510 --> 32:00.350]  method itself is probably a blueprint of how to dial things in but just even I'm
[32:00.350 --> 32:05.350]  sure before you had all the you know tests and analysis you were able to use
[32:05.350 --> 32:11.910]  your gardening skills to really dial these things in oh yeah I'm gonna be you
[32:11.910 --> 32:17.030]  know I have a lot of old seed stock to like the Romulan blueberry times MK
[32:17.030 --> 32:22.510]  ultra this is 2003 I have a whole seed library train wreck blueberry times MK
[32:22.510 --> 32:27.190]  ultra the purple cush times Johnny Blaze I think Johnny Blaze is blueberry times
[32:27.190 --> 32:33.630]  Neville's Hayes so I have like old stuff in here too that in that I know is
[32:33.630 --> 32:38.870]  viable because I popped it you know in the last few years so what would you
[32:38.870 --> 32:42.190]  want to bring back first if you could pick like two or three out of that stack
[32:42.190 --> 32:46.950]  right now that you would want to bring back next which ones would they be I
[32:46.950 --> 32:52.670]  would probably keep working on this train wreck blueberry with the Mac
[32:52.670 --> 33:04.070]  because it's a really good pairing that it it stacks like resin and it brings a
[33:04.070 --> 33:08.430]  little bit the train wreck and the blueberry bring like come through really
[33:08.430 --> 33:15.310]  hard on the profile and then it and then I think that that at least the cut the
[33:15.310 --> 33:22.390]  male that I use it added a better structure to it because it has a huge
[33:22.390 --> 33:29.950]  frame but the actual bud structure itself is not really ideal for
[33:29.950 --> 33:35.190]  commercial production and so when I added the two together it gave it a
[33:35.190 --> 33:39.670]  little bit better on the majority of the phenotypes that are expressed there were
[33:39.670 --> 33:44.750]  some that were like like you wouldn't even want to grow it but I get like
[33:44.750 --> 33:51.150]  maybe one out of I don't know I grew a bunch of those but I had one I had one
[33:51.150 --> 33:55.790]  this this one of the times that I did a hunt on it and it was like the buds were
[33:55.790 --> 34:00.790]  like that fat but they were just big and airy and shit you know not something
[34:00.790 --> 34:08.310]  that not something that you would want to run for a commercial production it
[34:08.310 --> 34:14.990]  looks lighter it's lighter than it looks but you got some awesome awesome
[34:14.990 --> 34:22.350]  back catalog stuff there which yeah and that God's again that would be fun just
[34:22.350 --> 34:25.670]  to you know if you have the time and the space to start running through those and
[34:25.670 --> 34:29.390]  just see you know what's different what you liked about them versus what's
[34:29.390 --> 34:34.510]  available now and I see Dave Dave I see some blackbird preservation that's
[34:34.510 --> 34:39.550]  another person that tends to when I see stuff that he's putting out usually
[34:39.550 --> 34:43.630]  working with some older stuff but he's got some new stuff so what are you
[34:43.630 --> 34:48.310]  sitting on right now well you get the best of both worlds and what you're
[34:48.310 --> 34:53.550]  looking for there something like the 87 bottles which you get the 87 lime pop
[34:53.550 --> 34:58.870]  and the coca-cola root beer okay got the double fist which is the monkey paw and
[34:58.870 --> 35:03.950]  that coca-cola root beer and if you want something really old he did a seed
[35:03.950 --> 35:09.550]  increase on the Victor barn which is the super sativa seed club m21 okay
[35:09.550 --> 35:13.550]  that should be that should be interesting that he loves to work with
[35:13.550 --> 35:17.710]  some of those yeah he loves to work with some of those old-school stuff and that
[35:17.710 --> 35:22.390]  definitely checks the box for a for fit in that category yeah and then you love
[35:22.390 --> 35:26.270]  anything with the word root beer in it so you've you've added more to the root
[35:26.270 --> 35:33.550]  beer collection same with that one there but what honestly what has been the most
[35:33.550 --> 35:39.310]  excited out of all of this are these two here the the Brotherhood of Eternal
[35:39.310 --> 35:43.910]  Love vintage Afghani the seed increase that Bob Hemphill did oh as well as the
[35:43.910 --> 35:50.750]  the Jaro f5 from from mean gene I was I had to ask him like why is it what's the
[35:50.750 --> 35:55.070]  gimp why do you call it the gimp and it's because he was doing them in air
[35:55.070 --> 35:59.550]  pots years ago he had a whole bunch of Jaro's and one of them just was this
[35:59.550 --> 36:04.830]  floppy not growing well mess and it turns out he had left it inside of the
[36:04.830 --> 36:09.470]  air pot when he planted it in the ground so that's why it was not really doing
[36:09.470 --> 36:14.550]  well and he was gonna get rid of it and decided out you know I'll just let it
[36:14.550 --> 36:19.830]  let it go through and it turns out it turned around has this beautiful it said
[36:19.830 --> 36:24.270]  it reminded him of his NL clone that he had and it just this beautiful chunky
[36:24.270 --> 36:29.070]  resin covered buds and it they were they were calling it the gimp the whole
[36:29.070 --> 36:34.190]  time and it turns out it's because he'll then the next year when he dug it up he
[36:34.190 --> 36:39.270]  found out why Oh Wow happy accident right there oh absolutely it's like oh
[36:39.270 --> 36:44.630]  that that that shows some vigor if it can survive that now is that is that
[36:44.630 --> 36:48.270]  something that's kind of in production right now or he's still just trialing
[36:48.270 --> 36:53.390]  that one out I mean he this is more something he keeps for himself like he
[36:53.390 --> 36:57.990]  puts it into certain things like he's got the the f3 male that he's put on to
[36:57.990 --> 37:03.150]  a lot of stuff but this is it fine sure then that's that's something that I've
[37:03.150 --> 37:06.750]  never seen him release I don't know if he ever plans on releasing it but it's
[37:06.750 --> 37:10.430]  very similar in its lineage to the root beer which is something that's coming
[37:10.430 --> 37:15.310]  out now it's now he's got that back cross to that's getting released to
[37:15.310 --> 37:20.550]  everybody that root beer freeze mm-hmm which you can find out there on certain
[37:20.550 --> 37:26.990]  sites certain people have their hands on it but uh yeah it's it's got me
[37:26.990 --> 37:31.110]  excited these two big time these will be popped very soon
[37:31.110 --> 37:35.270]  we show the the one I think that's Bob Marley hopefully that is I don't want to
[37:35.270 --> 37:39.510]  sound it is not Bob Marley but it looks like Bob Marley I need new glass okay
[37:39.510 --> 37:43.510]  see now now I can tell that's okay that looks more like Jesus and Bob Marley but
[37:43.950 --> 37:50.830]  probably not hey someone some could argue that Bob Marley is Jesus all right
[37:50.830 --> 37:55.590]  so now that I've fumbled that one what okay so this was so Bob hemp Hill okay
[37:55.590 --> 38:01.190]  that's another older name that has the access to stuff do you know much more
[38:01.190 --> 38:07.830]  about that one as far as like this is sure well why did you want to be at
[38:07.830 --> 38:14.110]  Afghani it's old-school Afghani Brotherhood of Eternal Love they were
[38:14.110 --> 38:19.990]  hippies the the hippie mafia back in the day and they had gone around collecting
[38:19.990 --> 38:24.830]  seeds as well as distributing LSD to many people but they're the seeds that
[38:24.830 --> 38:29.610]  they had gotten a hold of he had gotten his hands on and decided to do an
[38:29.610 --> 38:34.550]  increase and make it available to the public and I was fortunate enough to
[38:34.550 --> 38:37.910]  it's a couple years ago that he did this but I was fortunate enough to pick
[38:37.910 --> 38:45.070]  some up recently that's awesome so when you're hunting Brandon what what makes
[38:45.070 --> 38:50.110]  you kind of look for or want to go pick up a pack is it you know a breeder that
[38:50.110 --> 38:54.070]  you've had good success with in the past are you hunting a certain profile or
[38:54.070 --> 38:57.750]  maybe something to work into something else what are you looking for these
[38:57.750 --> 39:09.390]  days oh man Terps that's my thing I just I want to find that I want to find
[39:09.390 --> 39:14.790]  stuff that's really sticks out to me that I has that you know kick in the
[39:14.790 --> 39:25.070]  face type of flavor and I love those strains that there's no denying like
[39:25.070 --> 39:32.870]  what it is like you're like oh yeah you okay you do you yep so you know that's
[39:32.870 --> 39:40.990]  in high obviously I need high but it's it's really it's an interesting kind of
[39:40.990 --> 39:46.910]  thing because not always the prettiest weed gets you you know sometimes the
[39:46.910 --> 39:51.430]  ugliest we might be the stuff that gets you the highest you know so you have to
[39:51.430 --> 39:58.510]  be able to find you know things that have the right high at least for me have
[39:58.510 --> 40:03.310]  the right high that I like and then if you're again running anything on
[40:03.310 --> 40:09.230]  commercial production it has to have bag appeal has to have yield it has to have
[40:09.230 --> 40:16.470]  you know it has to hit numbers as far as like on testing things like that you
[40:16.470 --> 40:21.470]  know a lot more boxes to check than just the head stash but who knows you
[40:21.470 --> 40:25.310]  know definitely so it depends on what you're really going for and I guess
[40:25.310 --> 40:30.470]  that's kind of one of the things that you know like the stuff that I have you
[40:30.470 --> 40:35.150]  you know I know that there are people that are hunting it out right now for to
[40:35.150 --> 40:39.190]  run it at you know on commercial scales and other people that have done it I
[40:39.190 --> 40:48.670]  have to but there I but I've seen other people's gear that would outperform as
[40:48.670 --> 40:56.270]  far as like yields and numbers as far as like THC right and so when you're
[40:56.270 --> 41:01.150]  operating like on commercial at on commercial scale for like legal markets
[41:01.150 --> 41:06.590]  and your consumer is a lot of times uneducated you know people who are
[41:06.590 --> 41:12.310]  looking at either numbers or just most people are you know our costs you know
[41:12.310 --> 41:18.750]  can cost conservative I am too man I'm always looking for a deal yeah so if I
[41:18.750 --> 41:23.710]  can find something that's that's decent for an affordable price that's usually
[41:23.710 --> 41:28.350]  what I'll go with I mean so you have to be able to have a kind of a forward
[41:28.350 --> 41:36.550]  thinking on what your end goal is for your project and for me for me it's the
[41:36.550 --> 41:40.350]  the types of people that are enjoying this for their for themselves because
[41:40.350 --> 41:44.350]  they can get really good results and at the end of the day they can have good
[41:44.350 --> 41:53.150]  turps and a nice heady a nice heady yeah going to go along with it you know yeah
[41:53.150 --> 41:56.510]  I mean getting into some of these genetics that I've been getting into
[41:56.510 --> 42:01.790]  over the last few years is a really a big difference you know again terpenes
[42:01.790 --> 42:04.670]  and the expressions like you said you you know you're searching for something
[42:04.670 --> 42:10.470]  unique and that's kind of a good thing about the explosion of like growing and
[42:10.470 --> 42:14.990]  you know ability to do these things because I think maybe that's why we're
[42:14.990 --> 42:19.950]  finding so many different expressions just worse we're doing it in numbers now
[42:19.950 --> 42:24.510]  whereas before it wasn't possible now there's just so many numbers that these
[42:24.510 --> 42:30.830]  things are rising to the top yeah cuz it kind of went for me anyway it was like
[42:30.830 --> 42:35.790]  there was like pine weed and then there was the stuff that was like train wreck
[42:35.790 --> 42:41.310]  and the Jack hair which was kind of like that pine solid cleaner and that was
[42:41.310 --> 42:48.550]  like really dominant in most of the chronic that I would get when I was a
[42:48.550 --> 42:55.030]  lot younger and it wasn't until I started cultivating that I got see some
[42:55.030 --> 43:05.230]  of the blueberries and the sour and cush and you know and then even further
[43:05.230 --> 43:10.950]  we get in again like you said there's so many different types of weed out there
[43:10.950 --> 43:16.590]  so that's a huge one of my favorites that was kind of really new to me was
[43:16.590 --> 43:22.630]  this one called contagion from concentrated genetics and I think was
[43:22.630 --> 43:29.950]  orange flambe times a cross city called 12 monkeys I think is what it was I
[43:29.950 --> 43:37.150]  might be wrong I might be wrong on the cross but it had it smelt exactly like
[43:37.150 --> 43:44.790]  an orange Julius nice it had that really super orange citrus with like this
[43:44.790 --> 43:54.230]  creamy milky it was really sweet and smooth smelling but it also had this
[43:54.230 --> 44:01.150]  this like really pungent ripeness if that makes sense not sour it was like a
[44:01.150 --> 44:08.470]  really sweet pungent okay like a decaying fruit almost yeah okay but with
[44:08.470 --> 44:15.150]  those but with those orange and vanilla cream types you know notes like heavily
[44:15.150 --> 44:19.390]  defined in that and that was like I was like wow I like this and the reason why
[44:19.390 --> 44:26.670]  I liked it too was because that the smoke translated over to the the terpene
[44:26.670 --> 44:31.630]  profile the flavor of it it translated really well because you know I've I've
[44:31.630 --> 44:35.310]  had a lot of different varieties where you know have a smell to it or smell a
[44:35.310 --> 44:40.110]  certain way but it doesn't you know it doesn't taste like that mm-hmm that's
[44:40.110 --> 44:44.990]  that's a little disappointing sometimes she's like oh we were almost there it's
[44:44.990 --> 44:48.230]  funny you mentioned orange Julius though I was talking something about the mall
[44:48.230 --> 44:51.310]  the other day and they're like no we never hung out there I'm like what you
[44:51.310 --> 44:54.950]  don't know orange Julius like that was the thing go to the mall hang out by
[44:54.950 --> 45:01.150]  orange Julius and find this find a few people to go skate with later it's it's
[45:01.150 --> 45:06.830]  that that that drink that they make is delicious it's kind of like an orange
[45:06.830 --> 45:12.310]  it's almost like a root beer float but if you were to use orange soda instead
[45:12.310 --> 45:18.950]  and it's a it there's enough real orange taste to it that it almost kind of
[45:18.950 --> 45:26.430]  tricks you into feeling like this is a health drink Dave I see you got you know
[45:26.430 --> 45:31.510]  a bunch of stuff up there I want to ask maybe what do you have up there that you
[45:31.510 --> 45:36.750]  picked up or you're excited about for the terpene profile and then I got
[45:36.750 --> 45:43.910]  another chat question for you as well about one of those packs sure I would
[45:43.910 --> 45:48.870]  say for the terpene profile the skunky lime that would be something that should
[45:48.870 --> 45:52.310]  be right up your alley the Jaime Chiba roadkill skunk and some black lime
[45:52.310 --> 45:58.950]  reserve f1 okay something that's gonna fit both or hopefully fit both realms
[45:58.950 --> 46:03.990]  get some some skunk and some lime mixed together then for like some more lime
[46:03.990 --> 46:08.110]  because everybody loves black lime got that old-school Williams wonder and
[46:08.110 --> 46:13.670]  black lime reserve so you get that old-school dank or that just earthy
[46:13.670 --> 46:19.430]  nasty rank profile mix that in with some some lime then you've got some of that
[46:19.790 --> 46:24.590]  vintage Afghani that we were just looking at this lovely stuff here mixed
[46:24.590 --> 46:29.950]  in with some of the the dog walker that Woodman Canyon oil can and then l5 so
[46:29.950 --> 46:37.230]  that that could be some real nasty old-school dank right up my alley
[46:37.230 --> 46:44.750]  L a leaf seed Co is that how did I left I left actually it was mean gene who
[46:44.750 --> 46:49.830]  had pointed him out one day I forget my Instagram somewhere I saw it and I
[46:49.830 --> 46:55.590]  started following the dude and love what I saw the man seems to have every
[46:55.590 --> 47:01.190]  fucking cut imaginable again you know like we're saying at the beginning of
[47:01.190 --> 47:04.950]  the show when you know someone's work that you like talks about someone that
[47:04.950 --> 47:10.150]  they found that they like pay attention and if you rewatch the show Brandon's
[47:10.150 --> 47:17.470]  dropped at least two of those you can listen back to that I actually want to
[47:17.470 --> 47:22.270]  drop this one in here too I'm gonna drop the link in chat everybody if you want
[47:22.270 --> 47:26.550]  to take advantage 10% off of Bokashi earthworks using the discount code FCP
[47:26.550 --> 47:30.910]  at the checkout but we've got a specific link for that so again I'll drop that
[47:30.910 --> 47:38.870]  here in the chat and here was that question for you Dave what lemon hoko
[47:38.870 --> 47:45.110]  pack is that that is the Royal chem DD so you got the Royal kush and the chem
[47:45.110 --> 47:52.110]  DD which is chem D and sour diesel so some some good stuff in there I lemon
[47:52.110 --> 47:58.910]  hoko is an absolute gentleman I love that guy just a really good good man and
[47:58.910 --> 48:06.830]  a good breeder a guy who's been working at this for 20 to 30 years yeah I always
[48:06.990 --> 48:12.910]  root for him he's in my home state and it's interesting to listen to some of
[48:12.910 --> 48:19.590]  his stories and kind of put a and B together and I'm like we're probably one
[48:19.590 --> 48:24.550]  degree separated for many many years and just never knew it so that's always kind
[48:24.550 --> 48:29.630]  of fun when you hear stories about people now that they're open to talk
[48:29.630 --> 48:34.830]  yeah he's an excellent I just love that guy he said he hooked me up with a lot
[48:34.830 --> 48:44.550]  of stuff recently got the hog dog v2 f3 Q blue you blue Q blue tell me tell me
[48:44.550 --> 48:54.230]  what is Q blue that is his Russell Wilson blueberry okay okay I'm gonna I'm
[48:54.230 --> 49:00.990]  just gonna okay I love lemon hoko and I love what he does but I'm gonna shit on
[49:00.990 --> 49:06.710]  Russell Wilson right now and just be like the real Seahawk of all time was
[49:06.710 --> 49:13.950]  the boss the best Seahawk ever was the boss can't mess with Bosworth and
[49:13.950 --> 49:18.870]  Russell Wilson he's playing for Denver now which Seattle just beat hell yeah
[49:18.870 --> 49:24.230]  one of the best boss gimmicks that he did he was such a heel he was so hated
[49:24.230 --> 49:30.070]  that when he went to play in Denver that first year he started a little side
[49:30.070 --> 49:33.870]  company that was basically printing t-shirts that said fuck the boss you
[49:33.870 --> 49:39.110]  know like whatever sold out huge hit showed up on the news and everything
[49:39.110 --> 49:43.070]  everybody in Denver's wearing their shirt and then it comes out he's the one
[49:43.070 --> 49:51.150]  who made him legend status that is that is Brian Bosworth man he he ruined his
[49:51.150 --> 49:58.270]  career with steroids but yeah he's he's the he's the OG Seahawk there oh okay
[49:58.270 --> 50:02.670]  you got some balls that you got fancy oh damn okay I was gonna say you have
[50:02.670 --> 50:08.110]  fancy green packaging but I have the sticker haha but you flipped it around
[50:08.110 --> 50:15.430]  all right damn you sorry I don't have a black mamba bag though that's that's one
[50:15.430 --> 50:21.510]  thing I'm missing yes and then you said well you picked up some of Seattle
[50:21.510 --> 50:26.910]  chronic stuff as well and he's uh he's in Oklahoma now too so these recently
[50:26.910 --> 50:34.990]  I'm not sure if they're old or not Amsterdam seed company oh wow huh I
[50:34.990 --> 50:41.270]  don't think they're that old but somebody sent me these a lot of different
[50:41.270 --> 50:50.710]  stuff just uh is that are they hazes or so this one says the real McCoy okay so
[50:50.710 --> 50:54.350]  you're not familiar with any of these so that's why I was like I'm not I'm not
[50:54.350 --> 51:06.710]  sure mixed this one says sativa divas this one says fuma con Diablo's hmm and
[51:06.710 --> 51:14.030]  this one says California sunrise okay cows you put put the word California on
[51:14.030 --> 51:18.270]  anything over there and it sells for twice as much it's like cookies here
[51:18.270 --> 51:28.920]  just California there yeah it's always interesting to get some from overseas
[51:28.920 --> 51:37.440]  oh what do we got here Dave let's see that looks like a mr. nice okay yes
[51:39.440 --> 51:45.560]  g13 Hayes that sounds good g13 that's one of the stories with lemon
[51:45.560 --> 51:52.040]  hoco that made me be like dude we were we were right there when he told his his
[51:52.040 --> 51:58.320]  story of that it's like good lord that's that's cool shit I was a teenager at the
[51:58.320 --> 52:08.080]  time though let's see here I've got a question in chat for Brandon here mr.
[52:08.080 --> 52:13.200]  Magoo Chad what bar can you ask Brandon for a description of his blueberry Mac
[52:13.200 --> 52:24.920]  cross me put that up there it's sold out it's a holdout left on that one yeah
[52:24.920 --> 52:31.040]  yeah you know some of these things they come and they go pretty blueberry the
[52:31.040 --> 52:38.280]  blueberry train Mac okay so I'll give you a little backstory on what um this
[52:38.280 --> 52:42.240]  was kind of this was way when I back when I first started there was a like a
[52:42.240 --> 52:47.080]  crew of you know older guys that brought me under and they were you know
[52:47.080 --> 52:50.640]  they were friends and different people were growing so it was just like a
[52:50.640 --> 52:57.080]  circle of like underground growers and stuff and one of the guys he was he had
[52:57.080 --> 53:02.600]  crossed a bunch he had I think it was in 2001 that he did all the blueberry stuff
[53:02.600 --> 53:10.840]  but what he had gotten he had gotten a pack of that blueberry drop I think from
[53:10.840 --> 53:15.640]  DJ short I think it happened in like 1998 and somebody gave him a pack of
[53:15.640 --> 53:21.920]  that and so he grew out all of the plants and selected a male just out of
[53:21.920 --> 53:28.520]  that pack back in 2001 and crossed it on there like trainwreck truck cross on a
[53:28.520 --> 53:36.640]  bull rider crossed it on Romulan crossed it on to man he crossed it onto a bunch I
[53:36.640 --> 53:42.000]  think great white shark a bunch of different crosses he put this male on
[53:42.000 --> 53:48.320]  and so when I got out there one of the varieties that he was growing was it was
[53:48.320 --> 53:56.040]  called TV was trainwreck blueberry and this this cut was absolutely my it still
[53:56.040 --> 54:00.480]  is today I absolutely love the terpene profile because it's just it's like this
[54:00.480 --> 54:10.160]  really sweet creamy blueberry with this really heavy like citrus pine and I love
[54:10.160 --> 54:14.720]  the flavor profile of it I always have I've always loved the effect of it and I
[54:14.720 --> 54:19.120]  ran that cut for a really long time I used that cut in my sour cheese berry
[54:19.120 --> 54:26.440]  cross back in like 2011 I think and I was running that that cut off and on for
[54:26.440 --> 54:31.280]  a really long time like I do runs of it here do runs runs it wasn't the best
[54:31.280 --> 54:38.480]  seller you know the cush the sour OG the purple push the a be they sold better
[54:38.480 --> 54:44.560]  you know but I do some runs of that blueberry trainwreck man and I absolutely
[54:44.560 --> 54:51.000]  love that weed I and then we all lost the cut you know so I had some I had
[54:51.000 --> 55:01.600]  some crosses that I had made with it but in 2019 or maybe yeah I think in
[55:01.600 --> 55:09.880]  early in 2019 he hit he we were talking to hit me up and he sent me out a huge
[55:09.880 --> 55:16.440]  library of seeds thousands of seed in that library it was all crosses from
[55:16.440 --> 55:23.440]  those blueberry lines it was stuff with the MK ultra that he did in 2003 and
[55:23.440 --> 55:28.960]  then there's a bunch of super silver haze stuff too so like he had a like
[55:28.960 --> 55:34.240]  here's one right here max 49 grapefruit times super silver haze and that I think
[55:34.240 --> 55:40.800]  was from 2001 here's the blueberry skunk which is what that was one of the ones
[55:40.800 --> 55:45.000]  he did the skunk one he hit with the with that blueberry male so he had a
[55:45.000 --> 55:50.240]  blueberry skunk and actually that weed that was one of the weeds that I didn't
[55:50.240 --> 55:55.560]  grow a lot of it but it was one of the ones that if I smoke that I was like
[55:55.560 --> 56:03.200]  non-functioning I couldn't function smoking it Wow did that ever wear off or
[56:03.200 --> 56:06.840]  did it just you know two months three months later still hitting you the same
[56:06.840 --> 56:12.040]  well you know to be honest it wasn't consistently around like some of the
[56:12.040 --> 56:18.520]  other strains so I would get it from him whenever he he ran it because I
[56:18.520 --> 56:24.080]  would you know be slaying weed or whatever but I love that one as far as
[56:24.080 --> 56:28.280]  the high goes so I had that I had a bunch of the like that's crossing the MK
[56:28.280 --> 56:36.280]  ultra there's some other ones crossed into MK ultra as well the train wreck
[56:36.280 --> 56:41.040]  blueberry MK ultra so what I did is I found you can I can still find stuff
[56:41.040 --> 56:46.280]  that's really heavily leaning towards that blueberry train wreck okay my
[56:46.280 --> 56:50.440]  original cross because he did take that you know clone and he crosses the MK
[56:50.440 --> 56:56.960]  ultra back in 2003 and that's what I use on the Mac I use a Mac V2 on female
[56:56.960 --> 57:02.360]  selection to make the blueberry train Mac and this I'll run through more of
[57:02.360 --> 57:06.560]  these because I still have a bunch of seeds of this so I'll run through and
[57:06.560 --> 57:12.200]  I'll find like a really nice male and I'll do a version 2 and I'll put it on
[57:12.200 --> 57:18.320]  my female selection of the V2 and then I'll keep working this blueberry train
[57:18.320 --> 57:24.280]  wreck so I can try to get closest to that original profile but also have the
[57:24.280 --> 57:30.600]  you know the structure that I want so I can run it in a commercial setting
[57:30.600 --> 57:35.840]  Romulan blue this one's really this one's funky the Romulan blueberry times
[57:35.840 --> 57:45.520]  MK ultra smells like a dirty harbor and I live by the ocean man so I instantly
[57:45.520 --> 57:51.360]  got a smell in my nose I that's it's really hard to describe but that's like
[57:51.360 --> 57:55.240]  the closest thing there's not like oh it's got a little bit of this a little
[57:55.240 --> 58:00.600]  bit of this it just smells like dirty harbor it's like tires sewage fish guts
[58:00.600 --> 58:07.520]  it's it just it just has a overall foulness to it that's awesome so I
[58:07.520 --> 58:13.480]  really like that I'll go back to that the PK Johnny Blaze I ran some of it I
[58:13.480 --> 58:18.080]  think that you would to really find something phenomenal I would have to do a
[58:18.080 --> 58:25.280]  lot larger selections now me and Dave and you know a lot of the other guests
[58:25.280 --> 58:30.580]  we always have this thing we always like hold back to now I imagine you have more
[58:30.580 --> 58:35.460]  than you know 10 seeds or 20 seeds that we start with but do you hold back a
[58:35.460 --> 58:40.980]  certain percentage of seeds so you like can go back later if you were like man I
[58:40.980 --> 58:48.780]  should have cloned that one yep I always do that so like I have I have some stuff
[58:48.780 --> 58:54.620]  that mean gene gave me that I'm doing that I'm crossing back doing back crosses
[58:54.620 --> 59:01.860]  on so I in 2019 I gave him one a lime orilla clone of mine and then he put his
[59:01.860 --> 59:06.420]  f4 lime I think it was a little lime f5 on it and then he gave me some seeds
[59:06.420 --> 59:13.700]  back and I put my lime orilla put put it back onto my lime orilla and I'm not
[59:13.700 --> 59:22.260]  putting those into production or anything I'm just using it to have like
[59:22.260 --> 59:29.820]  more of that chem soap lime profile and keep that in that form so I can use it
[59:29.820 --> 59:36.940]  you know later on if I want it but you know I popped all this you know the
[59:36.940 --> 59:41.940]  majority of the seeds that I got and then I kept like maybe like 10 you know
[59:41.940 --> 59:46.580]  just so I could be like okay so I'm pheno hunting all of this stuff out but
[59:46.580 --> 59:51.020]  I'm holding back you know maybe like 10 seeds because it's like something
[59:51.020 --> 59:55.180]  happens or something goes wrong then you know or if I want to go back into it
[59:55.180 --> 59:58.260]  later on and be like hey you know I really like some of the stuff I found in
[59:58.260 --> 01:00:03.620]  there and I want to go you know see what what else is in there and stuff you know
[01:00:03.620 --> 01:00:08.180]  so I do that especially with things that I have a really small quantity of you
[01:00:08.180 --> 01:00:15.430]  know I'll test run it see you know what it's looking like and test run it yep
[01:00:15.430 --> 01:00:20.670]  yeah it's you know if you get a whole bunch of different expressions that's
[01:00:20.670 --> 01:00:24.310]  one thing but usually if it's solid and you still have those you know that 10%
[01:00:24.310 --> 01:00:27.930]  or that little bit held back hopefully you're like all right I get get back to
[01:00:27.930 --> 01:00:33.350]  it it's just I was just looking through chat there somebody there they were
[01:00:33.350 --> 01:00:38.310]  talking about the the blueberry train wreck Mac and they're they're just
[01:00:38.310 --> 01:00:41.190]  throwing it props I'm like damn it where did it go I was gonna put that up there
[01:00:41.190 --> 01:00:46.550]  I always like to put up props because people are enjoying your gear and we did
[01:00:46.630 --> 01:00:56.070]  have another question ask him to talk about his black lights okay my my
[01:00:56.070 --> 01:01:03.430]  favorite that I that I like to smoke and then I like to use to breed with I love
[01:01:03.430 --> 01:01:07.830]  the high and I love the terpene profile it is it's the lime orilla it's the
[01:01:07.830 --> 01:01:11.710]  black lime reserve by gorilla glue and so I do a lot of crosses with that you
[01:01:11.710 --> 01:01:16.070]  know I keep it around and I you know have it over here in my my tank I have
[01:01:16.110 --> 01:01:21.150]  actually I have one going back on to black lime reserves so I have a black
[01:01:21.150 --> 01:01:27.910]  lime reserve male and I select it out is really fucking awesome male and I am
[01:01:27.910 --> 01:01:31.950]  gonna you know in breed it and then I'm gonna take that and then put it back on
[01:01:31.950 --> 01:01:37.790]  the gorilla glue because I have and then I'm gonna do a v2 regular version of the
[01:01:37.790 --> 01:01:41.310]  because I have my gorilla glue and I have that black lime reserve male so I
[01:01:41.310 --> 01:01:47.190]  have those projects that I'm working on but what was the question I was asking
[01:01:47.190 --> 01:01:52.790]  about the black light the black lights okay so I took the I took the lime
[01:01:52.790 --> 01:01:59.150]  gorilla and I crossed that a couple years ago on to Mac v2 right and then I
[01:01:59.150 --> 01:02:16.420]  F and I F to that what then I cross that with with oh no see this is the I
[01:02:16.420 --> 01:02:21.780]  this is limelight crossed into black lime reserve so it's lime orilla Mac v2
[01:02:21.780 --> 01:02:26.380]  crossed in the black lime reserve okay yeah see black lime reserve times lime
[01:02:26.380 --> 01:02:34.300]  limelight when limelight is lime orilla times Mac v2 f2 I haven't grown the Mac
[01:02:34.300 --> 01:02:41.380]  myself personally very popular one have you tried that one yet Dave do you ever
[01:02:41.380 --> 01:02:46.100]  get your hands on the top up there is a picture of it oh wow those three at the
[01:02:46.100 --> 01:02:53.500]  top that's a match me to cut yes I still have it it's in my tent as well
[01:02:53.500 --> 01:02:57.620]  Matt Mac is gorgeous it's a gorgeous gorgeous plant like there's no doubt
[01:02:57.620 --> 01:03:02.940]  about it there's a reason why it's so popular and successful and yeah it's
[01:03:02.940 --> 01:03:06.260]  definitely got a great turt profile that uh some people either love or hate it
[01:03:06.260 --> 01:03:09.140]  though which kind of kills me because it's just delicious
[01:03:09.140 --> 01:03:14.060]  we choose a little bit different and high is way different and I like the v2
[01:03:14.060 --> 01:03:20.340]  cut because the high on it is like right right up my alley that's the one that
[01:03:20.340 --> 01:03:25.820]  checks checks the effects box for you yeah which is important and you know
[01:03:25.820 --> 01:03:29.580]  that's kind of one of the things too we're talking about you know I want a
[01:03:29.580 --> 01:03:34.180]  profile that just like slaps you in the face there's no denying what it is when
[01:03:34.180 --> 01:03:37.900]  you have those sort of profiles there's always gonna be the either like it or
[01:03:37.900 --> 01:03:42.180]  don't like it crowd there's never really a middle with with that type of stuff
[01:03:42.180 --> 01:03:46.420]  it's always like yeah banging or nope not my cup of tea
[01:03:46.420 --> 01:03:54.500]  Maggie to that's a good one right there yeah just quickly quickly I saw him in
[01:03:54.500 --> 01:04:00.580]  a chat earlier but we got the the vintage cheddar from mr. toad I have
[01:04:00.580 --> 01:04:09.420]  some I have some of his days for days I think he's at four I've got yes
[01:04:09.420 --> 01:04:15.140]  recently well I think I showed him on the last show the last batch for mr.
[01:04:15.260 --> 01:04:19.900]  toad but he's he's coming up with stuff and he gets a lot of seeds out to people
[01:04:19.900 --> 01:04:24.900]  so I'm stoked to see those and I like his packaging to solve the
[01:04:24.900 --> 01:04:29.140]  biodegradable handwritten you can use that for multiple different strains
[01:04:29.140 --> 01:04:35.980]  smart man you wanted more lemon hoco by the way I did want more lemon hoco what
[01:04:36.140 --> 01:04:46.500]  what make it rain Dave okay anybody in the crowd can you guess guess one of
[01:04:46.500 --> 01:04:51.460]  those strains that he just tossed out anybody in chat that'll be fun one and
[01:04:51.460 --> 01:04:56.060]  and for playing along too I'll pop up or I'll drop that link again to save 10%
[01:04:56.060 --> 01:05:02.300]  off at the Bokashi earthworks site using the SCP code drop that one here and chat
[01:05:02.300 --> 01:05:06.060]  again while you guys are trying to figure out one of those strain names
[01:05:06.060 --> 01:05:16.860]  thanks for playing so much stuff to go through it'll take me a long long time I
[01:05:16.860 --> 01:05:20.900]  know I'm sitting here I'm sitting here looking at you know the seeds that I
[01:05:20.900 --> 01:05:24.340]  brought out for this show and I'm kind of like looking at the time already oh
[01:05:24.340 --> 01:05:29.140]  my gosh we're already at we're we're a little bit over our time guys so we're

[01:05:36.060 --> 01:05:40.820]  everybody you can prepare your lightning round Dave get a lightning round Brandon
[01:05:40.820 --> 01:05:44.780]  if you want to grab a few things do lightning round I'm just gonna I'm just
[01:05:44.780 --> 01:05:50.460]  gonna quickly go through and lightning round my my collection from this last
[01:05:50.460 --> 01:05:57.260]  since since the last show so all right so we're talking beelief earlier the

[01:06:15.620 --> 01:06:21.700]  of his crosses but this one divine truffle that one showed up this is
[01:06:21.700 --> 01:06:28.100]  divinity number 35 times the white truffle excited to get into that another
[01:06:28.100 --> 01:06:33.260]  one here we I'm not even gonna try to say that last name it's love trunking

[01:06:57.900 --> 01:07:03.220]  got focus problems tonight there we go white burgundy and then the the cross on
[01:07:03.220 --> 01:07:07.700]  this one I forgot it was the daily daily grape number nine times the dip and
[01:07:07.700 --> 01:07:13.180]  sticks so those were my beeliefs that'll be very like can't it'll have like a
[01:07:13.180 --> 01:07:21.100]  heavy candy profile on it that's yeah sweet I'm looking forward to that one
[01:07:21.100 --> 01:07:26.580]  let's see here mean gene we're talking mean gene my mean jeans collection is
[01:07:26.580 --> 01:07:32.460]  starting to grow that goes to OG times guy Jaro that will be a fun one that's
[01:07:32.460 --> 01:07:37.180]  got some good flavor profiles again I want to shout out to James real quick
[01:07:37.180 --> 01:07:42.020]  too we're talking on the show last time I said you know Bubba kush kushes kind
[01:07:42.020 --> 01:07:46.460]  of help my stomach that's kind of why I got into cannabis don't really have a
[01:07:46.460 --> 01:07:52.640]  good one he sent me shramba which is fucking dope because shram is one of my

[01:08:08.460 --> 01:08:16.940]  kush from katsu seeds I'm stoked to get into those and also his you know
[01:08:16.940 --> 01:08:21.820]  sirebrader we're talking about you know people the unheard on the slept on
[01:08:21.820 --> 01:08:26.860]  kinetics genetics he said this is my buddy up from Traverse City you have got
[01:08:26.860 --> 01:08:35.260]  to try his stuff this is right yep the chem D times sour grapes and then
[01:08:35.260 --> 01:08:39.540]  another one the Grand Traverse tart cherry which is awesome because when I
[01:08:39.540 --> 01:08:44.700]  was a kid and I lived in Michigan we would go to Grand Traverse so I'm kind
[01:08:44.700 --> 01:08:48.700]  of stoked to pop something on that so that's my lightning round that's what
[01:08:48.700 --> 01:08:55.180]  I've done since the last show we're gonna wrap it up pretty soon but I don't

[01:17:37.640 --> 01:17:42.600]  deep dive into some of their selections some of their reasoning and some of
[01:17:42.600 --> 01:17:48.520]  their strains get the stories behind the stuff that you love so that'll be coming
[01:17:48.520 --> 01:17:53.080]  up and I got to give a big shout out to Dave for making these things happen so
