there is almost no worries on viruses, diseases, and anthracnose whatsoever
sometimes I see some tobacco buttworm but that is not really problematic until now
but it is very easy to control aphids and powdery mildew.
this concept of JADAM system with notes it is the same species that we grow in the field
and now we are into second harvest.
the first harvest was completed and I think we'll still do a lot more with this time
I haven't tilled this soil for about three years
in the past this place was filled with chemical pesticides and fertilizer
hello everyone my name is Youngsang Cho and welcome to JADAM
in this video I'm going to teach you how to control anthracnose and powdery mildew with JS and JWA
which is powerful enough to replace conventional chemical pesticides
this method can reduce the input cost up to 95%
and also it is a great alternative solution for PLS the positive least system in South Korea
it is not our insistence
in fact we have been working with National Science Department of South Korea for more than three years
it has been proved by the research that these solutions are very effective against anthracnose
and many other diseases
we have made a report about the result and now it is published on paper of our government
to ease the struggles of the farmers
also there are no chemical pesticide residue found in JS and JWA
the ingredient that we used in here are also allowed in USDA
it is officially recognized by the Department of Agriculture of South Korea
and the law mentioned it is eligible to use JS and JWA for organic crop production
most of the products in the market for controlling anthracnose are very expensive
however as you can see it can be manufactured with very affordable cost with very powerful effects
the sulfur's melting point is around 120 Celsius degree
but I have invented a method that could melt sulfur without heating on fire
the manufacturing process is very simple
just by adding caustic soda, sulfur and some more ingredients
you can have surprisingly effective natural disinfectant
let me briefly show you how it's done
as you saw in the video the whole process is very simple and easy
the more detailed videos are uploaded on our YouTube channel and on our website
we highly recommend farmers to make their own inputs
which enables farmers to thrive in this harsh period of time
now let me move to JWA
this is a wetting agent or also known as emulsifying agent
made with natural canola oil and potassium hydroxide
which also can be made without heating on fire
it plays most essential role for all pesticides use
on the other hand when it is used in large quantity it can also be natural pesticide
so let me show you how it is made
you have just watched how to make natural wetting agent for pesticides
as you can see the procedure is very simple
wetting agents for farming is bit expensive
but if you make your own it costs only 60 cents per liter
this wetting agent can be also used as dishwashing soap
I believe that JS and JWA is the best solution for treating anthracnose and many other disease
you'll see the difference when you compare with other products
with this ratio of JS and JWA you can control anthracnose
you can reduce the amount of JWA for powdery mildew as well
mix all this with soft water then spray during early morning
you will be able to see the anthracnose stops
with this technology you can enter the whole new era of ultra low cost agriculture
this is inside of our greenhouse where we farm chilies
it is the same species that we grow in the field
and now we are into second harvest
the first harvest was completed and I think we'll still do a lot more with this time
I haven't tilled this soil for about three years
in the past this place was filled with chemical pesticides and fertilizers
but as soon as we came in we used JMS to purify the soil
and use all the JADAM method and then as you can see the result it is perfect
this field is an organic certified
never used any conventional chemical fertilizer
also it has been about five years without tilling the soil
as time passes it is growing bigger and higher than previous period
that being said also harvest increases year after year
apart from JADAM's input the other secret to this result is simple as well
we do not till the soil and we plant chili on the same bed every year
also steel pipes are permanently fixed in one spot to hold the chilies
and we just spread compost on the surface by uncovering the landscape fabric
the detailed information about these are uploaded on our website
so please go ahead and watch it
most important thing is irrigating JMS before transplanting
then irrigate diluted JMS with one to two weeks interval
when the growth is not good enough
then I add food waste liquid fertilizers which is rich in nitrogen
these chilies will grow higher than human height at the end of the season
and the yield is approximately three times more than conventional method
I harvest around 120 chilies per one plant
this system allows farmers to have about 500 grams of chili powder per tree
there are a lot of skeptics about the yield and the taste of organic products
however it is not true
the yield will increase rapidly when organic method is applied correctly
and there is no problem on pest and disease control
all problems can be solved by using JWA, JS, and Ginkgo extracted water which is JHS
there is almost no worries on viruses, diseases, and anthracnose whatsoever
sometimes I see some tobacco buttworm but that is not really problematic until now
but it is very easy to control aphids and powdery mildew
this concept of JADAM system with no tillage and high yield method
is actually very new compared to conventional method
but it is way better
another thing is since I'm not tilling the soil
which means less work and no heavy use of machinery
which leads saving fuel and less carbon dioxide
it is not so difficult to learn these methods
so please try this method for your own good
thank you
the video that you have just watched is our organic farm in Daejeon, South Korea
as you could see the yield is a lot more than conventional method
also stable growth of plants with organic method
I have been dedicating this work for more than 30 years
and now we have about 70,000 farmers practicing JADAM in Korea
our goal is to promote ultra low cost farming
one nation will fail if farmers does not have the rights of the technology in agriculture
it is even becoming harder for farmers to survive after FDA and all the agreements
and after COVID-19
I hope this technology could help everyone to have the power
to bring back rights of the farmers
this book was written by myself about organic farming
there is about 40,000 people who have read this book just in Korea
it became famous and we translated into different languages
also it is available through amazon.com and also in google playbook
I believe this book will be helpful for those who are curious
thank you for watching
