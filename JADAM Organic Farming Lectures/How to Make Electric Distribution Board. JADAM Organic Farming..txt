How to make a shipboard
Hello, I'm a JADAM Researcher
Today I'm going to show you how to make a shipboard
I'm not a professional, but you can make it yourself
Let's get started
This is a wiring blocker
If there is an overload or an overvoltage, the electricity will automatically turn off
The electric wire will come in here and go out here and connect here
This is 50 amps
This is a radio blocker
In the rain, the electricity will automatically turn off
This is a switch
I made four
This is a 3kW electric heater
The rest are water heater, automatic motor, and a mixer
I'm going to assemble it now
Tools are a wood bar, a wrench, and a screwdriver
The tip is thin
This is a P-BUSH screwdriver
It's 28mm in size
And I need a bigger one
This is 45mm
These two will be used to put the screws
You can prepare 20 each
I'll fix this first
One, two, three, it's fixed
I'm going to connect the wires here
I've already done this
I'll show you how to remove the wires
Hold it like this
This is a P-BUSH
Turn it like this
Hold it with a wrench
It's done
I'm going to make one side longer
I'll put it here
It's done
This is not a regular wire
It's about 2mm thick
I chose a thick wire because it's likely to be a lot of electricity
It's sold as a power supply
I'll connect the P-BUSH here
The main wire will go in here
This is a 3kW power supply
I'll connect it directly
This is a jumper
I'll try
It's done
I'll connect it here
It's done
The yellow one will be connected to the yellow one
It's done
I'll connect it here
It's done
The black one is connected here
It's done
It's done
I'll connect it here
The yellow one will be connected here
It's done
I'll connect it here
It's done
I'll connect it here
I'll connect it here
I'll connect it here
The code will be displayed on the screen.
Let's install the code.
I will use this 3kW power supply.
Insert the cable here and pull it out.
If the length of the code is short,
There is a hole at the bottom.
You can plug in the cable and connect it.
I had a hard time installing this.
I had a hard time installing this.
We usually turn on the water.
We forget to turn on the water.
If you want to give 20 minutes,
The code will be turned off in 20 minutes.
If you install the code here,
You can control the time to give water.
This is 15,000 won.
This is a 1.5kW water pump.
If you leave it like this,
It won't turn off over time.
So I added this option.
It's convenient to use.
If you plug it in like this,
The time is stopped.
I can control it for 15 minutes, 20 minutes, and 1 hour.
If you turn on the switch, it will work.
If you turn it off, it will turn off.
If you turn on the main switch, it will work.
This is a switch.
Thank you for watching.
