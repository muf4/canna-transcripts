I will help you to make your own practice machine.
First, you need an extension.
The standard extension for 100 won is 12A, 15A, 20, 25, 35, 40.
The parts are set accordingly.
I will show you how to make it.
This is a drill.
This is a hole cutter for 15A.
This is a 20A hole cutter.
This is a cheap one.
This is a cheap one, but it is cheap.
It costs about 15,000 won.
This is a drill.
This is a cutter for cutting the X-pipe.
You can cut it like this.
This is a monkey spinner.
It says 36mm here.
It means that it can cover up to 36mm.
This is small, but it can cover up to 48mm.
I chose this short one because it is used in this container.
You can buy it on the Internet.
Some are cheap and some are expensive.
You can choose the extension you want.
I will show you how to make a 25L container.
I have this container.
You can make any container from a trash can.
I chose this because it is the most common container in the world.
I think it is a good container to put 25L.
If the container is too big, it will be difficult to put the resin.
If it is too small, it will be less efficient.
So I chose a relatively small container.
If you use 25L resin, you can make 10 to 20 tons of resin per time.
If you use a lot of water, the concentration of calcium and magnesium will not be as high as you think.
But the storm is small, so you can use a lot of water.
If you use a lot of water, the function of the resin will be low.
Then you can reuse the resin by repeating it 15 times.
If you make it once, you can use it for a long time.
I will explain the parts of the water heater.
This is a 20A pipe.
This is a water pipe.
This is a water pipe.
This is a pipe for connecting the XL pipe.
This is the container for storing the PHI pipe.
This container is used as a tephore.
When water is actions on the top of the pipe, a valve is added.
The most important thing is the top and bottom of the pipe.
This is the drain panel that forms the connection part of the pipe.
This is the drain panel that forms the connection part of the pipe.
It uses two tape strips.
This is an air freshener and this is an electrical tape.
I will start working with this much of the parts.
There are a few things to be careful about when working.
Don't overdo it, don't put too much force, and don't wear gloves.
If you do something wrong, you can get hurt because you are using a tool.
This is the hole where the water goes in.
This is a thick container.
You have to be careful when drilling.
You can drill the hole where the water comes out and the hole where it goes in.
You can drill it from the back.
I'll drill it.
I'll insert a 15A hole cutter.
Don't overdo it, take your time.
I'm going to make the bottom hole a little more water.
I'm going to work with 15A on top and 20A on the bottom.
Don't overdo it, take your time.
I'm going to work with 15A on top and 20A on the bottom.
It took me a while because the bottom was thick.
The hole where the water comes out and the hole where it goes in.
The hole that goes in here is a little stronger than the pressure.
There's a big one here.
Depending on your purpose, if this is a big container, you can make a bigger hole here.
You have to be careful.
The water that goes in here has to be filled and the water has to come out.
If you make a big hole and the water comes out too well,
Because the water is not filled, only a part of the water is used.
So you can adjust it appropriately.
If you can't adjust it, you can use a valve to fill the water.
This is the most important part of the water purifier.
It's called a double-sided water purifier.
The particles are as thin as sand.
If you don't use a high-temperature net, the water will be washed away.
This is 120mL.
This is a material that can be found all over the world.
It's a part of the female chemical industry.
I'm going to make it with this.
This is a 20A PVC socket.
I'm going to put this in here.
I'm going to wrap the tape once to make a gap.
I'll wrap it around the end.
And I'll put this in.
It fits perfectly.
Next, I'll tape it to the end.
I'll do five turns.
One, two, three, four, five.
And then turn it around and lower it.
It's done.
It's well-made, right?
Now, I'm going to block the hole.
I'm going to use a rubber cap to block it.
I'll put this in.
It's small, right?
It's done.
This is a 40mm joint.
I'll put it in the bottom.
It's 100% stainless steel, so I'll use a nail.
I'll put this in.
It's a little big, so I'll put a ring on it.
I'll put a line on the end.
It's done.
If you think this part is a little blocked,
you can cut it off.
It's done.
It says 20A.
If you say 20A, you can get the right material easily.
I'll put the rubber inside.
I'll use a monkey's pen to hold it in.
I'm going to turn it around.
If you tighten it too much, the rubber inside may break.
I'll put it in moderately.
It's the finished part.
I'll put 8 turns on the tape.
I'll put it in.
You can turn it around with your hands.
It's done.
I'll put a nipple in the middle to attach the 20A valve.
I'll connect it.
Five, six, seven.
Do the same on this side.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
Hold it.
It's done.
If you go to a hardware store, they sell 20A axles.
If you don't need a lot of material,
you can buy 1m and cut it off.
I'll put this in to connect it.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
I'll put a nipple in the middle.
I'll put a nipple in the middle.
This is the hose.
The ring should be at the end.
And then,
I'll put it in.
I'll put a nipple in the middle.
It's done.
It's a bit awkward, right?
It's because it's a bit steep.
But you will be using this container
after you put it high up.
So you shouldn't be too high up.
If you put it too high up,
it will be less efficient for the water.
So I lowered it as much as I could.
This is 15A.
It's the container for the water.
Put it in.
Now it's done.
Now it's going to go inside.
It's connected.
It's going to go inside and be a water.
Let's do it.
8 turns.
The other side.
Now to connect this.
This is 16 turns.
It's a bit much.
If you think
that the water level is low
because it's steep,
you can bend this part
and install it
beforehand.
This is what you use
in the farm.
I will connect this
to the water.
There is a gap
between the screws.
So I will make sure
that the water doesn't leak.
Put this in.
Put this in.
Put it in.
If you can't put it in,
you can put a layer of cement
in the middle.
See?
There is a valve here.
You will be using it
if you put it too high up.
If you put a valve here,
it will be hard to work later.
So you can put it
in the right position
and put the valve.
Now
it's done.
If you can do this,
you can use a water-solution.
This is
a water-solution.
It's a good one
from Biel.
This is 25 liters.
I will put this in.
The water-solution
is stuck in the valve.
If you put it in,
a lot of water
will be under the valve.
So
you can fill
the bottom with rocks
and put the water-solution
on top of it.
If you put a water-solution
in the valve,
the water will be filled
and the water will be drained.
You can test the water
with a salt.
You can check
if the water is drained
and use it.
If the water is drained
and the water is not filled,
you can use the salt
and restore the water-solution
and reuse it.
You can use it
for 15 times.
Also,
in winter,
if you put it outside,
the water-solution
will be less able
to exchange the water
because of the cold.
If you are
having a hard time
buying these,
we will be selling
a set of these
starting this week.
If you order,
you can buy it at a reasonable price
and make a separate container
and a water-solution.
If you buy this,
you can make
a 25L container
and a large container
for about $150.
Stainless steel containers
are expensive
but the advantage is
that the water is supplied
and the water is drained quickly.
If you do this,
you can make a cheap
water-solution.
This is where the water
is drained.
If you want to
use it in a farm,
you can raise
the water level
and put the container
on top of it.
This will make
it easier for you
to work.
If you raise the water level
to your work environment,
it will be convenient for you
to work.
Let's see how much water
comes out.
The size of the container
is large.
The pressure is strong
and the water will come out
more.
I'll put 1L of water
and see how long it takes.
It takes 7 seconds to fill 1L.
You can calculate
how much water you can
put in.
Let's put 500L of water.
Then 3,500 seconds.
60 minutes
divided by
500L.
It takes 60 minutes.
How long does it take
to fill 20L?
60 minutes divided by
20L.
It takes 2.3 minutes.
When you calculate the salt level,
you put 25L of water
in the container.
And you put a stone
in the container.
You put 10L of water
and 3kg of salt
in the container.
Then you fill the container.
Then
the water will remain.
If the water remains,
you can pour it out
and fill the container
with salt.
If you make the water
to be enough,
the salt will go down.
If the water is enough,
you can fill the container.
And
you can play the salt
for more than 12 hours.
