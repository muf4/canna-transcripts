I'm going to tie two pipes together.
The size of this stand band is 32 to 44mm.
This is the size.
This is the length that fits this.
So I'm going to loosen it.
So it's not like this.
It has to be like this.
What's the difference?
Then it won't go in well later.
Why do you put one more of this?
This is for left and right.
How much space do I have to make?
The space?
I made four of them.
The size is 1 eighth.
It's a wire cutting machine.
This is how it's cut.
In this state, the line is a little loose.
To give it elasticity,
Pull this.
If you pull the pipe forward, it becomes tight.
